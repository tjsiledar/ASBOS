            "Excellent Phone.. great camera quality, good battery backup, good performance really worthy",
            "Good\nIt's Good in Camera Front and Back\nBattery is Good 4500 mah\nDesign excellent\nBack orbit light is excellent\nOS is good\nDisplay I find slightly contrast is less compare to oppo Reno 3 pro which is two years old.it may be new technology 90 hz refresh rate.\nRam and storage is good",
            "After using one full week satisfied with the phone. As per specification mentioned, the phone is a good one to look for. Price wise it is on a higher side. There is no lag in performance at all. Battery is good, touch feel is awesome, looks premium. Full charge in 32 minutes(approx). Camera is good, may be better after software update. Low light performance is average. Selfie looks good and crisp. Colour is little bit enhanced than actual. Pectures are softer if taken with zoom. Overall it is not a flagship one.",
            "Really amazing features in the camera .. potrait mode is the best .65 watts fast charging full charged in 31mins ..really amazing product from oppo and it's another sucess in the Reno series still so many features is hidden and verifying each. Overall worth for the price ..",
            "Best phone in this range...best camera and best battery backup and charging Speed also fast (30min only) Vivo V 23 pro is also better than this but it cost high. I won't suggest to go for Vivo. Its just a camera phone.\nOne last thing built-up quality is great and solid...\nNever go for curvy border phones like Vivo, curvy phone are not easy to handle. This reno 7 pro is boxy design...i love it and it's really easy to handle..and best for rough use.",
            "Updated review after around 2 months : Its no-doubt a beast in every aspect; packed with sooo many features and so much optimisation options. I upgraded from Reno 5 pro to Reno 7 pro.. and I feel its worth upgrading. Though I am missing curved edges but its fine; its sleek design impresses me too! Air gesture feature is missing as told in Launch event, I hope to see that in this may be by an OTA Update soon!! Battery backup is average to good. I miss Dolby sound while using buds and its so called Dirac sound provided is not that good! Camera is the biggest plus in this device {very well optimised} and selfie is awesome with lovely flare portrait mode. BGMI runs smoothly. I really loved the back light and star trail design and and and Stereo speakers are just woww! To sum up all; I would say:- Display, Design; Camera; Gameplay & usage interface are its biggest Pros! Battery, 3.5mm jack missing (neither any converter); Dolby not provided and Air gesture feature missing would be its minor Cons!! Well on a wider aspect... Its the perfect Flagship available right now....and I guess I will continue to be a Reno Superfan \ud83e\udd70",
            "After 1 day use\nBattery good no heating issue\nCamera good\nNo pubg testing but sure to he performe excellent\nDisplay nice\nLook great worthy\nBoya Mike working properly and excellent capture clear voice to making videos\nBreathing light awesome",
            "Other than the back design and SuperVOOC 65W Charge, nothing seems good about the phone.\nThe display of Reno 6 Pro with curved glass was far more superior than this phone which has an outdated flat screen design.\nThe phone is having brick-like design similar to Apple phones. It doesnt feel comfortable to hold in the hands. Doesn't seem slim at all.\nThe highlight of the phone, the Sony IMX camera sensor is not upto my satisfaction. Portraits have blurry edges and not much customisations by Oppo.\n1st update is already received and yet did not get satisfied with the camera photos. Selfies are a dampner. Even photos of low end phones from Vivo are far superior.\nSuch a phone with high specs doesn't support Live Screen.\nDoesn't have OIS or EIS,\nComes with old Android 11 out of the box instead of Android 12, and only 90Hz refresh rate at such a high price point.\nI would be happy to exchange this phone with something better.\nOverall, the price doesn't justify the specs and quality. I am disappointed. Oppo Reno 7 Pro is a loser.",

            "A must buy for portrait pic lovers. Build quality is great and phone is very lite weight.\nPerformance is very good for normal usage, did not try playing games n other heavy stuff.\n65 watt charger does it's job pretty well and phone gets charged within half an hour from 20 to 100%.\nCamera quality is really stunning. I own OP 9R, but camera quality of this Oppo Reno 7 Pro is altogether different experience, just wow.",
            "Good camera, good battery life with one and half day, but sound is not the best and a little over priced.",
            "Pretty neat phone. Delete all the unnecessary pre loaded apps. Phone works super smooth no worries at all. I used it normally for some social media, calling and chatting so serves the purpose well. Much better than my previous phone moto g5g so really happy with this purchase. Camera quality is good although photos at times do tend to look a little artificial. Operating performance along with the fast charge makes it a good deal. Guys, do consider this one.",
            "Its a Beast..\nSuperfast performance..\nNo doubt it's the best phone in this range. U can't get more.. I was lucky to get this phone at a crackling deal.\nI m writing this review after using it for more than 10days. I was skepticle to go for OPPO.. i already have One Plus 8 Pro, & this phone is no less in any aspect to One Plus 8 Pro.\nGuys, go for it without any single thought. You will love it..",
            "Very good product. I was using pixel 4 a. I shifter to oppo 2 days back. Initial impression is good. charges real quick. OS is good and stable. Have a lot of unwanted apps. but just delete them all. Coming from a stock android experience, I felt there are a lot of customizations available.\nI liked oxygen OS, but now it is being slowly masked into color OS completely, using color OS itself makes more sense.\nThis phone has solid build quality.\nThe best part is it weighs exactly like my pixel 4a. Bigger. but lighter.\nAmazing display.\nVery good cameras. But cannot compare it with pixels camera. Pixel camera is another league.\nBut the sony sensors are good. Front camera is doing a lot of skin smoothening unnecessarily. Girls will like it, as it will make them more artificial.\nPixels camera was raw. But oppos camera also does justice. It exceeded my expectations.\nOverrall reno 7 pro is a nice phone.",
            "Camera is just ok if we compared it with the price range in which it comes.\nDisplay is good but not best. Sound is good and yes handset is light weight and good to hold in hand.",
            "Good look but price is very high. Could have go with Reno7 5G instead of Pro. Backlight feature is really impressive.still I feel not worthy of 40k bucks.\n\nReview updated... Today this mobile got hanged bcs I just use basic feature of switching data from one sim to another. After that phone started blinking continuosly and heated too much.. feeling like just got cheated..\nUpdated...\nYesterday received update from oppo.. the above issue has been fixed",

Design of both phones are amazing \ud83d\ude0d..",
            "It's been 2 weeks I'm using it and satisfied and happy with the overall performance of the mobile.\n1. Beautiful design\n2. Butter smooth touch feel\n3. Awesome viewing experience with display\n4. Front and back cameras are too good except macro lens. Front camera is awesome, may or may not be the best in the segment, can't comment on it as I'm not that expert, but according to me, it's awesome.\n5. Battery back up is as expected from a 4500 mah battery, it's lasting for 24 hours for normal usage., but definitely not justified for the price. Must not be sufficient for Gamers, Could be some more better for 40K.\n6. Excellent build quality\n7. Charging speed is completely as the company claims. It's getting charged in 25 mins from 20 to 100% which is really helpful in the morning if we are in hurry to go somewhere and the battery is low by the time we wake up.\n8. Refresh rate is just 90hz where it should be 120hz for the price range., Truly, I never noticed big difference and I never felt any problem with it, but heavy Gamers must feel it as a big Con.\n9. Signal reception is excellent. No call drops, no problem in hearing both the sides.\n10. RAM and storage capacity is very good which is completely worth.\n11. First time I'm using Color OS and I liked it as much as I liked the Samsung UI, surely better experience over MIUI.\n12. Android 12 is not given out of the box and no update till now which is not expected from a 40K phone.\n13. No water resistance - I'm not sure whether it's expected for the price range or not, but could definitely became killer phone if the feature is given.\n14. Not a flagship phone. But still Processor is very good and RAM is high, also there is an option to increase RAM, so no problem with RAM management.\n\nOverall, one will be very happy to hold it and a highly recommend phone but only if we get it below 35K with any offers like bank offers or Flipkart sales etc. I feel, it's definitely not worth for 40K. I got 9K discount including bank offer and exchange bonus and 3K for old phone, so after exchanging my old phone and bought by using HDFC CC, I got the mobile for 28K and 30watt fast charging power bank for 1/- as an offer. All together, it's more than 100% worth in my case.",

I am happy because I got this type of feature that I want in my smartphone this + point of this smartphone.\nThis case quality of this phonee is average.\nOne more thing is that... When I saw this smartphone in Flipkart I think that it's display is too big but when I see it in my hand I shocked because in picture and real there is too plenty of different between image and real but the smartphone is very light weight .\nIt looks very professional in my hand I loved it but some - point make me unhappy\nOne more thing is that there is hybrid sim card in this mobile I was also confused which type sim card in it . We have to insert two sim card in this mobile from front and back\n1 sim Card we have instead from upper side and 2nd from back side there is no slot for memory card in this smartphone.\nAnything else I loved this smartphone because it is too much futuristic......but oppo have to work on battery my device is set up with in 15 min from old device\nCamera is very good both front and back",
