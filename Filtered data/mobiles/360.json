            "I used redmi note 3 for 3 years so I will be writing this review based on my experience of these 2 mobiles. I was reluctant to ditch redmi because I love MIUI. so I got the mobile yesterday and camera us good specifically micro camera as being a professional I need to take close photograph. switching between apps is smoothness, battery could have been better on 4G but still I will last 1 day(actually i expected more), charging is fast, screen guard is preapplied, case comes with mobile and is good and covers raised camera completely, even though I liked MIUI more but color OS is not much behind. happy with performance till now, rest I will update later.\n\nEdit:_Pictures are wonderful, battery is also good,",
            "Awesome device, and hats off to Flipkart for such speedy delivery.\nI ordered it on 4th Sep 12PM and it got delivered by 5th Sep 10AM.

Do check below details about each feature of this phone.\n\nPerformance: 10/10 - PubG works very smooth along with all applications\nDisplay: 9/10\nCamera: 8/10 - 48 MP Camera is not up to mark, but cool\nBudget: 10/10 - No other phone in this price range..best buy\nOverall : 10/10 - The best experience you can have.\n\nAlso, VOOC charge... charges 20% to 100% in just 35 minutes. Once fully charged, you can use it for whole day with using multiple apps.\n\nRegarding OS, Color OS 6, which has multiple new features. I have been using MIUI, but in love with Color OS now.\n\nTo conclude, I would definitely suggest to buy Realme 5 Pro \ud83e\udd70'",

            "The overall package is very good not great but yeah realme did listened to the feedback and checked and improved all necessary check-boxes in the 5Pro from the 3Pro.\n\nThe 1 major thing that I didn't liked in the phone is that you can't keep your phone's PIN any less or more than 6 digits, unlike other Android phones with minimum 4 digits requirement. ColorOS is workable, and I'm hoping for the RealMe OS to be really good. I also hope it changes the notification icons to plain white simple icons like other phones instead of showing the app icon in place of the notification icon (Chrome icon is shown instead of the incognito icon while using incognito mode in Google chrome).\n\nHoping RealMe to make the RealMe OS really worth it, the only let down in the phone is it's software the ColorOS.",
            "Realme is real value for money. I've purchased 8GB/128GB variant for my wife, yesterday. Lightening speed. Thumb unlock is so quick(better than my Samsung galaxy Note 8). Face unlock works even in dark. 48MP back camera is very good but not mind blowing. My 12+12MP camera of Samsung Note 8 take much better pictures than this quad cameras. Front camera takes excellent selfies. Touch screen is super responsive & bright. Battery backup is excellent. Charging is really fast. Protective Back cover provided by Realme is nice but it it hinders the finger movement at the screen edges, which is irritating. Overall Realme 5 Pro is a excellent phone and You may not repent buying this phone at Rs.17000. Go for it",

The maximum size of the 48mp pic by my Realme 5Pro has been 27.3mb and that is unbelievable.\n\nPortrait shots in daylight are amazing.\nWide angle camera does great job.\nFront camera works excellently well in daylight and night.\n\n4k video recording is unbeatable in the segment.\nFull hd video recording is great with EIS.\nSlow motion setting of different resolutions is pretty excellent.\nSuper slow motion is the best in the segment.\nFull hd video recording from front cam is very clear.\nSlow motion from front cam is available (through update).\n\nDisplay is not less than any super amoled in this segment.

            "As a technogeek i always consider the best phones with great processor and quality camera. And always kept an eye on budget phones these days as they're on huge sale right now. So when i planned to buy an budget device my options were Galaxy A50, Redmi Note7 Pro, RealMe XT, RealMe 5pro, RealMe 3pro. These were my options. And i have checked about every phone in detail. Out of all RedmiNote 7 pro and Real me 5pro came close as the experts ratings for these both were 8.9/10. But after personally using RealMe 5 pro, i consider that i made a great choice choosing RealMe5 pro over everyother budget smartphone available in the market right now. This is the best. Camera, Display, Processor especially for gamers and multitaskers this is beast for you. I would rate 9/10. The back panel is attractive but could've been better. Overall this is amazing.

            "i bought the 8gb/128gb edition. this is my review after using it for almost 25 days...\nPros\n\ncamera is just awesome, especially the nightscape mode. if you like taking pictures or selfies or capturing videos, this phone won't disappoint you.\n\nprocessor is really nice and fast. also,since it has 8gb ram, it probably won't be lagging for the next couple of years no matter how many apps you use simultaneously.\n\ngaming performance is also pretty good. no issues there\n\nscreen and display also has no issues, even under sunlight.\n\nCons\n\nbattery backup is not that good, for me it lasts almost 11-13 hours after almost continuous use of internet, i also play a lot of Pokemon go and use the camera for some time.. after all this battery last 12 hours average. also, i think 8gb ram is another reason for more battery consumption, so battery backup might be better in 6gb edition.\n\napart from this, I don't think anything else is much of an issue. at this price tag, it is just fine. maybe a software update will help the battery backup issue.",
            "After 1 month usage :\nRealme 5 pro 8Gb/128Gb.\n[ Earlier used Redmi Note 5 3Gb/32Gb ]\n\nPerformance 5/5 : No issues , reason more than sufficient ram and enough memory\n\nCamera 5/5: Having a wide angle lens really helps, I really liked the images and superb Artificial intelligence processing capabilities\n\nScreen 3/5 : Ips LCD so in inside room its good but perform poorly in sunlight which is a disadvantage\n\nSound 3/5 : Speaker is average, but am really disappointed with audio output, even mediocre phones of redmi can beat this pro mbl in that. Senheizer earphones tested, better with redmi. Their amp is really good.\n\nOS 3/5 : As compared to MIUI, Color Os seemed ordinary. MIUI has lots of many small small features which makes life really convenient in which realme lacks as of now. For example calender app of redmi will automatically download birthdays from facebook which realme mbls doesnot do. etc\n\nBattery 4/5 : Enough battery for 1 day medium usage. Charging is super fast with 20w charger\n\nGot this mbl in 15k.\nValue for money : 4.75/5",
            "The looks are awesome and quad camera is quite good with very new feature. Slow motion is superb. Charging with vooc takes max 1 to 1.5 hrs which is the best part. I feel it is lighter than Z1 pro compared with my friends phone. Sound quality is amazing I love it. Charging stays easily for 1 to 1.5 day if u r not game lover like Pubg.

Camera is undoubtedly wonderful.\n3. Performance is very good in given range of phones.\n4. FHD+ screen is very satisfying. Comparable to amoled.\n6. SIM reception and calling voice quality is good. no complaints there.\n7. Speakers are good. I had been using Honor and Lenovo phones previous. compared to both of them, sound is pretty loud and clear.\n8. value for money: I bought the device for 16k, with 8GB Ram and 128 GB HD. The device feels like it should be priced more than 20k with the given feel and Hardware provided.\n\nCons:\n1. No notification LED.\n\nNo others cons given the features provided in this price range.",

Screen size is just fine if you are a PDF reader type person then it will be quite good to have the phone.

Ultra macro mode is good but need fair amount of light for good pic. Battery life is good too but what I liked is the charging speed. Back cover with those four camera makes everyone eyes rolling. Yes of course games yes, I have played pubg and cod on it and it's butter smooth. Display is good too.",

Anyone should go for this without any dought. bettry performance is excellent while playing PUBG with HD graphics. Overall PUBG is running like charm. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nOnly one thing is disappointed me, Flipkart showed Dolby Atmos in the description but its not present in the device. After my purchase I found that the description was removed. So, if you are music lover this thing can disappoint you because sound enhancement is poor, bass is not good with headphones. But loud speaker is very loud.",
            "This realme 5 pro (8gb 128gb) performance is extraordinary, thery are giving 48mp camera it was awasome (quad cam), within seconds any software can install in this system, that much fast performance.\n\nAudio & video quality are awasome.\n\nFinger print is very fast.\n\nGaming space also very nice performance.\n\nWhile playing PUBG, producing less heat compare to other mobile and it will take 9 to 12 percentage of charge.\n\nThey are giving vooc flash charger 20w, it will help for fill your battery within 1hr and battery size is 4035mAh, I'm not feeling well about this battery size, because this battery is not fit for this mobile performance.\n\nMy suggestion is please upgrade this battery to 4500mAh is good for this performance.\n\n*********EVERYTHING IS AWASOME**********\n\n*********DARE TO LEAP*********",

            "I don't know what should i write about this handset.. I found it as the best deal in the market in comparison to the features offered by Real Me with respect to the price range..and I must say I was absolutely right. So i marked all feature wise rating between 4-5 star. However few observations right here\nPROS\n1. It has secure key pad for password field auto enabled.\n2. 48 MP camera and 2MP micro lens is really good.\n3. I liked the Photo Editing features. It has come with more variety then any other Oppo earlier models. Specially Doodle to mark specific thing.\n4. Do not get heated even if i watch two movies in consecutive way.\n5. Vooc charger is good. However not speedy like disk charge. But at this price its awesome.\n6. It has auto uploaded wall paper feature which gives me very beautiful wall papers in locked screen.\n7. Has finger print and face recognition option.\n8. In built virus / vulnerability scanner powered by Avast and more effective than earlier Oppo versions.\n9. It has Oppo Cloude backup features which can back up your manuals settings along with App and Data.\n10. It has dual channel network accelerator feature which allows the handset to use both Wifi and Mobile data to create a Hybrid network to boost internet speed.\n11. It has Head phone monitor feature which widely gets used in Karaoke Apps.\n12. It comes with Parental control and Driving assistant mode.\n13. Developer options gives you more control in comparison with earlier versions. Wel i am much more interested in using USB Debugging which is common in all Handsets \ud83d\ude01.\n\nCORNS\n1. The device gallary folder is not properly mapped with attachment upload functionality. I have to choose Google Photo to upload photos as attachment. From device gallary choosen don't get converted into attachment.\n2. It has 10x zoom but 48MP camera don't have zoom facility\u2639\ufe0f.\n3. Device recordin folder is not mapped to attachment. U can't select voice recording in as an mail attachment after writing the mail or in reply. But u can do reverse, u can attach recording first in new mail and then write the body \u2639\ufe0f.\n4. It do not give u option to set default browser as Chrome. Rather it opens in their inbuild browser where maximum links do not work or open properly.\n5. Upon clicking App specific link the browser open App mobile site / desktop site instead of the App\n6. The Backup do not have options to save recording. Also it can't backup all apps. At the time of recovery i lost few apps and i have to download them again.\n7. After Backup recovery few messages get converted into garbage language. I don't know why.\n8. The Maximum Bluetooth volume level is less compared to earlier Oppo handsets which gives limited volume range while connect to bluetooth speaker.\n9. Its inbuilt sound equilizer termed as real sound technology only works with headset.\n10. Google assistant works good whereas difficult to handle Alexa.\n11. And the last but not the least, my cell is compromised with same Device Number and IP as kind of company has manufactured two clone Handsets. I faced many problems due to this and wherever i have tried to trace the devices logged in I got two devices active with same Device name and ip rest all are signedout. For example Google account or LinkedIn etc remember all sign in devices with ip\ud83e\udd2f. Please checkout the below device details i marked as Snapshot.\n\nLooking at the features and benefits I am rating 3star.. but bounded to reduce the rest 2 due to manufacture defect which incured me significant losses.",

            "everything is fine except camera... camera can be improved..but they did not do .. they are just lunching new mobile every week. Its better to improve your software and every small things.. every glitch...\n\nit doest mean that i did not like it .. i like it but they dispointed me...",
            "Display quality is not better as compared to price in this range and does not have in display finger print scanner battery is little lower but good thing to have fast charger in the box camera sample and quality is good as compared to other phones in this range phone performance is good sound quality also loud.",

            "Just amazing device and really happy to have it. Fastest delivery ever, ordered on 30th Sept and received it on 1st Oct.",
            "Camera is pretty Good , Processor performing its roll\nas it required , amoled display is required in this segment but it's ok , I am very much impressed with the VOCC 3.0 Flash Charger , the battery backup is normal , Realme needs to work on battery performance. You can play Pubg in HD Graphics with high frame rate , no lagging , no framedrop as I observed within 2 to 3 hour of continuous gaming. Overall performance is great.",
            "very nice feature which I like..\n1. camera is above average but not the best in 48 mp, i mean I had more expectation when I heard that this is new feature.\n\n2. charger type :C charging very fast and quick. i think it's now better to buy a type c charger phone only.\n\n3. battery life is good.\n\n4. processor is good in speed. 8gb ram is best decision.\n\n5. back colors are very attractive like glass design, still back color variations are needed.\n\n\ni am happy with the phone after using it for 1 week",
            "Realme 5 pro have great designs and have great value for money but the thing is that Cameras are not good quality. When zooming there are many pixels present which makes images bad quality. 48 MP is nothing its just a show. Selfie camera is not at all good. Please make camera perfect. And battery is fast charging but reaching 100% it delays to show full charge. Rest others are great in realme 5 pro. Please make it better.",

It lasts little more than one day with moderate use of camera, whatsapp and calling.\nLook and finish is good and it has compact dimensions compared to the screen size offered. Its a great value for money purchase if you are getting good discounts. Phone comes with screen guard and plastic cover as standard accessory. The charger is big and bulky and there are no headphones included in the package.",

I have been using it since last 11 months and there are few problems which I have been facing since then are\n1) even though it is an octa core processor, some times lagging, when I open 5 or more apps at a time. Not that smooth as we expect.\n2) touch screen is also not running that smooth, threshold is high, not that quick.\n3) camera performance has been degraded a lot.\n4) display is also not so good, quite normal, definitely will get disappointed after using it for few months.\nFinally my suggestion is, to not go for it because currently so many varients are available in this price bracket which are far better than this in performing all the above actions hence try some other.",

One can additionally place 2 SIM cards. The battery has 4000mah so one does lose charge in a day of regular (non-gaming) use. Nonetheless, the fast charging is really good but for that you require the correct charger as in the package. The volume is great. However, the camera is only okay, and strangely so. My earlier Realme 2 Pro takes better pics, especially selfies. Maybe the Realme 5 Pro requires a software update in this regard.",

            "I was all along a Redme fan. First time gone for Realme and experience so far is reasonably satisfactory. Basis my experience so far, below are key inputs:\n\nPros:\n1. Good Camera - both front and back\n2. Battery - Reasonably good ; VOOC fast charger provided which works quite well\n3. Look - Nice built ; looks good\n4. Size - Perfectly sized ; easy to hold\n5. Features - All possible features available except the ones listed under next section\n6. Sound - Pretty good\n7. Memory - I have 8/128 combo which is much more than enough ; very smooth navigation ; separate Memory card slot makes it bigger\n8. Private Safe - This is a great feature to lock private pics, documents, audio ,video files\n9. Connectivity - Smooth connection with Bluetooth, WiFi, USB or external devices\n10. Screen guard - Phone came with company fitted screen guard\n11. Back case - Nice transperant cover provided in package\n\nImprovement Opportunities:\n1. Inbuilt App Lock is not available unlike Redme phones. I see it as huge drawback\n2. Time stamp on pics feature not available\n3. Auto Photo management in Gallery is not up to the mark. Not organized in user friendly manner ; sequencing, segregation, folder placements not optimal\n4. No battery charging indicator / light to monitor the progress / completion without touching the phone\n5. Screenshot option is Missing. You can take Video of the screen but not pic.\n\nHope Realme will fix the above issues in upcoming Version updates.\n\nIn all, a great buy. Value for Money.\n\nRecommended .",
            "The phone hardware is simply superb!!!\nOnly the display could have been AMOLED (go for xt if you can)..but I'm not complaining at all.\nOtherwise the build quality is good, the battery is good, VOOC charging is superb.\nAudio quality on the speaker and handset is excellent, but audio quality thru the headphone jack is ok ok, could have been better.\nDisplay is decent and under direct sunlight performs well.\nRear Camera takes exquisite pics.\nThe presence of a Wide angle camera gives this phone a great edge.\nSelfie camera is decent and does its job well, but won't excite you like the rear camera.\nFinger print scanner is fast and accurate, and even the face unlock works like a charm.\nStorage with the triple slot gives you enough room to expand to 256GB. (I have the 8/128 variant).\nRAM management is well done.\noverall hardware of the phone is very good.\n\nThe only and only let down you will experience is in the UI. COLOR OS 6.0 seriously is a downgrade for me when I switched from EMUI of Huawei. It feels like a Ferrari being driven around by someone who is just learning to drive.\nI just hope that REALME literally dumps COLOR OS and cones up with something similar to OXYGEN OS, when they release the much talked about Realme OS, and hopefully releases it for this model too.\nApart from COLOR OS ruining your experience, the phone is delightful and a breeze to use, go for it without hesitation if the UI is not much of a hassle for you.\nClick the like button if this has helped you.\n\n\nReview after 9 months of usage and after REALME UI update.\n\nThe review of the phone as regards the hardware is superb. I will add to my earlier review and say it is extremely well built phone and very sturdy ms able to take shocks and falls (of course cover is needed without a doubt). This phone is delightful as regards hardware simply go for it.\n\nBut as regards the UI even after update to REALME UI it is still unfriendly and difficult to handle simple tasks.\ne.g. notification of calls on whatsapp only gives ring tone and no visuals...you have to guess it's a WhatsApp call and open it and then you can pickup.\nSome very menial tasks are complicated by the UI unnecessarily.\nHope REALME improves Thier user experience with better UI in the next update.\nMy only grouse is the UI and nothing else.",

Not much of stutter or freezes(rarely any, might be just me)\nOnly thing that shocks me in positive light is how fast it charges lmao.\nSo yea, 8gb ram+128gb rom will not give you a monster and nor will the quad camera be anything great.\nI'd say a 4gb varient would be a clever choice. 4gb or 8gb ram gives nearly same experience and for storage you could buy a sd.

Also 48 mp camera is top notch.\n\nCons\nDisplay quality is not that good if that is your concern go for Samsung or LG.\nFront camera is not that good but it does the job for me.\nAnd some of the malware apps come along with it which u can't be uninstall so that can have serious security issues.\n\nBut overall nice and perfect product at this price range!\nNote : If you are planning to buy this phone in 2020 or onwards don't buy it although its good product but it comes from china, so support India and go for other brands like Samsung etc.\n#bycotchina #jaihind\nThanks peace \u270c\ufe0f.",

            "Why buy other phones like redmi note 9 pro max poco x2 etc.. when realme 5 pro is available?\nU get literally every thing in this package.\nPeople should stop going behind specs and know what u really want.\ud83e\udd74\nMy Honest Review after days of usage and research in youtube reviews.\nI suggest crystal green variant for a distinct and pleasing look.\n\nBUILD\n\nLet's be honest we all use mobile covers even if it is made of gorilla glass back and front and have glossy glass design.\nSo it's pointless to waste money on buying fragile glass only to get looks that won't be much visible with the cover on\nGlass can break.. but u get a durable plastic back with Realme 5 po and has a beautiful and unique design at the back that looks like glass and give premium looks .(not ultra premium feel ,since it's plastic) ,but plastic back is more practical as i said but still it have a nice close to premium feel too . Plastic is better for connectivity too.\nAmazing build quality. Survived drop tests (6 feet) and bend tests both conducted by Gupta tech.\n\nThickness is 8.9mm vs 8.7mm of poco x2..\n0.2mm = 0.02cm i.e not even half the length of 0.1cm (1/5 of 0.1cm) \ud83d\ude02 funny why people find it to argue..\n\nI still pefer notch over any modern camera placements.. it doesn't interrupt the flow of display..\nNew punch hole setup is irritaing for me.. most users don't like it but they get used to it. But it is a deal breaker for many users like me.\nPop up camera is great for full screen experience.. but durability issues. So notch is still more favorable than these new setups.\n\nDISPLAY - IPS LCD Full HD+ , support widevine l 1 for Netflix stuff\n\nI have Samsung s6 which have superamoled display.\nYes, there's a difference..but IPS LCD is proved to be more visible under direct sunlight + Colors are more accurate and not warm.. amoled have colours overenhanced which is appealing for eyes but at the expense of accuracy.. especially yellow colour.\nAmoled is more battery efficient by turning off pixels on dark mode..\nAt the end amoled may have slight edge on battery that's all.. u can opt for Samsung devices at this price at the expense of performance \ud83e\udd17.\n\nColor OS 6.0 based on Android 9.0(Pie)\n\nWhen you buy this device now, u will get a 2.82gb software update. Update it to get color os upgraded to the fullest. and u will get Realme lab option in settings which has dark mode option.\nDark mode can save u a lot of power and keeps the battery efficient for a long time.\nBut i've heard that people who again updated to Realme UI suffer from Camera quality reduction and battery drainage. So i don't update again for now.\nColor OS is a little bulky but it give a lot of customisation options that can satisfy any user.\nPre installed apps can be uninstalled\nAlso turn off 'Get recommendations' in settings > addition settings and also turn off smart assistant in Smart services option in settings. This makes the UI & battery efficiency greater.\n\nBATTERY : 4035mah ,20w VOOC 3.0 charger\n\nLast for more a day with medium use\nEasily last nearly a day with heavy use. ( Around 18-22 hours)\nWith light use last for many more days.\n\nI recommend to keep the battery% between 30 and 85- 90 for a longer battery life.\nMost of the Li ion batteries are efficient upto 300-500 charge cycles.. If u let the phone die(0%) and recharge it back to 100%, the number of charge cycles can reduce more.\nFor getting 1000-1500 charge cycle never let the battery % drop below 40 and never recharge it above 80% . Especially with fast charging.. battery can degrade quickly. So take care of that.\nCurrently my rate of drop while using 4g airtel internet + VOLTE and typing this review on Flipkart is 1% per 12 minutes (not excellent but above average)\n\nCAMERA : 48+8+2+2 MP\n\n48 MP primary camera with Sony IMX 586 sensor ( sensor in one plus seven ) is totally satisying\nThis device gives one of the best possible natural colours with lots of details , sharpness and edge detection in this entire segment.\nIn terms of natural colours it easily beats 64MP of Redmi note 8 pro. (Refer Trakin Tech on YouTube)\nElectronic video stabilization is available but comparatively not up to the mark.\n\nUltra wide lens reduces the overall quality a bit like any other device in the segment but is useful to capture large areas with decent quality.\nChroma boost can be used if u love enhanced colours over natural.\nI suggest opting the natural colours in 5 pro bcos it can be correctly edited later.\n\nNight mode gives great lighting without loss of lot of details but still some details are missing at the edges.\nVideo recording at night is satisfying for most users but not for camera nerds.\nMacro camera is 2MP which capture images correctly only at a distance>/= 4cm and we can't expect a lot from 2MP.\nAs we know ,practically it is not useful in day to day life but can give some good creative satisfaction needed for many users like me.. but most of the users won't use it in reality but is usable.\nSo macro lens is not a deal breaker.\nExcellent!\n\nPerformance +battery efficiency\n\nColor Os is little bit bulky bcos it is feature rich..\nSo i suggest to u to buy 6/8gb variant for being satisfied even in future when games like pubg can increase its size and memory usage.\n\nIam a normal PUBG player who plays classic matches for around 4 - 6/7 hours a day. It never heatsup\nSnapdragon 712 AIE is simply powerful enough for any heavy pubg gamers (smooth+ultra graphics) who also want to use this device as their primary device for calls and internet. Almost no visible frame drops while playing in Bootcamp with lots of squads around\nIf u play pro level just buy Poco F1 (SD 845) at this price \ud83d\ude01\nThere is no need to hesitate!bcos pro gamers require atleast Snapdragon 800+ range chipset.. no need of confusion.\nBut for players who are still on the way to becoming pro. This device is simply great enough for Smooth + ultra graphics game play.\nEven 720g/730g which support extreme settings still need gfx tool to unlock it on budget segement phones..\nSo what's the difference.?\n\nBattery is lasting me enough for pubg + normal heavy usage of other social media apps.\nBut people look at battery drain tests in youtube and may become hungry for more power.. but in reality most people don't use the way youtubers use the phone for extreme tests\ud83c\udf00 U will get what u need on this device.\nI suggest u to go for 8gb variant if u love to have a high end spec at this price range. (I bought 8gb variant just for an extra satisfaction)\n\nAUDIO QUALITY\n\nIt have very loud speakers. But iam not satisfied with the depth of the bass.. it's average .. not much enjoyable\nBut most people use earphones and u get quality bass and treble.. the vocals are clear.\nCall quality is excellent and ur voice is nicely captured by the mic.. it is another problem free area.\n\nOverall Realme 5 pro is a beast with a lot of satisfied practical minded buyers.\nFor spec lovers.. u may dish out lot of money to buy other devices that are great on paper if u want.. but this device is pure VALUE FOR MONEY : )",

If you are not a gaming and only use it for daily use, it will last a day easily.\nFor gaming people, the battery lasts a bit less longer( 30~60mins) but it charges from 0 to 100 in half time. So obviously if you game for hours, this is a better option as for 1 hour of charging cable connected gives you 10~11 hours of gaming while you get ~12 hours of gaming with cable connected for 2~3 hours in other phones at this price such as mi note 7 pro or vivo z series.\n\nMajors cons are related to the color os:\n1. you cannot swipe down anywhere on screen to get notification panel which is super annoying and you cannot change it from stupid google search using settings.\n2. auto adjust brightness is messed up which is again a software problem hopefully they will fix these in next software update.",
