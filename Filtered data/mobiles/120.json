            "Pros:\n1. Supports 13 5G Bands\n2. Has a Dedicated Triple Card slot\n3. Supports WiFi 6 (5.8Ghz)\n4. Has the 3.5mm headphone jack\n5. Has 90Hz Amoled instead of IPS LCD\n6. Runs on modified ColorOS where some Oppo apps are replaced by Google apps. Bloatwares can be uninstalled.\n7. Supports Flash and AI in 64MP mode.\n8. Supports System Cloner where apps can be installed with different sets of credentials.\n9. 65W charging works quite well.\n10. ORoaming supports 5G data.\n11. Phone is NFC certified.\n\nCons:\n1. Photo quality is not great\n2. Display is not bright enough\n3. Although it is ColorOS 12, the Android version is 11, which is an anomaly.\n4. Screen size is quite small, having a big chin.\n5. Macro lens doesn't work well.\n6. Single output speakers, no stereo.\n7. Dual/Clone Apps are not visible using 3rd party launchers.\n8. Phone is suitable as a daily driver but not for gaming or heavy usage.\n9. The color-changing back is just a gimmick.\n\n\nI would recommend this phone only if you need a device that has multi-5G bands + Dedicated SDXC Slot + Ultrawide lens + Punch-hole display (all together).\nElse there are better options available for this price.",
            "Oppo Reno 7 is so good!!! The screen touch is like an iOS phone and the photos are having amazing quality and clarity! You are getting a great RAM + 256 GB in such an attractive price!! Must buy and I am an Oppo user forever!! My last oppo phone was Oppo f11 pro which was super amazing and now this is topping my list!! Go for it guys",
            "Expected better phone since I have even opted for pre-order in anticipation of the specifications mentioned, but it's just average. Totally disappointed. Camera in low light has some lagging and doesn't focus quick enough, needs a better camera performance.lookwise the back panel gradient seems to be normal and nothing fancy. Other low budget phones are coming with better classy back panels.LGI gradient? seriously? Overall performance is decent. Storage is ok, no orbit breathing light in this which is disappointing considering it was not clearly advertised that it comes only with reno 7 pro and not with the basic one..edge lighting is just not fair. Now I don't know how I'm going to manage with this phone for some years, considering there is no return and refund policy available.",
            "Nice camara phone\nDisplay quality is best\nSpeaker is powerful\nLittle bit not satisfied with battery , but fast charging\nOver all best phone in the this range ....\u263a\ufe0f\u263a\ufe0f\u263a\ufe0f",
            "Folks, this phone is Pure AVOID!! writing this review after 2 days of usage. Have been MI / Redmi user for past few years, switched for a better experience (on Hearsay), made a mistake, which others can avoid.\n\nPros:\nCamera is better than my earlier phone rest everything is average / below average.\nFast charging\n\nCons:\nBattery backup is purely HALF DAY not anything more than that.\nPhone missing many features, which other models by competitors in this range even in lower costs handsets are available (e.g. - IR Blaster, which is available is most of the handsets these days)\nPhone comes with Color OS 11, and soon after you set up / personalize the phone comes the OS 12 update \u2013 Loss of time, data and again need to set up the apps\nCall recording feature is missing\nHas only single speaker, while handsets in this price range have dual speakers now days\nDisplay is not bright enough\nNight Mode is useless\nNokia\u2019s feature phone\u2019s Flash Light is brighter than Reno 7 5G flash light\nKeyboard is not smooth\n\n\nCheating \u2013 Flipkart no return policy available",
            "The phone feels outstanding in hands. The camera is the beast in this price segment. 65 watt charger works fantastically but the battery doesn't meet the expectations. It drains fast without any heavy use. Overall the is good....!",
            "I bought it for camera purpose but back camera did nt match any expectations...camera surrounding breathing light should be there in normal varrient also...edge lighting did not work...charging super fast .. performance good ..",
            "Pros\n1. Camera - Rear and front camera gives stunning photos\n2. Storage - 256 GB. Good enough to store songs, photos, videos and download movies.\n3. Battery & Charging - 4500 mah battery. Fast charging, makes life easy with charging completes in less time. Max 35 mints to charge between 10 - 100%.\n4. Performance - All apps open in quick time. No lag found.\n5. Coloros 12 - lots of customisation in UI.\n6. Design - slim and light weight\n\nCons\n1. No FM radio\n2. No IR blaster\n3. Mono speakers / No Stereo speakers - Phone vibrates if set at high volume.\n4. Build quality - Back made of plastic (Reno 7 5G)\n5. Theme store - Not working, most are paid.",

            "Pros:\n1. Supports 13 5G Bands\n2. Has a Dedicated Triple Card slot\n3. Supports WiFi 6 (5.8Ghz)\n4. Has the 3.5mm headphone jack\n5. Has 90Hz Amoled instead of IPS LCD\n6. Runs on modified ColorOS where some Oppo apps are replaced by Google apps. Bloatwares can be uninstalled.\n7. Supports Flash and AI in 64MP mode.\n8. Supports System Cloner where apps can be installed with different sets of credentials.\n9. 65W charging works quite well.\n10. ORoaming supports 5G data.\n11. Phone is NFC certified.\n\nCons:\n1. Photo quality is not great\n2. Display is not bright enough\n3. Although it is ColorOS 12, the Android version is 11, which is an anomaly.\n4. Screen size is quite small, having a big chin.\n5. Macro lens doesn't work well.\n6. Single output speakers, no stereo.\n7. Dual/Clone Apps are not visible using 3rd party launchers.\n8. Phone is suitable as a daily driver but not for gaming or heavy usage.\n9. The color-changing back is just a gimmick.\n\n\nI would recommend this phone only if you need a device that has multi-5G bands + Dedicated SDXC Slot + Ultrawide lens + Punch-hole display (all together).\nElse there are better options available for this price.",

            "Expected better phone since I have even opted for pre-order in anticipation of the specifications mentioned, but it's just average. Totally disappointed. Camera in low light has some lagging and doesn't focus quick enough, needs a better camera performance.lookwise the back panel gradient seems to be normal and nothing fancy. Other low budget phones are coming with better classy back panels.LGI gradient? seriously? Overall performance is decent. Storage is ok, no orbit breathing light in this which is disappointing considering it was not clearly advertised that it comes only with reno 7 pro and not with the basic one..edge lighting is just not fair. Now I don't know how I'm going to manage with this phone for some years, considering there is no return and refund policy available.",

It should provide mediatek dimensity 920 beacause at this price all phones providing this. It also comes with full hd display not FHD+ reno 6 come with FHD+ display.\nAlso camera is simple (Omnivision not Sony). Front camera is performing quite good. Specially portraits. Day to day performance of the phone is good. Battery backup is great and charges fast with supervooc. It comes with a big storage option of 256 gb which is good but it would be better if given UFS 3.1 but it only UFS 2.2.

            "Friends I have used Oppo Reno 7 k for around 10 days. My point wise review is as follows.\n1) Performance is good ..I have not seen any frame drops while playing COD mobile at Max frame rates. Also there is no heating issue.\n2) Battery backup is really good. It gave me approximate 7-8 hrs of screen on time. With the fast charger given in box it charges very fast approx in half an hour.\n3) Back camera is good. It can capture good images. Video stabilisation is ok at 30 FPS full Hd. Front camera is just average for selfies. I would suggest those persons who want a Camera phone to avoid this mobile and go for Samsung for satisfaction.\n4) Display quality is good. There is one bug that in outdoor visibility the light sensor does not work many times and I have to drag it manually to full brightness. Also outdoor visibility is not great. It's peak brightness is slightly on lower side.\n5) Design is ok not very premium. But the device is thin and light weight so very comfortable to use and hold.\n6) There are many bloatware apps. Many apps can be deleted but still some cannot be uninstalled. But it's ok.\n7) My suggestion is if you are getting this mobile in 20k or less than you can think over it.. This oppo reno 7 is surely overpriced at 29 k .",
