            "Thankfully I got this 2 days back was waiting for this variant to be in stock and now I have it, using Motorola for the 1st time and this is pretty good. Overall in this phone I feel & display is superb even in outdoors, camera is pretty decent, stock Android and 60hz refresh rate is also nice, storage is also great, battery works good but would have loved 6000mAH, fast charging is also working nice and yes the features are something unique as am using it for the first time.\nThe phone can be easily used with one hand, very handy and accessible and appropriate in weight. Also I love the Baby Blue colour and the cover with it. Hope this works well for upcoming 3 to 3.5years.",
            "Display is awesome :) in this price range. We get a superb high brightness OLED display. :) And am totally loving it.\nBattery is coming for 2 days for normal usage without gaming.\nCamera, processor is the downside but that's bearable :). Not a big issue. U get clean stock Android experience too.",

There should be more options in the settings to adjust the display colours. The display is not at all colour accurate.For movie watching it is good since the colours are vivid and saturated.\n\nCamera is just ok with stock camera app. Low light camera performance is horrible.\nQuality can be increased drastically using Gcam 8.1.101.\nStock video quality is very bad and it can only shoot 1080p@30fps. Videos lack details and proper autofocus in low light condition.\n\nThere is a way to improve the video quality. 2k video capture can be enabled using Open Camera app. You'll see better sharpness and focus (both front and back@1440p\ud83e\udd2f). The helio g85 chip is capable of recording 1440p videos @30fps. Since Camera2 api is enabled out of the box, Open Camera is able to unlock this higher resolution shooting feature. Select Camera2 api in open camera 'Camera API settings', set the noise reduction algorithm to 'minimal' and edge mode algorithm to 'high' in processing settings, set the video resolution to 2560\u00d71440 and you will be shocked by the results.\n\nBattery backup is excellent. I'm getting around 9~11 hrs screen on time with normal indoor usage.\nNo heating issues.\nCharging is very slow.\nThe phone is light weight and has a very good grip.\n\nReducing 1 star because of the YELLOW TINT issue and poor stock camera app.",

I had set them very low and as a result the experience has been wonderful. Quickly breaking this into pros and cons:\nPros:\n1. Display is really nice.\n2. Battery is good for a moderate user. I usually end my day with 50% remaining.\n3. Comes with a charger.\n4. 3.5mm jack available.\n5. Pure stock Android 11 and all its native features - snappy (for the most part), fluid, polished and easy on the eyes. This actually makes me wish more flagship devices came with stock Android OS.\n6. Moto Gestures are useful.\n\nCons:\n1. Lack of color options for the model.\n2. Takes time to charge due to big size of battery and small charger.\n3. Apps take time to load and stutter sometimes. This is mostly because of the eMMC storage provided.\n4. Still waiting on Android 12 update (hopefully it gets it soon).\n\nThe experience has quickly grown on me and I have come to enjoy using pure Android in the recent weeks. This phone is great value for money! Recommended without any second thoughts.",
