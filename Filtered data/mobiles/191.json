            "Let me be quick in writing all the goods and bads I felt about this cell phone.\nSound is very good, quiet loud, the speakers are of very decent quality.\nDisplay is fine.\nRear Camera is good, produces decent pictures in daylight but there is some softness in the low light mode. Front camera also performs good in daylight mode....but in low light, it struggles to produce a decent picture. Camera AI is not up to the mark. It needs some upgradation.\nThe cell phone feels a bit heavy to me.\nNo bloatwares.\nDoes not come with any backcover.\nCharging is very quick as it comes with a 20W Type C charger.\nFace unlock is quick but I would not recomend you to use the face unlock as it unlocks even if your eyes are closed. Hence, anyone can easily unlock your phone while you are asleep.\nFingerprint sensor is good. Works fine.\nThis phone is not meant for high end gaming, so avoid this if you r a gamer.\n\nOverall, at this price range, I personally feel that the phone is worth buying. Actually, I was bit confused whether to buy Samsung M12 or Moto G10 Power, as both comes with almost same specifications. I chose Moto and I don't regret buying it.",
            "The phone is no doubt best in this budget if you want to experience pure stock android . Earlier I was thinking to buy poco / Xiaomi smartphone (at the time of purchase I was using redmi 4 ) but then somewhere in my heart I wanted to get out of that buggy bloated MIUI with so many ads (as a Xiaomi user myself ) . I have used Motorola smartphones before I got redmi 4 , so I thought to again buy a Motorola smartphone and I'm happy to say that it was the best choice.\n\nI don't regret my decision at all.\n\n1.It's camera is perfect according to this budget.\n2. Absolutely loved it's back design although it is plastic but it comes with Matt finish due to which it doesn't catchs any fingerprints and smudges which is a good thing and it also feels premium.\n\n3. Amazing battery life , in my usage it easily lasts for 2 days maybe more than that and I am a average user.\n\n5. Speaker are decently loud.\n\nAnd yes I forgot to mention Motorola gestures . These were another reason why I purchased Motorola g10 power.\nThey are so much helpful.\n\nI love this purchase .\n\nI am writing this review after using this smartphone for more than 20 days.",
            "I got the phone on 18th of March and delivery is quiet decent\nComing towards phone review\n\n1. Battery is long lasting and for normal users it lasts long upto 2 days without charge but if you are heavy user like me then you can get disappointed.\n2. Camera rear and front both not really upto specially front camera so I''m disappointed but rear one is still good clicks decent pictures.\n3. Processor is also quiet powerful as I am game lover and played free fire it's very smooth going and handles multitasking without lagging also does not heat despite such heavy usage.\n4. Software is pure also not like other phones using their unnecessary UI for some rubbish reason\n5. Lastly as I'm a moto user so kept this legacy carry forward got disappointed with camera but Its a quiet satisfying deal.\n6.Sometimes some apps crashes.\n7.Rating 4/5.\n\nHope the information is worthful for you guys.",

Very bad camera image quality wont at all feel like 48mp camera, even selfie camera image is poor.\n\n2. Display is of poor quality. Brightness levels in outdoor conditions not upto the mark.\n\n3. Processor is very old, only able to manage light daily activities, not at all for gaming or heavy tasks.\n\n4. Very bulky & thick mobile , will feel like mobile of 2015 or so in terms of its thickness & weight.\n\n5.No dedicated memory card slot.\n\nPros:\n1. Very good battery back up. Easily 2 days backup on moderate usage.\n\n2. Very close to stock android exp.\n\nThus, concluding dont buy this mobile.",

It have also fast charging which generally takes 2 Hr and 50 minutes to charge from 0 to 100%.\nI have complaint about delivery boy who delivered one day after the expected day of delivery.\nBut overall phone is fantastic. Rear Camera is also very good , when use 48 Mp. Front camera is below average. Processor is also average.\nDisplay is also great",

            "I purchased it for my dad. I was not sure about the performance before. I went through some reviews and I was convinced that the phone is okay for light users. I was more convinced with its build quality and 6000 mah battery. After receiving the phone, thanks to flipkart for 1 day delivery my dad stated using it. After few day I asked my dad about the phone and I was quite satisfied to hear that he is very happy with the phone. Stock android experience with smooth and good performance. The built quality is really good and single full charge lasts upto 2 days. My dad uses it mostly for watching web series and movies. No lag or heating issues. Awesome overall. I would strongly recommend it.",
            "Most of its features as well as performance of the phone are good, except for the display. People looking for value for money, good performance, great battery life, fast charging, decent sound, etc. then this is a good buy. However, if you are someone looking for a good display or camera this will disappoint you. The brightness level of this phone at 80% is same as the brightness level of 30% in most other phones. Color contrast is very poor too. I am not comparing it with AMOLED displays, I am merely comparing it with TFT displays of other phones.",
            "Nice phone liked it i charged full then the phone had 10% after 3days by using phone also . It is a nice buy",
            "I think this is best option to someone they have regular Use.\n\nBattery last upto 15 hr of continues normal use. You can watch upto 4 films.\n\nCamera is better , some one commented that bad camera, but note right. If you take a picture and view it on a laptop or PC It look similar on your phone. But some phones have some enhancement that make photo great ,but really they are bad( on a laptop or PC). But in this phone no enhancement added ,that's good because we see exactly same picture. Camera experience depends on display enhancement also...\n\nNeed to change some settings in camera app to take good picture with 48MP quad pixel.\n\nFront camera is not expected, but fine.\n\nIn my opinion this is phone have descent camera.\n\n\nDisplay quality good , but not better . Need to include some enhancement to look great. It may fix in updates. If they fix this camera experience also become better.\n\n\nIn performance , normal multi tasking is good. But not better multi tasking while gaming because of only 4 gb ram.\nSo If you need to gaming, just do gaming only with limited multi tasking. Otherwise you feel bad gaming experience. I played COD and Asphalt and some other games, all of them work good.( don't do multi tasking while gaming.)\nWithout gaming multi tasking is good.\n\n\nBuilt-in quality also good compared to other phones within this price range.\n\n\nAfter all it is a midrange phone under 10k, In this range this is a better option.",
            "Writing this review after one week use\nMobile is little heavy in weight\nBattery not that much good (in full charge I can use only the one day I expect at least two days backup for 6000 mah)\nFront camera quality is very poor\nMain camera is average\nIn look is good\nPerformance is also good\nIf you searching decent device in low budget then only go for it otherwise wise if you can spend little more 3000 4000 k the you have better choice.. thanks",
            "I am writting this review after usage of 10 days..\n\nPros\n1. Excellent battery back up. For heavy usage also it lasts for two days.\n2. Excellent design. The build quality is awesome at this price range. The phone looks premium in hands.\n3. Good body to screen ratio.\n4. Decent rear cameras. Excellent at this price point.\n5. Stock Android experience is awesome. No much gui related permission, all permissions are related to direct Google services and applications.phone is clean.\n5. Dedicated security folder to protect our important data's.\n6. Think shield security platform.\n7. Ip 62 splash proof rating at this price segment\n\nCons.\n1. Display is pretty only the backlight brightness we need to keep at 70% ( it is not a big concern). At this brightness settings display is pretty good.",
            "The phone is good for normal usage. It is okay for the people doesn't consume too much of online content, videos as the display is not that best. The camera is not great at all even it is 48MP on paper. However from budget point of view it is good. The good things of this phone are that it is stock android/clean ui, good battery life, speakers. Performance is good on this phone but might not be best for heavy gaming.\n\nI am bit disappointed with the camera and the display. It could have been a bit better than what it is.",
            "very good product, Over all performance is good , good camera , But need of update,\nits used to stop using net after some time .",

            "Nice phone in this price range. There is no lag or bugs in UI. Smooth day to day performance. Battery is superb it will take 2 days to 0%. Camera is good in day light conditon. In low light little bit noise observed in photo. If you purchasing mobile for day to day life and for camera then it's the superb device. Design is nice. Plastic body looks sturdy. I am not done any gamming or high uses apps till the date but I am sure it will give a smooth performance",
            "Pros:\n- Excellent value for money\n- Fairly good for everyday normal use\n- Battery lasts 2 days\n- Pure Android, no bloatware/ads\n\nCons:\n- 720p screen\n- Heavy\n- Spotty vp9 codec support, some videos on YouTube won't play at 1080P (instead only at 480P)\n- No compass (magnetometer sensor absent)",
            "Superb battery backup, could easily last for 2 or 3 days on a single charge for normal users. Camera not upto the mark, multimedia is ok as it would have been better it they had provided 1080p resolution instead of 720p. In this price point can't expect amoled screen but i personally love amoled than ips lcd display. battery backup and stock android are the key features of this smartphone. A movie of 2 and half hours without skipping consume only 4% of battery. Terrific battery beast.",
            "Though the phone is quite good at this price range with stock android and a 20W fast charger bundled with it.\nPros\nNice Display\nFast Charging\nMoto Inbuilt features and nice ram management.\n\nCons -\nThere are minor issues and glitches in the camera but I hope moto will provide a software update to resolve them.\n\nRest the device is good performer at this price point.",
            "Best in segment thanks moto for thinkshield & stock android those are very important for phones security. Rear camera is best but front is not up to the mark. Battery is full powerful",
            "This is my first Pure Android Mobile. I'm happy that I can remove unwanted applications from mobile and it's about 50GB user space out of 64GB after Software upgrade as soon as we complete booting/google account setup. But on non-stock android, we will get around 46GB only. so, Pure Android is the winner clearly.\nPhone display is average as mentioned by many users. But, as a normal user, I use for occasional online classes (my kid), social networking, few photos, and mainly using applications to avail easy access (to avoid going out to pay EB, Book Gas, Whatsapp, Recharges, Online Shopping) everything we do during Pandemic. I don't like play Mobile Games.\nSo, If you expect something in this usage list, You can very well go for this mobile. it's 220gm mobile but still ok (as most of the mobiles are in 200gm range only)",
            "Writing this review after 2 weeks of usage.\n\nPros:\n*Excellent battery backup (for normal usage it stays up to 3 days)\n*Display quality is good. Worth for money\n*Sound clarity is good and decent\n*With 4GB of RAM performance is excellent\n*Latest Android version with smooth functionality\n\n\nCons:\n*Even though the camera capacity is 48mgp, picture and video quality is low.\n*Charging of 6000MAH battery with 20w charger takes time. Could have provided changer with higher watts.\n*It's a heavy weight phone due to the high battery capacity.\n\nOver all, worth for money when you are ready to compromise with the normal camera quality and phone weight.",
            "Great battery performance . Nice Camera , both rear and front . Fingerprint sensor works superbly but face recognisation is very slow . Screen recording feature is nice.",
            "For daily usage I bought this phone as it delivers what it promises. Dont compare with 10K+ mobiles, but under 10K this is one of top 5.\n\nYou don't have option to change the navigation buttons in the bar(Its handy with left hand for back button) or you need to use gesture.\nPictures are good as expected. For more sound need a sound enhancer, brightness also need to improve.\n\nIF YOU ARE NOT INTERESTED IN GAMES AND USING SOFTLY, THEN THIS MODEL IS VERY RECOMMENDABLE.",
            "Not user-friendly touch display is not working good\nBattery performance is not satisfactory some popular function like gallery , converter , etc camera performance not good and user friendly overall purchasing \"Moto g 10\" is not good decision.",
            "The few days I used and here are my thoughts - think the phone is great for the price I paid,\nBattery is superb it'll last 2 days guaranteed on average use and still have juice left\nNetwork and connectivity is also good\nLatest OS is Banzai !!\nBut the downside is the phone is too thick\nCamera is not satisfactory I didn't buy for camera anyway\nMoto should really provide a different slot for memory card instead of multifunction slot.\nHappy with the purchase for now",
            "Mobile is good performance but display I don't like if we adjust more than 50% then only display appearance ok, if below 50% you can't see visual in display. Motorola need to improve display quality",
            "It's out standing phone as per Amount value under this amount is ph is very good Display is very good camera quality is out standing and battery back up is excellent Need to buy this product if your budget is under 8k",
            "It's awesome.. Display is good with good brightness. The camera is too good for this price. Battery is humongous. The best part is the weight distribution. You will not feel that heavy when holding in hand.\nGo for it.",
            "Not recommended for Heavy users and Multitaskers. Battery is the main selling point of this cellphone. And I like it's stock android. Camera is ok, processor is ok, though it lags sometimes. Moto gestures are great. Cellphone body is robust.\n\nIf you are not a heavy user then this phone will be great for you.",
            "Battery - That 6000 mAh brick is just gold for backup. I bought it for my father and it's his first smartphone. The battery drained from 100% to 60% in 3 days on minimal usage. Data was turned off. He mostly uses it for voice calling. Standby backup is also very good which is a plus.\n\nScreen- It's HD+. It would have been better if it was FHD+. Screen quality is not that good but it's okay for a HD+ screen. Quality could have been better.\n\nSoftware- Stock android is pure gold. It's clean with all necessary functions without any crap. For my father, it's best.\n\nCamera- Real camera is okay if not very good for this price range but front camera is just crap. Front camera clicks worst shot in this price range.\n\nProcessor- SD480 handles all the day-to-day tasks easily while also being power efficient.\n\nWeight and Form Factor- Weight is about 220g which is little heavy but it's mainly due to that 6000 mAh brick. Form factor is also good.\n\nConclusion- This phone is made for old age people who need a clean UI and great software experience with decent enough battery backup. It's not for gaming or photoholic people. It can be used for online classes thanks to its 6000 mAh brick.",
            "I am little bit not satisfied with the camera but the overall performance of the phone is quite good.\nEspecial mention about the battery, on normal usage (call, whatsapp, YouTube) the phone runs for around 72hours. Refresh rate is good and performance of Snapdragon processor 732G is very good.",
            "Practical Phone\n\n\nBasics of this phone are done right.\n\n- Good speakers (both loudspeaker and earpiece)\n- Great battery and fast charger\n- Good call clarity, proximity sensor works properly\n- Solid build\n- Clean UI free from junk, spywares and ads\n- Overall very decent smartphone experience\n- Perfect for the budget oriented and for the elderly",

Over all phone is worth buying. Go for it.",

            "Rear camera is great during day and night and to click photos in 48 MP which will give 8000 by 6000 dimensions depending on details ranging from 9 MB to 25 MB or may be more but you can actually click in 48 MP, for that go to photo in bottom then to settings and then to ratio in which select 3:4 High Resolution and in resolution select High Resolution. Front camera day photos are great but night ones are average. Not an issue. Apart from this, it has solid build quality, IP 52 rating, pure Android, dual WIFI with 2\u00d72 MIMO, 20 W charger and ofcourse 6000 mAh battery. Snapdragon 460 is actually good..",
            "Superb phone for a decent price. Awesome for basic level android smartphone. SD 460 wont help you in high end gaming and other applications but excellent for day to day job.

            "A very good budget phone. It has a stock Android 11, OTG, wifi hotspot and USB tethering which I find very useful. The camera is reasonable for normal use. It has a type C USB port for charging. The battery is 6000mah which is very great! It lasts a long time and there is no need to check very often if charge has fallen! Overall, it is a great buy.",
            "good phone. fast delivery! im rly satisfied w my purchase. it kind of heats up when it's charging but it has zero issues so far on anything else. it's a bit heavy as expected but nothing 2 worry about. well worth the money.",

            "Good budget phone. Good for day today activities. Cannot handle games though, Gets heated, Display colors are ok, Camera is worst, If 2 sim cards are used it lags, performs better with 1 simcard. Overall budget device cannot expect much.",
            "This is a great phone with all the required specs. Battery is huge, lasting for more than 2 days on normal usage. But this phone is not for high end gaming use, Android 11 is a great advantage and stock android is flawless experience, very clean. Would recommend anyone to buy this phone at a great price of less than 10k. Camera is just good, cannot be compared to other phones.",
            "Using it it's a good smart phone. Happy to use it. This phone has Android 11 and some new features. Which is very helpful...\nOnly drawback is You can use only one sim + one SD Card or only 2 Sim Card without SD Card...",

I am getting around 12 hrs. of screen time and don't need to charge for two days with excessive usage and three days with normal usage.\n2.Design and weight balance is done very well, doesn't feel like you are holding a brick (as MI/ Poco phones does), despite the fact it has 6000 mAH battery.\n3. Clean software near stock android experience, software is so clean that its a sigh of relief after switching back to it from MIUI. (earlier had POCO M3).\n4. Android 11 OOB+ Moto gestures are very handful.\n5. Audio Output is quite balanced even if its not a stereo speaker.\n6. Night mode is doing a decent job.\n\nCons:\n1. Front Camera quality isn't unto the mark, photos are too soft.\n2. Screen resolution is only 720p and not Full HD, but I guess its the main reason for such a great battery backup.\n3. Phone case isn't provided in the box.\n\n\nOverall its cons are just rebalancing kind of decisions and not Cons. Hope front Camera issue will be fixed with an update.\nThis phone is not suitable for people inclined towards on paper specifications but for the people who are more inclined towards in hand experience and user experience.\nI bought this phone as a last resort after my POCO M3 betrayed me with buggy MIUI 12.0.7 I swear I will never buy a phone with MIUI again.",
            "Phone is bit heavy due to mass battery.\nDisplay works good indoor but it lacks its capacity when sun shines bright on your mobile.\nCamera is one of the aspect that needs better wiring... rear one clicks decent picture during the day but Front one works like 2MP...\nPerformance is good....\n\nOverall Phone is good for those who loves stock android.... Best in the budget.....",

Best battery backup having real 6000 mAh battery,\n2. Smooth and fast performance,\n3. Nice stock android experience,\n4. Better rear camera quality,\n5. Best front camera quality,\n6. Interesting Moto gestures,\n7. Best fingerprint scanner,\n8. Strong 2*2 MIMO technology,\n9. True water repellent capacity,\n10. Strongest built quality.\nAnd\nAccording to my opinion only one little but problem is of heavy weight. (But after handling some days, the problem of heavy weight becomes negligible)\nFriends, I am using smartphone as a daily normal use, I am not performing any type of game on mobile, so I have not given review about gaming.

But the battery doesn't drain out faster. So HEATING ISSUE with the phone only\n\nThirdly, the LED DOT (LIGHT) IS MISSING as usual. So for notifications there is no led beeper plus while charging there is no way to find out if you screen is off. You have to light the screen and peep into the battery to understand if its charging or not.\n\nSound is good enough but preloaded ringtones are trash.",

I've had pleasant user experience therefore I stuck to Motorola.\nThe Motog10 bought in mid March 2021 is an extremely stubborn, user unfriendly piece of equipment. It deliberately keeps switching to the sim data although full, strong Wifi is present while at my home and office. Even if I switch off the sim data in WiFi zone, it just refuses to connect to the WiFi. The phone prefers NOT to function the apps in the absence of sim data being ON. I use my old Motog5s on another sim card in the same conditions mentioned above. The fact that the Motog5s functions normally is testimony enough that the Motog10 is by far behaving very, very stubbornly!\nAnother major shortcoming in the Motog10 is the alarming rate at which it dials the Emergency Number (somedays 10-15 times daily!). This happens when you sense your finger on sensor reader as well as when one manually depress the display on/off button. I truly didn't expect such a miserable, stubborn product from Motorola and regret very much my decision to continue with their products.",

I have an Anti-Samsung and Anti-Chinese brand (originally) agenda in me, that\u2019s why I don\u2019t like those. Now, Motorola has its origin in US, later it was sold to Google and after that, to Lenovo. However, this phone is manufactured in India and mainly for Indian market only, so I made my mind to bought it, finding no better option from Nokia. Now talking about Flipkart, I ordered this phone at 9PM at night and it arrived next day at 2PM, however it was to be delivered in 3 days time. So\u2026 Thank you Flipkart!",
