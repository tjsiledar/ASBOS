            "Surprising Performance and Worth the Price. Better than Samsung M/F series / Redmi . The Device looks way premium than the Price. Gave it as a gift to Mom.Build quality is no doubt Motorola's one of then top pros.\n\nthe New Unisoc t700 chipset performs way better than nearby Snapdragons at this price range. No lagging on heavy Usage. Its been 3 weeks and the Processor Optimisation is up to the mark.\n\nCamera as expected they are Okayish. Personally a not camera geek so did not except top camera at this Price range. But the Pictures turn out fine.\n\nBattery is Huge , probably one of the reason for slight increase in weight. Althought battery performance is good.but there are a lot of scopes to improve with gradual updates.\n\nScreen HD+ Is totally good , cannot except anything more at this compromised price. Sound speakers are bit Off loud. But not bad.\n\nLast but Not least Almost Pure android stock. So recommended a lot for smooth usage.\n\nAfter Using other brands at this Price range From samsung , realmi, mi. Moto e40 Performed ahead of all. Totally worth.",
            "Performance is ok, screen is very good, camera is below standard. Have installed another camera app which works better than stock so that's ok. Rest overall is good",
            "After one month of usage i feel this UNISOC is better options than SD&exyno if ur not serious gamer.\nGood Performance, asphalt game working good.\nCamera is good for me, as I am not a photographer.\nSound good seems to be powerful and very loud.\nDisplay very nice, touch working well.\n4GB ram enough for normal uses.\nYES charger is very slow, 2hr for 100%.\nCharging not compatible with samsung charger\nBest thing stock android, so u don't get any bloatware.\nOverall it's most durable under 10k.\nScreen guard only available online.\nBack cover already in the box and it's realy good quality\nAnd ofcourse it's name Motorola enough for reliability",
            "Very good product. It's been only one day , but it looks very good with battery and cameras. With this price , it the best\nAfter 2 month-\nThis is best product, battery is powerful, camera clearity is best. With this price it is beat. Motorola is great.",
            "Overall good phone for this budget range. Stock Android is good. Battery is best part of it. But the camera is not upto the mark. It feels like 8 or 13 MP camera. If you are not a camera lover and use camera casually, have budget under 10k then go for it",
            "I am writing the review after 40 days of usage.\n1. Good build quality(Motorola is known for its excellent build quality).\n2. Initially, the caller's complaint of echo in the voice calling but sorted out after help from the Motorola service centre.\n3. Camera quality is average (The rear camera is somewhat ok but the front camera is not up to the mark).\n4. Speakers are sufficiently loud so that you can enjoy your videos.\n5. Talking about the processor, it provides smooth performance.\n6. wifi connectivity is only for 2.4GHz if it has 5GHz, It would be better.\n7. Display colours are sufficiently bright\n8. Battery charging is prolonged; it takes 2.5-3 hrs to charge it fully (10W charging supported only).\nLastly, I would like to say if you want a budget phone, then go for it.",

            "I think this the best ph to buy. Bcz this is not like mi or realme it is a clean UI so u can enjoy its seamless performance... Though cam is a little downgrade but battery performance and smoothness makes it best ph under 10k.",
            "I complete 6 month with this Device....\ud83d\ude04\nIt's it's it's just Superb ....\n\nReally value for money product.\ud83d\udc4c\nAny one really want a good quality budget smart device under 10k,then blindly choose it (motorolla e40)\ud83d\udc4d\n\nIn 10k budget range large of phone available in market..\nBut Don't forget Moto Is a Brand one ..No one give this type of processor like Moto.. (G70, G80 - G85 processor give under 14k price range) but moto give as far as better processor in 10k. \ud83d\udc4d\n\nNo lag , awesome battery backup, quality display,\n\nlittle bit unsatisfied with camera quality but not so bad really in this budget range... Decent quality camera,but awesome picture taking at day time....\n\nThank you Motorolla\nThank you Flipkart",
            "Given the price point of this phone, moto has done a great job in making this phone. This is a wonderful phone for the given price point. If you compare it with phones in the higher price segment (i.e. 15 - 20K) then for sure you will notice difference hence if you are on a budget then this is a very good phone for a budget buyer.",
            "Bought this phone for my mom. Writing this review after 3days of usage. Overall this is a great value for money product. The camera works good in outdoor or in good lighting conditions but same cannot be said for low lighting. Just because it has more mega pixels means you'll get a great camera.. coming to display the 90hz screen is smooth, by default it's on auto you can change it in settings. The ips display is good not that bright though... Only when u keep the brightness to max it get brighter but no issues using outside in bright sunlight conditions.. there no lag or anything i even installed pubg and it ran without any issues... The battery life is great since you get 5000mah.. takes quite a while to get charged as you get only 10w charger and the speakers are not that loud, and sometimes it feels like the sound output is not clean but you should also keep in mind the price of the phone before u judge anything... Overall a great product my mom likes it and im happy with my purchase",
            "Nice product \ud83d\ude0d I loved it . After using 4 month my experience is pretty good . I like the battery the most .\nCamera is awesome. Sound is blockbuster.",
