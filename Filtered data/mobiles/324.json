            "As a feature phone the product is fantastic. Light weight, good battery back up (though it is too early to comment).\nBut the problem I felt is that the font size of the display is very small as I have bought this phone for my elderly mother and she is unable to read the contact details at times. When calling someone the display shows phone numbers only. Contact name is shown in very small font size at the bottom of the small display which is pretty inconvenient for elderly person like my mother. You can't customize the font size nor the Black colour background.\nThough this will not be an issue for young or middle aged users. Hope Nokia will definitely bring some changes in the software to make it more user friendly for elderly people as in our country aged people prefer these phones.\nOverall good product.",
