            "I got the product at my door step in 16 hours after ordering so thank you flipkart for this excellent delivery. I have used it for 3 days and now writing my review:\nPro:\n1. Battery is brilliant and perfect for people who spent lot of time on multimedia\n2. Display 90hrz is very smooth and good looking. Didn't feel the absence of Full HD actually better than full HD IPS displays.\n3. Samsung One UI\n4. Look & feel. Very comfortable to hold. Background Matt finish no fingerprint\n5. Primary camera is good if not great for this price.\nI am adding some samples. Front camera is also very good.\n6. No heating problem even after heavy gaming. G80 optimization is better than expected.\n\nCons:\n1. No 4k video support. EIS is not upto the mark in video recording\n2. This phone is not for people who likes to play big games\n\nI will say I am in a winning situation after the purchase of the phone based on the price. According to my needs it's comfortable, nice display, good camera and fantastic battery. If these are your requirements then go for it. You will not be disappointed.",

Camera is not give.a brighter selfie ...but good for boys .\ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02. .... But for the girls it can be Some less good for selfie . Because its selfie is not click with make your face beautiful \ud83d\ude00 .but not bad its good ..you can add filters from editing option ......\nThats all ......this phone is very nice ......\nYou can purchase this phone \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udcf1\ud83d\udcf1",

Phone performance is pretty good. Front camera \ud83d\udcf7 is only average. Can opt this out if battery life and display quality only matters for some standard budget branded phone.",
            "Best product\nMy detailed review\npros\n1)Amoled display is best\n2)smooth because of refresh rate\n3)optimized software and permission management\n4)back camera is very good......photos did not grain even with 10x zoom.\n5)Many useful features like qr scanner,samsung notes are there.....even you are getting samsung pay mini\n6)Oneui 3 is far better than miui.......in case of optimization,customization and cleanliness......means ads do not bother you much.\n7)best audio quality on earphone with dolby atmos\ncons\n1)front camera is worst......it is missing saturation and photos in low light grain even on slightly zoom\n2)samsung ultra data saving does not work fully though it is present......data saving does not work\n3)net speed is too low as it does not support data aggregation\n4)sometimes lags even with less memory process\n5)mediatek helio g80 has lower antutu benchmark score......so if you want for hardcore gaming..... don't go for it.\n6)audio quality could be loud.......\n7)pixels are visible as it has lower pixel density......but youtube video in full hd runs like butter and there is almost no buffering at all........\nIf you are planning to buy mobile for daily use and multimedia......this is a good choice to consider.....but if you are tech geek and player go for moto g40 as it has snapdragon 732.......\nLeast but last like my review if useful",
            "Very nice phone, has awesome camera quality.\nI m totally impressed. Battery backup is great.\nBut it comes with many inbuilt apps, so it occupies around 10GB of storage..\nOverall nice mobile at this price range \ud83d\udc4d",
            "Good display, battery good, camera ok for price. but if u r claiming as 48 mp then came should be good. Flipkart packing should improve no bubble wrap? Overall good buy.",

I have already used J8 of Samsung which was better as compared to f22 for fingerprint. Battery back up is decent. It will provide a full day battery back up if you do web surfing. I am not a pubg or other game user. So I can't tell about how it works when u play games. Display is good but touch screen is not that good specially when you want to receive a call touchscreen doesn't perform well. You have to swipe at least 2 times and put pressure to take the call. During the call there is no problem regarding volume or quality of call. Charging is not so fast. I did not feel any heating issue till now. No issue regarding mobile network. The worst part of the mobile is during the call , the sensor doesn't works well. Screen becomes active and screen light gets on.Within a month the phone starts to hang and worst experience is during a call all the touch became non active or dead. Then I had to restart the phone by pressing the power button and volume low button together for 15 to 20 seconds. I will give a 0.5 out of 5 for this mobile.",

I use the mobile around 8 to 10 hrs a day,Battery first 2 months were better,now slightly less, definitely not to the same Mark of Motorola mobile which I used before it.\n\nCons:\n1. It has less capacity of networking,like we are using two different companies's handset at the same place with same network provider, but f22 captures less speed,even network is getting disconnected each day regularly while MI working better\n2. Battery capacity though showing 6000 mA but a 5000ma battery of Motorola is far better.\n3.

It's hardly audible in a moderately noisy environment.\n2) Camera - Don't get this phone for the camera. Both front and back camera - Not good.\n3) Wifi Calling - Lot of disturbance in the call. I turned off the wifi calling.\n4) AOD (Always on Display) - AOD is available but there is no option to increase the brightness.

The HD+ super amoled display on this phone doesn't look bad though... yes, the pixel density is less and it can be seen but the colours and contrast stand out while consuming less battery. I paid 13k for a phone that doesn't support carrier integration and comes with HD resolution only but the user experience is surprisingly good so far. The phone is lightweight, OneUI has beautiful customisation options, camera is good, audio output on my headphone is clean and loud. I don't play games on my phone, so the performance is satisfactory even with the mediatek g80. This phone comes with Knox security and the interface feels well thought out and polished.",

So heating is not an issue in my opinion.\n\n6.SOUND QUALITY:- My previous phone has dual full time Dolby Atmos speakers so if comparing with that phone speakers are decent.\n\n7.CHARGING:- I think Samsung should write 20W on charger because is too fast for what they call it 15W.Charging Speed Surprised me.\n\n8.COLOUR :- I ordered a black color phone but I received the phone in the sort of greenish color although it looks like black but it is not exactly black.\n\n*OVERALL EXPERIENCE*\nMy Overall Experience with this phone is great so far just wish the camera could have been a little better(it's not bad either) else everything is great.\nAlso some people might miss notification light \ud83d\ude00\n\nThis Phone is far better than Chinese Rebranded Phones\n\nThis is my review of this phone hope it will help you.",
