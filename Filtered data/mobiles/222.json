            "From the start it was unable to make or receive calls properly, requiring multiple attempts by the caller. On receiving the call the sound quality is so poor that you can barely understand even 50% of what is being said. The so-called 'music feature' side easy volume control just means that the ringer volume turns off in your bag. The memory is insufficient to perform most of the mobiles standard tasks. The message app can only hold a very few messages before you have to delete them. So all this and other insufficiencies I don't know why this phone had any good ratings. Now af5er about 2months, the buttons. Intermittently stop working. It won't turn on unless plugged in. When a call comes, it's silent and pressing the answer button does nothing. So completely useless really, and yet so expensive.-terrible. it's nearly even a phone. DONT BUY IT, YOULL REGRET IT. ANY REVIEWS OVER 1STAR ARE OBVIOUSLY FAKE.",
