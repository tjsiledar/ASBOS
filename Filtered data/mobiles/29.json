Camera is also good but for clear picture we have to use 64 mp camera only which gives me a dslr photography like feeling\n6. Quick charging and battery backup is also good after use for 3 to 4 hours my battery consumption is as follows : 92% to 84% after use for 4 hours\n\nThis is my review after a half day of use may be give another review after 1 month of use\n\n\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a",
            "Received the phone today. Thanks to Flipkart was super fast delivery. Ordered the yellow colour for my mom because it appeared classy. Inside the box, we had the phone, adaptor, case and original bill. Well, i have two things to say. Yes, the handset actually looks good to the eyes and feels premium in hand. Battery is very good. I could see the phone charging up to 100% within 30 minutes and i used the phone throughout the day and it's still on 51%.\n\nCamera is Decent enough to make you capture good clicks. Performance is fast. Yes, there are bugs . There are many pre installed applications that i uninstalled so that took time. Super Amoled screen really works good.\n\nOverall, i feel this is really a nice phone for me. However, i do feel this is, if not much, overpriced by 2-3K rupees. The price was more justified if POCO offered Snapdragon 775g processor and not Android 11. That's just my own point of view though. Rest is fine. No idea about gaming because that's not why i brought it for.\n\nOverall, a 4/5 i would say.",

When we click with rear camera, it will first blur everything then will take another half minute to detect the subject and unblur it. Even after a minute, It is unable to blur the background. It will blur the subject too. Low light photo is just useles. VGA camera will click better photos. Needs a major fix. They launched this in hurry to compete with realme 9 pro and it turns out to be a big failure. It looks nice though. When tried to return the product, first they didn't respond. When i intimidated them, customer care guy called personally to abuse me. Wow.",
