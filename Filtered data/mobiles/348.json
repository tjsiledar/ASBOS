            "What a phone is this more from my expectations great phone Given the obsession of the smartphone world with the 18:9 aspect ratio of the display Xiaomi too has incorporated this for the Redmi 5 Pro. But this isn\u2019t the first Xiaomi phone to come with a bezel-less design in India as it had introduced this feature with its flagship device the Mi Mix 2 last year. However, with the Redmi 5 Pro, now it won\u2019t burn a hole in your pocket. Due to the bigger display, the capacitive keys are now on-screen keys.\nThe front is as usual dominated by the display along with the selfie camera, earpiece and the usual array of sensors on the top edge, with a layer of 2.5D Corning Gorilla Glass on the top with rounded display corners. The curves make the phone easy to hold and facilitate smooth operation, despite sporting a 5.99-inch screen size.Turn the smartphone around and you will first see a vertically placed iPhone X like rear camera setup, where the LED flash is housed in between the two lenses. Frankly, this is not the first time when an Apple design feature has made its way to other smartphones. Remember when the dual rear camera setup of the iPhone 7 Plus was unveiled, how many handset makers got \"inspired\" by the design?\nMoving on, the back panel also has a centrally placed fingerprint sensor and the Mi branding below it. The handset comes with a micro-USB charging port (we fail to understand why) that is placed at the bottom, along with 3.5mm audio jack and the mono speaker. There's a volume rocker and power button on the right, while the left side has a SIM card tray. The top of smartphone has the IR blaster that lets it control devices such as a TV.\nComing to the display, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 has a 5.99-inch screen with a FHD+ resolution of 2160x1080p. The display comes with features such as Reading mode, which reduces the blue light emissions; Schedule that lets you customize the period of this reading mode; Contrast and colour selection and text size options. The images were quite sharp and we did not see any pixelization. The sunlight legibility is not one of the best suits of the device and we also felt the display looks slightly dimmer, when viewed from a certain angle.\nOverall, we can say we did not have any complaints with the slim body design and is definitely going to grab some attention, even if it\u2019s just for the rear camera panel.\nPerformance and camera\nLet\u2019s talk about the specs of the device as it comes with a noteworthy feature. Debuting along with the Xiaomi Redmi 5 Pro is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 processor, making it the first smartphone in the world to be powered by it. This new chipset features the newest Kyro technology, claimed to be seen in the 800-series chipset. Apart from this, the Note 5 Pro has 4GB RAM and 64GB internal storage.\nThe device runs Xiaomi's MIUI 9 skin based on Android 7.1.1 Nougat, and should hopefully receive an Oreo-based update as all major launches of this year now are expected to come with the latest operating system. The MIUI 9, like the typical Xiaomi UI, has no app drawer and therefore all apps are placed on multiple home-screens. It comes with an app lock feature and dual apps space customized theme option. The leftmost home screen comes with quick cards that show the frequently used features and information. It is placed in the form of cards, similar to Today's page in iOS, that show shortcuts, calendar, take a note and more. This can obviously be customized as per the user and comes in quite handy once you start depending on it.\nOne thing that we must point out is that even though the handset has a third-party theme support, these apps are not yet optimized for the 18:9 aspect ratio of the display. There is a blank black patch that comes on the lock screen if you select any app and it surely gets on your nerves after a point. When we asked Xiaomi about this, they said, \"Starting this month, all official themes from Mi India will be adapted to 18:9 aspect ratio. Also, third-party theme developers are being pushed to adopt their themes for 18:9 phones.\"\nIn short, right now you get only two native themes that are fully supporting the display.\nWe ran Antutu and GeekBench 4 tests on our device. While the phone scored 100031 in Antutu Benchmarks, the single-core and multi-core scores on GeekBench 4 were 1772 and 4227 respectively.\nDuring our testing, we found the overall performance of the Xiaomi Note 5 Pro to be simply incredible. The phone handled multi-tasking of random app in a smooth lag-free way. We did not encounter any frame freezing of any kind. Both the call quality and the Audio quality are also quite good. The issue persists with the speaker placed at the bottom as the sound gets muffled when the device is placed in a landscape mode.\nThe Xiaomi Redmi 5 is backed by a 4000mAh battery that easily lasted us for more than a day of average use that included playing games and browsing social media apps, with Wi-Fi turned on.\nIf this review help ful then like\nit",
            "AMAZING BALANCED PHONE - comparing to PRO version(Why i did not bought PRO an)\n1) snapdragon 636 is untested and only 1.8Ghz however 625 is 2 Ghz and widely used in past. That is the reason MI choose that processor for it.\n2) ram beyond 3gb is not needed in any apps or games in current scenario.\n3) I have stopped buying storage space even 16 gb will suffice me. I already have more than 2 tb in PC. Also not a fan of keeping lot of data in phone, it makes it slow.\n4) dual camera effect is rarely needed and can be done easily with softwares\n5) Front camera is used generally for close up pics. Whether its 20MP or 5MP it will be almost same if quality of 5 Mp is clear enough. And this phone clicks good photos from both cameras even in low light.\n6) high PPI + high CPU + gyro = Good for VR Experiance.\n7) 5G is expected in 2019 and 4g phones will be history, so dont buy for long term it will go waster. I consider this phones max life is less than 2 years for me.\n\nMy point is, of course you will get better config in PRO version BUT there is not much practical use of those features. If you dont want to use gyroscope, Redmi 5a will be better choice. Dont even bother note series.",

            "First of all 5* for fk, fast delivery within 24 hrs.\nGreat, keep it up. Now come to mobile, let's see.\n(1) Display is clear & bright with fhd but tall one due to 18 :9 ratio. If you are using for first time it will take some time to adjust it, then afterwards no problem. So 9/10\n(2) Battery is great, 4000 mah is easily last for 2 days with moderate to heavy usage. So 10/10\n(3) Sound is average from speakers, not at all loud. Disappointing, actually it should have dual speakers as cost is 10k. So 7/10\n(4) Camera -- rear one with flash is average, so 8/10. Front one with selfie light ( it's not flash, first you have to on the light & then you have to click selfies ) I think it's useless. So 7/10\n(5) Led notification light is of only single white colour, again disappointing. My previous one redmi 4a have 5 to 6 colours, inspite of have cost of 6k.\n(6) Again hybrid sim slot, though knew before\nbuying but redmi 5a have dedicated sim slot ( cost only 5k ) & note 5 with hybrid ( cost is double ) , didn't understood what's the logic behind it ???\n(7) Fingerprint sensor is fast & accurate, so 9/10\n(8) There is no problem in playing YouTube videos, it's played in full length.\n(9) It should come with latest Android ie. Oreo. But it is with Nougat. Anyway let's see when co. is giving update of Oreo.\n(10) Miui 9 is fast.\nFinally it is good budget device with 5.99\" fhd+ display with some loose point as mentioned above. Anyway co. will never give everything in one device, it's their business strategy. If my review is helpful then pls. press like button. Thanks.",

The screen corners are curved and had very thin side bezels that bring a different look to the smartphone. One thing that make everyone unhappy that they don't give earphones with their products.\n\nCamera- It has a front selfie light rear camera which is of 12 megapixels which works very fine and takes beautiful selfies.\n\nBut overall, in this price range + sale I have got a very better product.",

            "Phone is extremely brilliant when it comes to that looks department what it offers in the price bracket is truly phenomenal the screen size is very good for movie is gaming and other stuff due to the 403 PPI the screen is very sharp and clear and the simple MI user interface it feels very smooth in operating the phone is very slim and after using the back cover it still feels very slim and comfortable in hand so it's not very good for one hand uses but net it's not a big deal all in all that create value for money product and there is no Rival to this phone in this price range and category",

No heating issue due to latest coating company has adopted.\n\nSpeaker:\ngood and loud speaker, Audio jack is good enough for a regular music lover\n\nCamera:\nDecent photos with front and back camera, if you're a photo freak, sorry this product can't suits you. For my use it is more than enough. I have used MOTO G5S+, in comparison Moto wins the battle.\n\nSpeed:\nNever ever faced any issue with this 3 GB RAM of mine, Eventhorough I use multiple apps.( I'm not a gamer)\n\nBuild and Design:\n10/10 for this.\nSleek, light weight, vibrant screen, tough( I have slipped it twice from a height of 1-2 feet on a marble floor, nothing happened) fits with all my tracks.\nDozens of strangers while commuting to office approach me in public transport and enquiries me about my phone due to it's great look.\n\nExcellent phone in this budget range.",

            "My review on the phone would be quite different as I am not typical android user, i wanted to buy \"note 5 Pro\" but it wasnt available so i went ahead with this one.\n\nI got this phone and used it for 4 days now. I mostly used iphone (still use it as main phone), and havent had used Android for a very very long time (gingerbread was last version i think) - I must say Android improved a lot.\n\nAbout the phone - this phone is no doubt a \"every penny worth\" phone at this price range - All my ratings are based on the price paid for the products - as I am not comparing it with Iphone or Blackberry Passport that I used before, obviously they were flagship of their respective brand.\n\nCamera - Not bad, but not very good under law light (my personal opinion) - front camara is better.\n\nBattery - I would give it 5/5 - since this is my secondary phone, i use it for extra activities - like music (couple of songs a day), games (only one game not more than 20 mins a day), fb about 15 mins a day, insta (about 10 mins a day), not too many calls. I can clearly use it for more than 2 days in single charge.\n\ndesign: not very stylish - I wanted to have honor 9 lite which is far better looking - but performance wins over look - since this is more durable. I only wish that the fingerprint scanning would be at the front. But I understand this is Android, so cant have it.\n\nhandling: even thought this is 6 inch screen (almost) I can handle it with one hand in most cases. kinda like that\n\nAbout android - since this is the first time, I am using after a long time - i dont know what to tell. Most people would complain about the update but frankly speaking, i dont care. As long as it work smooth and does the job. As I dont expect to use it for a very long time.\n\nAlso most importantly - most people would say - those who use iphone cant use android, as Iphone is more user friendly and secure. I dont think thats true - Of course iphone is secure and user friendly, but i think android is open source. :P\n\nIf you are looking to buy a phone under 15K, this could be your option. Thanks for reading and enjoy your phone.",
            "First of all, it got delivered just on the next day, so I would say superb delivery.\nAfter using it for 10 days, I can say everything about this mobile is awesome except the camera. Camera quality is pretty poor, images are not crisp sharp. Apart from that sleek design, display, performance are on top.",

            "This phone is a great value for money. I bought this on a flash sale and the phone was delivered to me on the very next day. Mi phones over the years have made a good name for themselves. The phones are made in India as it is written on the back of the packing. Mi note 5 has a huge 6\" screen which is more than enough for people who are looking forward to use it in playing games and watching movies. If you are smart and tweak the settings of this smart phone to just the right amount, 4000 mAH battery is more than enough to last the phone for 1.5 days. Slim and metal like finish of Note 5 phones makes it feel very comfortable to hold it in the hand. Like promised I got a slim back cover for the phone which was packed alongwith the phone, charger and sim opening pin. 3GB RAM will ensure smooth running of apps and 32 GB of internal memory will ensure ample space for storing official files and other data. Even if that is not enough, there is a provision for attaching a mico SD card in place of the second sim. Thank you XIAOMI for making this phone in such a small budget. Thank you Flipkart once again for making shopping so much more easy.",

Overall I have used previous mi devices and find this one also good .Without any second thought simply buy this phone if your budget is limited and u need good performance. If you are a camera accentric then this phone is not for you then u should consider the pro model of the redmi note 5 for better camera performance and also it has an upgraded processor too.If u are a budget oriented person simple buy redmi note 5 but if your budget is not a problem and you want to buy a good phone with best camera in it's segment with a latest processor with good performance in it's segment simply buy the pro model .But I think with this redmi note 5 you can do all your daily tasks without any fault.

As the asthmatic value of devise may be equal to the devises costing Rs 20000 to 25000 & operating as well as processing is very smooth & fast.

            "WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!!\n\nI am writing this review after one weeks' usage.\n1. clear and bright 5.99\" display which is the main attraction of this phone. the colours are vivid and significantly smooth operation. the touch is ulta smooth. hd videos and movies are fun to watch.\n\n2. 4000 mah bazooka battery which lasts a day with 10 hours of highend gameplay like asphalt 8 , mortal combat x, pes 2018 etc....\n\n3. camera is good in daylight. but if you need a device which can capture decent photos in both day and night, then this phone is not for you.\n\n4. fingerprint sensor is really fast. it really impressed me.\n\n5. I opted for 3gb/32gb version wherein i did not find any lagging or latency in multitasking. its powerful processor with 3 gb ram works just excellent. evenbif you are a heavy user, there is no problem at all. you can go for it even blindfolded.\n\n6. external speakers have a decent clear sound. though with headphones its better.\n\n7. the phone is sleek and can easily slip off your hand. So, please dont show-off. keep it inside a cover.\n\nAs per my usage so far for a 3gb/32gb version, I would highly recommend this phone to you!!!! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\n\nIn addition to that, I got the delivery a day early.

            "After using 10 days certain things i've notice regarding the REDMI NOTE5 3GB variant:\n\n1) The rear camera performance of the is average, if zoom then picture quality gets washed, sharpness vanishes, i don't know if it's a software related issue or Xiomi used an average camera.\n2) Outstanding display quality\n3) premium design and built quality\n4) Superb touch response\n5) good battery back up\n6) Outstanding front camera quality\n7)light weight\n8) intelligent and improved UI\n9)multi tasking, gaming experience is good\n\nIt's a good phone under 10k with a good selfie camera, but i must also request to consider other phones before buy Redmi Note5 because of it's average rear camera performance which is not satisfactory as of now, may future software updates can fix the issue but as of now rear camera performance is simply average.",

            "I ordered this device in the 2nd flash sale and got it delivered within just one day so very very impressed with the delivery service of flipkart..\nI am using this device since 10 days and so here is my experience with redmi note 5..\n\n1.camera (front 10/10 & rear */10)\nRear camera of this device is much improved as compared to other xiomi budget devices..it had good colours saturation and I am specially impressed with its performance in low light conditions.. talking about front camera it is satisfactory and clicks good pictures as am not a selfie addict so 5mp is sufficient for me..\n2. Battery (100/10)\nBattery of this is just extraordinary.other xioami devices are just no match for redmi note 5..!!!!!!also thanks for sd 625 processor.. i get 10-11 hrs sot regularly with heavy internet usage ..if u are a heavy user it will last easily hoto 1.5 days..\n3.design (7/10)\nAm not that much satisfied with its design of u look at its back side u won't recognized whether it is redmi note 5 or 4 or 3..\n4.screen (10/10)\nAs it comes with 18:9 aspect ratio watching movies and playing games is very enjoyable.. and other smartphones feels to old in hands..\n5.sound quality (9/10)\nSound in loudspeaker is adequately loud but it is not too loud but still I can say that sound is above average..and sound in earphone is also sufficiently loud..\n6.gaming (10/10)\nI am not that much heavy gamer but I still played wcc2 and hya sa and it ran smoothly i didn't notice any framedrops at all..!! And I also saw gaming review of this device and it is best device to play heavy games..\n7.performance (9/10)\nPerformance of this device is very good and runs smoothly but still I noticed minor lags here and there but it is not much of concern as they are not noticeable.. u won't notice such lags every time..\n8. Cellular call quality (10/10)\nI used idea sim on this device and the cellular call quality was very good..\n\n\n9. The only thing I didn't liked about this device is that it still comes with hybrid sim slot as they had added dedicated micro sd slot to redmi y1 so come on xioami u should have added dedicated slot to this device also..\u2639\ufe0f\u2639\ufe0f\n\nWho should buy this device??\nTo be honest it is not worth upgrading from redmi note4 but still if u used some other device and not satisfied with battery backup and gaming performance then at this price range there isn't any device who can beat redmi note 5..!!!!",

            "On time delivery by Flipkart!!!\nPhone looks great due to its 18:9 aspect ratio display\nPhone feels great in hands as it is thinner compared to all other Xiaomi devices\nCamera performs pity well in daylight as well as in low lighting conditions and supports full hd recording whereas front camera does a good job in this price range and it's flash light performs good in low lighting\nBattery performance is too good\nSound quality is also good and loud\nI am having 32 GB variant out of it gives 25gb\nThere was no heating issues but some heating was observed during charging\nOverall the phone come out to be good device",
            "It is a very good phone for moderate users. It features a very thin and stylish look with a 6 inch display. 3 GB of ram should be enough if you don't want many applications running all the time on your phone. Processor is old but in moderate usage it works very well and given the price of the phone it is the best processor you can get.\nPros:\nFront camera flash\nFinger print sensor\n6 inch display (18:9)\nGood battery life\nTV/AC remote (IR sensor)\nPre-installed antivirus and data cleaner.\nIt has a customizable user interface (Miui 9)\n\nCons:\nAndroid version is Nougat (Oreo update may come in a few months)\nNo usb c-type port (Personally I don't really a need C-type port)\nBezels are not that small as it looks.\nDecent camera. Low lighting conditions performance not good.\n\nVerdict:\nWorth the price.\nNot made for hardcore users, gamers and Camera lovers.",
            "Best quality screen in this price segment, comparable to amoled. it has 84% colour gamut, other devices have 72% colour gamut.\nBattery backup is really very good as expected.\nFront camera does its job well. Rear camera is far better than the RN4. Struggles a liitle bit in low light conditions.\nSDN 625 is a really good chip and it doesn't heat up ..\nRam management is good. I have tested with various apps in background.\nOne thing which I didn't like about the device is the rear camera bump. It will get scratches easily when the device will be placed on a table or anything like that.\nI really hate the hybrid sim tray systems.\nCall quality is really crisp and clear. No issue with the main loud speaker either.\nBest budget phone under 10k. No other manufacturers have a device like it.. It's really an allrounder..\nDon't think. Just go for it..",

I have been using it for more than 6 months now, continuous improvement has been done by small system updates and also it has not lagged till now.\n\nFor the camera it is good for this price but if you want a great camera phone at this price you need to go with the Xiaomi's own Redmi Y1.",

            "Bought this phone on April and now the glass is broken. I really don't understand why Xiomi does not concentrate about glass quality, this glass can be easily broken if it falls. I had Asus Zenfone earlier, i really appreciate about their glass quality(Gorilla glass) which is fantastic phone and did not see any scratch even though it falls.\n\nThis is second Redmi Note 5 that is broken. I know i should have put tamper glass but phone itself should have minimum capability to protect. Xiomi can be good company who provides lots of custom option in Android but i am satisfied about the phone quality.",

            "Reason to buy - It was hyped as india's camera beast.\n\nWhat I got - the note 5 NOT THE NOTE 5 Pro. Turns out the Note 5 I bought has only a single camera as the dual camera setup comes with a different model itself. Tough buying a phone.\n\nHow I felt - its almost same as my Note 4.\n\nNext Phone - NO !! Atleast I will never buy Xiaomi again. I have 5 phones from Xiaomi but unfortunately I got mixed up thinking this model is the one which was the advertised camera beast but it doesn't have bokeh mode or is non-effective or non-existent.\n\nREALIZATION - An old iphone 6s still beats it and so do the cheaper realme phones.\n\nAs the Xiaomi's premier model is beaten by devices both high & even low I realized that my Xiaomi fever is off now. And i'm only buying another phone when I really need one.\nEdit-its serving well today as a backup torch and battery life is good.",

            "processing speeds are good (not amazingly/very fast), screen is responsive and display is good at this price, viewing angles are small, speaker gives decent sound (not too loud) and doesn't distort at high volumes, gaming experience is good for low end games but for games like pubg, asphalt etc. works well in low settings. battery lasts for a day and half at low usage, less than a day for heavy photo clicking/maps usage/web browsing at high brightness.\n\ncamera (especially back) quality is below average (but what more can you expect at this price) may be, Redmi Note 5 Pro is much better phone than this (cause of having a good camera).\nI'll suggest you to buy that 'Pro' version at any upcoming Flipkart Sale rather than this one.",

            "Great build. Good looking phone. Possibly the cheapest phone in the country that has a snapdragon 625 and a 1080p screen. Good performance. MiUI is something that I actually don't like. #StockAndroid xD Camera is good. Not exceptional but you can't expect for a sub-10k phone. Even though it is 18:9, there is a significant chin which defeats the purpose of 18:9. Not a deal breaker for me. But in 2018 they still have micro USB is sucks. USB C is the present, not the future! And prospective buyers, don't wait for redmi 6/Note 6! It has a mediatek processor (slower) and plastic back! Buy this ASAP",

Camera wise, Good.. special option can take video in 4K quality, in redmi note 5 pro doesn't having 4k.. No heating problem.. I'm damn sure, for anyone searching mid range around 10k, Get it and Enjoy urself..\n\nFor my point of view, redmi note 5 cons ( still in Nougat OS) but this is not major cons.. Every mobile having pros & cons.. Depending our needs in mobile.. But I'm 100% satisfied in redmi note 5 @ 9,999/- price.. have a great day.. hope u can get some info from this..tanq..cheers.. :)",

Display\nit is also very sharp its a 1080p panel and everything looks sharp,but since its not a superamoled blacks are not deep blacks and contrast is not as compared to j7 with 720p samoled display.but you will not notice a difference in daylight atleast.\n4: processor and graphics.\nvery much capable soc in this phone , lagfree smooth performance can play heavy games like pubg mobile at medium settings lagfree.no complains here. beats the samsung phones in same budjet segment ,i have personally noted the performance difference between both devices simce i have j7 too which seriously lags in gaming perfomance.\n5: there are couple of bugs in this phone like simcard not detected at times, really frustrating.\n6: fingerprint sensor is fast and responsive, it has wireless screen mirroring option too.\n7: I guess people still have seevice and aftermarket support issues with the MI brand for those of us who does not live in cities or big towns at least, but nevertheless it is a value for money device.",
            "First of all I would like to thank flipkart for delivering this product on time. This phone is very good compared to the other phones. It look slightly better than the previous version. The battery is long lasting. One can use it for various purposes like watching movies, chatting and reading ebooks. There is no need to purchase tablet and kindle if you are using this phone. Its screen size is very large. Camera quality is also very good. It works smoothly. No heating problem. Cost is also very low compared to other phones in similar range.",
            "Superb phone with great battery life. quality of camera is great. I bought this for my mother and she loves it. Very fast and excellent phone.",
            "Pro's: Super fast super smooth MIUI so the ratings on software are all trash. regular updates. integrity is fkn excellent.\nCons: Camera isn't that good but is very good according to the price point. Also, camera colour is better than most other companies.",
            "nice service and very fast delivery im very happy for this phone thank",
            "Superb next day Delivery by flipkart. Though not happy with the packaging. I'm writing this review after using 7 days. Battery is awesome, no heating issue with the phone. Front flash is a good fit under this price, front camera quality not much impressive. Touch panel working flawlessly",
            "I hove got 3gb version @ 9k. Previously I was using 2gb version of Note 3 (cost 10k). I am giving a brief comparison.\n\nPros:\n1. Speed: Note 5 is faster as it has better processor and more RAM .\n2. Software: Software is updated in Note 5.\n3. Battery: No difference found in Battery.\n4. Screen: Though Note 5 has larger screen (18:9), it does not help much. YouTube and other videos play in smaller area. In Note 3 videos plays in full screen. This might be most of the videos are in 16:9 format. The same case is applied to Pictures. However in other cases, like text writing, reading, browsing etc., you will get advantage in Note 5\n\nCons:\n1. Camera: I am very much unsatisfied with camera of Note 5. Note 3 and 5 have (16+5) mp and (12+5) camera resp. But picture quality is very bad compare to Note 3. Even selfie light does not help as the quality of camera in Note 5 is very bad.\n\nOverall if you don't have any problem with bad quality picture you can definitely buy Note 5.",
            "nice one tough. handsome,fast phone\nlove fast charging and battery performance\ncamera is pretty good . overall a great phone\nand at last THANK YOU FLIPKART very great service",

            "Within 10k Redmi Note 5 gives you overall awesome experience, xiaomi main focus is to provide best quality product in minimum price range and that motive is being achieved by them mainly in India because people in India wants best product in cheapest price and that thing makes xiaomi to do more and more innovation in their product. Main highlights of this product is that it's fullview display 18:9, another it's awesome processor SD625 for this price segment I would say SD625 is the best processor, after that it's battery life is the again main highlight of this device it gives you all day usage if you are an moderate user, for gamers I would say this is the good device for you if you are looking for a phone that gives you great gaming experience within 10k price segment, and at last coming to the camera section it has camera that can give you great pics in the day light condition but from phone you can expect this kind of quality at this price range. So overall this product has done great job in all aspects. I hope this review will provide you some sort of guidance. Thank you",
            "Been a fan of the #Redmi brand phones from Xiaomi. Partly because it is well endorsed by Manu Jain, the brand head honcho in India, and also since it provides great value for money through their collaborative buyback schemes with partners. The camera quality is up-to-the-mark, with decent output in low light conditions. The battery backup is satisfactory, in spite of heavy use (mobile data and app based lifestyle purchases!). Devoid of accessories though,, this phone is a hit among friends and family purely because of its specs and ability to give a positive, user friendly experience. I look forward to many more good smartphones from the mother brand in the future. Cheers.",

            "Flipkart doesn't provide the option of half-rating. I mean to rate this product as 3.5 stars.\n\nAfter using it for couple of weeks I can definitely say that this phone is best in its segemnt.\nOnly problem is its sub-standard camera.\nI am fairly happy with its battery life, screen ratio, pixel density and performance.\nI can easily play heavy games without any significant lag.\n\nAlthough, other con is its slippery body and protuding camera.\nI do not like phone covers but in this case, having a phone cover is a necessity. Xiomi takes care of this and does provide a good quality, light weight, transparent cover but it kind of defeats the whole purpose of buying a bezel less phone.\n\nIt is almost impossible to use it without its cover without risking scratches on camera.\nScreen is durable too.\nI accidentally dropped my phone screen first on ground and surprisingly I couldn't find even a single scratch.\n\nIf only this phone had better back cover and less protuding camera, I would have given it 5 stars.",

Now about mobile, it is one of the best mobiles under 10k and since I prefer battery and durability over camera, therefore it is moch better than honor 9 lite. Talking about battery, when I received it 9n Wednesday it was at 66%, and after installing all apps and updates, the charge left was 9% till Saturday night. So if you prefer battery and durability and camera is not very important, go for it. But if you want camera, check the honor series and compare all pros and cons.",

            "The best in the biz made the best in the 10k bracket. The phone has a premium build increasing the face value much higher. The snappy Snapdragon 625 is the most effective and efficient processing units around so don't worry about your day to day hassle and some occasional gaming won't hurt the device and give you gaming experience you deserve. The newer version of the MiUi is one of the fastest custom skins on Android that I have used, as is the fingerprint sensor on the back. All in all the best deal you can get right now, the most optimal device one can buy without any second thoughts. Go ahead and buy one for yourself, won't be any regrets. The only drawback I saw was the camera bump but I can live with it as that thing does some amazing photography. The charger provided is not a fast charger but hey if you want something better you can always buy a fast charger and this is recommended for heavy users and charging a mammoth 4000 mAh battery is a task on its own, but when its fully charged you can go worlds with a single charge.",

The similarity is all the more prominent at the rear side. The front of the smartphone has some difference to offer. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 is the first budget smartphone of the company to come with a bezel-less display. The device comes with a same chassis with antenna lines running across the device but the a large and bright display is its highlight.\nThe smartphone comes with minimal bezels on the sides and this time the smartphone also comes with a selfie light flash. The smartphone is also slightly slimmer as compared to the Redmi Note 4. The handset is appears sturdy and boasts of good build quality. In fact, it is quite solid when compared to most smartphones in the market.",

If you prefer smaller screen i.e. 5.4 inch ,go for redmi 5 which uses Snapdragon 450 which is also good processor with 14nm technology which saves battery power.",
            "thank u Flipkart. and very fast delivery. nice work done by Flipkart",
            "Beautiful phone by redmi, note 5 is brillent awesome looking also, fast processor, but Camara as to improve, very nice moblie, must buy",
            "Excellent value for money. No doubt about it. Battery backup is superb. It takes some effort to fully drain out the battery. Camera quality is quite good. Selfies are decent. Haven't tried low light photography yet. Sound quality is up to the mark. You need decent earphones and the device won't disappoint you. Bass is good. Got a free back cover delivered with the device itself. It fits perfectly on the phone. It's been a week since I have been using this phone. My earlier phone Lenovo K5 Plus lacked battery backup. At this Redmi Note 5 32 GB is the best phone that you can buy under Rs. 10000/- in India right now.",
            "It's been a month since I ordered this device. I'm gonna share my views on this mobile.\n\nPROS:\n1. PROCESSOR: This mobile features a Snapdragon 625 Qualcomm 2 gHz processor which is the best in this price range. We also have a better processor in Asus Zenfone pro max which has Snapdragon 636 but it has only 1.8gHz clock speed. Hence I think both doesn't vary by a significant amount of performance.\n\n2. DISPLAY: It has 5.9 inch full hd+ display which gives a premium look. Even minute details are crystal clear.\n\n3. BATTERY: The Redmi note 5 definitely beats all other devices in the battery segment. I'm a hard core user, meaning I'd do things like rooting my mobile,install custom roms, keep changing my mobile features, keep experimenting new apps, watch YouTube videos for hours, play PUBG whenever I'm not doing any of the above, listen music all time in headset. I usually use my mobile throughout the day as I'm on holidays. It gave me SOT of 12-14 hours, which is the best at this price range.\n\n4. BACK PANEL: It has a metal finish which is classy as well as protective. No worries about dropping the mobile. Not like Honor 9 lite. Front panel is of gorilla glass.\n\n5. SOUND: The sound is good for normal users. It's sharp and clear.\n\nCONS:\n1. CAMERA: The default camera is good for normal users. But I was expecting for a good camera. The camera is almost the same as in RN4. If you have rooted mobile, I suggest you to use Google camera,which even has portrait mode which is awesome. I don't tell that the camera is worst. It's not upto my expectation. It's good for instagrammers.\n\n2. FINGERPRINT: I don't know if this is a pro or con, the fingerprint sensor is damn fast. It's so much fast that even before you place your finger fully it detects but since it detects half finger, it ends up showing wrong fingerprint. So i must place my entire finger quickly.\n\n3. SIM SLOT: It'd be better if we could insert 2 Sims and microsd at the same time.\n\nOVERALL SUGGESTION:\n\u2713 GO FOR THE PHONE WITHOUT GIVING A SECOND THOUGHT. I ASSURE YOU. YOU'RE NOT GONNA WORRY FOR BUYING THIS MOBILE. MY ENTIRE FAMILY NOW USES REDMI NOTE SERIES MOBILE AND NOT ONE HAS STOPPED WORKING. DONT THINK THIS AS A CHINA MOBILE. DONT THINK THAT SINCE MANY BUY THIS I WANNA BUY A DIFFERENT ONE. THEN YOU'LL END UP WORRYING. GO FOR REDMI NOTE 5.\n\u2713 TRUST ME THIS IS BEAST..",

            "Here is detailed review after using it for a week.\nWas having second thoughts after ordering it via Flipkart. was getting 1000INR cheaper at Amazon.\nNevertheless I ordered it from here. On initiate usage, the phone looked and felt premium. absolutely gorgeous with the gold champagne colour. I set it up and signed in to my Google account. Everything worked like a breeze.\nTrouble started when I wanted to transfer my contacts from the old phone to this one. The contacts app kept crashing. To this this I could not transfer my contacts via vCard. I had to resort to synchronizing my contacts via Google.\n\nWhen it's all said and done I update and installed some apps from the Play store. Everything was fine except for the battery life.\n\nI must say the battery depletes at a very fast rate when using the phone or even when I crank up the brightness outdoors.\n\nExcept for the battery life, everything seems to be fine with the phone.\n\nLet's hope for the best.\nAnirban Bhattacharya..",

Upper and lower bezels are are now more narrower and on screen buttons adds is a great addition.\nFront selfie cam has been upgraded though aperture remains the same but new front flash feature and little uograde of lens quality has somewhat compensated the small focal range of selfie cam.\nrear camera is now 12 megapixel but quality has somewhat improved over redmi note 4 13 mp lens.\nbattery life is amazingly great.\nSnapdragon 625 is still one of the most efficient, fast and tried & tested processor so i don't find any reason to replace it with any other processor and fortunately they have used SD 625 SoC.\noverall i can conclude that it is a great value of money and u r not going to get this much feature in any of the sub 10000 range smartphones.",

Screen is looking fantastic, (copied iPhone screen I guess). screen is the USP of this phone, once adjusted to it, it is fantastic.\n6. loud speaker is excellent compared to cool 1\n7. Ram management is not up to mark(actually not at all)\n8. And horrible music quality over headphones compared to cool1, cool1 is just awesome in this department, just awesome. note 5 is very treble biased, bass is horribly trampled. update: this is the only thing I am unable adjust with, very bad music.\n\nif you don't worry for updates, coolpad cool1 is fantastic buy , listening music on cool1 is an ethereal experience(though loud speaker is just horrible), and it is cheaper by 2k, my coolpad is broken so I have opted for this, only because of software(way better than cool 1).\n\nI don't understand , from FM the songs are pleasant but not from music players on redmi(may be FM gives processed songs by the studio equipment, instead of processing on device)\n\nIR remote cannot be trained on this device, and it is ok functionally(remote should be in list, local cable stbs may face trouble)\n\n\nMy only gripe with this phone is its music(as I am aware of is bad Canara before purchase), I don't feel like listening songs on this device, it is that bad.\n\nwould have given better music chip pricing it a bit higher. Then it would have been a perfect package.\n\nwell, for 10k it is super value for money for those who don't listen to music on their phones(earphones), screen is fantastic.\n\none think I like about this phone is, you get screen protector and silicone case in the box which is very helpful, because phone is very slippery (I mean if you don't use with case, it will definitely slip), it helps a lot.\n\nIF YOU ARE MUSIC ENTHUSIAST STAY AWAY FROM THIS PHONE (most everything except music, camera are value for money)",

            "I am using this phone for the last one week and I am more than happy & very much impressed with this Masterpiece. Being low priced, I thought that the quality maybe low but I was plesantly surprised to find everything is just good quality - be it the build quality, the screen etc. I was using Lenovo Vibe P1 and I must say the looks of this phone is Miles ahead of my previous phone. The bezels are really very narrow around and in fact this phone is of the same size of my last phone which had 5.5 inch screen. When I first saw Galaxy S8 I was blown away by the looks but this phone resembles S8 very much and I must say I am really blown away by the looks of this phone really a great phone for a great price. But I advice to go for the 4 GB variant as MIUI is very heavyweight and consuming nearly 2 GB of the 3 GB of RAM. My last phone which had only 2 GB ram, I used to get around 1.2GB of free ram on this phone I am getting only around 1.2 - 1.3 GB of RAM when idle. There are 3gb phones I have seen which get 1.8 free RAM when idle and this is really bothering me.",

            "I am using this Redmi Note 5 for almost 15 days and to be honest I am impressed with the performance of this device. Earlier I had been using Redmi 3S prime which served me pretty well for more than 1.5 yrs and still now in very good condition but as I need a big screen so I decided to buy this Note. The main pros are :\n1. Great 18:9 Display\n2. Sound is not very loud but it is enough for a smartphone 3. Battery lasts almost a day (actually I was hoping that it might not last for a whole day as the display size is bigger but I was totally wrong in that case). Also the phone supports fast charging but we have to buy a fast charger from the market.\n4. Simplistic design and MIUI is really smooth and easy to use plus the Mi theme store offers a huge collection of themes, wallpapers etc.\n5. No heating issue. There is no lag also. Ram management is really good for this device. Maybe the snapdragon 625 processor is now old but I feel it's enough to run this device.\n6. Front camera is really amazing. I am not a selfie lover but still I found that it is better than some other Samsung smartphone front camera with 10 to 15k price range.\n7. Dual apps and Second Space: this was the best thing for me when I used redmi 3s prime and now this is again a 100% hit for me in this device.\n\nThe Cons are :\n1. 32 GB is not enough in the storage section. We have a memory card slot but that is hybrid so if we use memory card we can't use second Sim card which is the most important drawback in this device.\n2. Some high resolution games like PES, Mortal Combat crashes some time. Actually it was PES that crashed more than 10 times although The FIFA mobile runs like a charm.\n3. Outdoor images are good when using back camera but indoor images are a bit hazy.",
            "* Five stars to Flipkart for fast delivery\n\nI am writing after using this device for almost 17 days.\n\nPhone is good as per design and build quality.\nGood battery life . Performance is good ; no heating issues but it has some issues. Phone runs smoothly ; doesn't lag... Infact it restarted itself ....thrice in these 17 days so that is quite disappointing....that's all.... no other issues I have seen yet!",
            "Very classic phone\nBut redmi note 4 was better than this\nAfter using redmi note 4 for a year i will say\nBaap baap hota hai and beta beta\nRedmi note 4 is according to me is much better than redmi note 5\n\nAfter using it for 2 days i would say ram management of redmi note 4 is much better\n\nAfter rebooting both devices my redmi note 4 shows free ram upto 1.8 gb but redmi note 5 shows 1.4gb\nAlso there are alot of app in my redmi note 4 which has become awesome with 9.5 update\nOn any video playing app like YouTube or anything where you play something on screen it doesn't cover full screen rather than there is about 1 cm space left on both upper and bottom sides. So it becomes same as redmi note 4 as in redmi note 4 there is full screen display\n\nSo it is same as redmi note 4\nYa it's camera is of very good quality\nFingerprint sensing is very fast\n\nOverall good phone but if you are heavy user then choose redmi note 4\nOtherwise go for pro version\nIt looks great\nBut har chamakti cheez sona nahi hoti\n\nSo i think my redmi note 4 is better than redmi note 5 except back camera and fingerprint sensing",

It looks really good as it have a very big screen and the screen almost covers whole body of the phone. I bought the 3gb ram 32 gb rom variant and i got the delivery in 2 days. Thanks to flipkart for that.\nPros.\n1.Really good battery. The battery manages to stay for one and a half day with average use. And also it gets charged up fast too.\n2.Really big screen and good display still a handy phone.\n3.The back camera seems to take very good pictures with very good detailing and gets focused fast enough.\n4.The fingerprint sensor is really fast.\n5.Also there is an in-box soft back cover for the phone.\n6.The 3 gb ram really supports the phone and does not hang or get heated while using.\nCons.\n1.The front cam struggles to take shots in low light even though there is front flash.\n2.Although the phone supports quick charging, the in-box charger is a normal one. Mi could have given a quick charger in-box.\n\nSo this is it. I think its the best phone for this price range.

            "The phone is brilliant at the first sight.\nI would like to conclude that it comes with a back silicon case and also with some sort of screen shield pre applied. It looks like an iPhone X and has very small bezzels with a navigation bar. Battery backup is unexpectingly outstanding as compared to note 4. This device is superior and I had loved to have it in my hands. Just the thing to worry about is it comes with Android v 7 that's nougat even after Oreo has been released and another thing that made me worry is the usb type. I was expecting usb type C in this device as it's a successor to note 4. Also it comes with an outdated processor snapdragon 625 and also an old design that Redmi is using for years.\nSurely Redmi note 5 pro looks an upgrade to note 4 and note 5 doesn't look much. It has been seen the camera is performing much more better than the previous versions. But still the portrait mode doesn't look performing great.\nYet the device has more positives than its negatives.\nAll over the device it great on its price and I would highly recommend the 3 GB variant instead of 4gb variant as it could bear almost everything.\nYup hands up on this phone guys check out my YouTube channel for more info i.e. KP Tech Cuber. Thanks for giving this thing your essential time.",
            "Phone was good with stylish look. Good battery backup. they was no hanging or lacking in the phone. UI software should be better they has to concentrate more on the UI. First time when i charge the phone i feel it was heating from the second time it was good.\n\nStill MI unable to provide three slots Two for the nano sim and one for the memory stick. this is disadvantage. you can place either second sim or memory stick both you can't.\n\nFinger sensor is good. Face unlock software still not exists in the MI Note 5.\n\nIn this price range 3GB with 32 GB ram for 9,999 and 4 GB with 64GB for 12999 is good. Check your usage related to the SIM slots and buy.\n\nCamera is OK for regular usage don't expect too high picture quality.",

And i don't regret the decision.\nI have already installed 3 updates within 2 months of buying. Currently i am using the MIUI 10.0.2.0 Global running on Android Oreo 8.1. Let me be clear that i am not a heavy user. So basing upon my needs i am utterly satisfied with the performance,camera and battery. There is face unlock (which is quite good) and bokeh mode for selfies if you are looking for those. The UI is stable, bugfree and had no lags during my day to day use.\n\nDevice is very thin and feels nice to hold. Design is minimalistic. Display is crisp and has gorilla glass protection. Also comes with a transparent case. So you can be a little less worried about damaging the display. Battery easily lasts 2 days for my use and can easily give 1 day with heavy usage.\n\nThe absence of dual rear cameras can be a deal-breaker for many. And some features of Android Oreo is not supported on MIUI which according to me is the only drawback of the UI.\n\nBut for casual use, there should be no complaints.",
