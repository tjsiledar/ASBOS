            "A very good hope by Micromax\nDisplay is very good bright and punchy colors . Screen guard and tempered glass is in the box\nGaming and performance was good enough for everyday use\nBattery life is excellent and 30w charger is a add on in this price segment.\nCamera was good but need some software optimization s\nWide angle at daylight works good in normal conditions but struggle s with portrait shots even with depth sensor edge selection was not perfect.but the colors and details were good low ...\nREAD MORE",
            "Nice Phone Thanks micromax its clear stock android and made in india so i liked .. the display if far better than realme GT master edition ... You can go for it perfect combination.",
            "Nice handy phone,\ninitial impression:\n\nwhat seems good:\n----------------------------\n-Glass back makes it feel premium\n-AMOLED screen is nice\n-handy in comparison to other other phones (as it is ~74mm wide)\n-support 5Ghz wifi band\n-stock android, no advertisement like other Mi or Realme or even Samsung mobiles in the same range\n-mobile can be made multi-user (just like laptop)\n-nice battery backup.\n-user interface is fast like, opening menu or apps\n\nwhat don't seems good:\n---------------------------\n-very stock android, very less customisation is available\n-no app lock feature\n-battery % is not clearly visible\n-Dark mode is not exactly black, it is greyish. However drop down menu is deep black, so UI doesn't feels synchronised.\n-cannot remove Google search bar from home screen\n\nnot fond of:\n----------------------\u2014----------\n-The screen flicker in Light mode of brightness is reduced below certain level. You can mitigate it by enabling Dark mode, as you'll not notice it further. (or it might goes off after someday of use, can't say)\n-Camera shutter speed is quite slow.\n-something is missing in screen, colors are bit more saturated.\n\nCan't say right now about:\n-----------------------------------------\n-shooting video\n-location accuracy",
            "Man What A great device.\nIn hand feel absolutely super\nCamera in day gorgeous\nIn night lol\nBattery performance : damn long you will take it for a day\nCharging - super powerful 0-100, 1 hr and 10 minutes\nDisplay : dude it's colours feels natural more brighter and so much\nPerformance : in this price, common it's definitely crazyy!!\n\nThat's all it's sexy shiny not so big. There fore 100 percent recommended.",
            "Overall a great product really enjoying it.. really fast fingerprint sensor...great looks, nice performance haven't got any lag till now.. really nice battery backup.. have just a few dips.. like no app lock facility, bit of red tint in display at low brightness.... also visible in camera pics and videos..no long screenshot facility.. screen mirroring process is complicated... Requesting micromax to solve these issues via update as soon as possible.",

            "Nice handy phone,\ninitial impression:\n\nwhat seems good:\n----------------------------\n-Glass back makes it feel premium\n-AMOLED screen is nice\n-handy in comparison to other other phones (as it is ~74mm wide)\n-support 5Ghz wifi band\n-stock android, no advertisement like other Mi or Realme or even Samsung mobiles in the same range\n-mobile can be made multi-user (just like laptop)\n-nice battery backup.\n-user interface is fast like, opening menu or apps\n\nwhat don't seems good:\n---------------------------\n-very stock android, very less customisation is available\n-no app lock feature\n-battery % is not clearly visible\n-Dark mode is not exactly black, it is greyish. However drop down menu is deep black, so UI doesn't feels synchronised.\n-cannot remove Google search bar from home screen\n\nnot fond of:\n----------------------\u2014----------\n-The screen flicker in Light mode of brightness is reduced below certain level. You can mitigate it by enabling Dark mode, as you'll not notice it further. (or it might goes off after someday of use, can't say)\n-Camera shutter speed is quite slow.\n-something is missing in screen, colors are bit more saturated.\n\nCan't say right now about:\n-----------------------------------------\n-shooting video\n-location accuracy",
