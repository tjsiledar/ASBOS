            "Camera and display quality is very nice. I'm impressed. Its been almost 4 months I'm using This phone. I'm getting Security updates just like android one phones. I'm not a hardcore gamer but i have played pubg several times on max graphic settings. Didn't have any issues. I didn't face any heating issues till now. Sound quality is very nice on Dolby atmos mode.\nOne and only thing i Don't like is it's back panel. Its very thin and low quality. Getting scratched easily. You should put a good cover other wise it will get damaged easily.\nThere are lots of features inside this phone like we can directly connect to windows , samsung pay etc..\nI'm giving 4/5 .",

No lag, no heating issue for normal usage and while gaming also there is no over heating issue and no lag in high graphic settings.\n\nBattery -\nFor 2-3 hours gaming, YouTube, social media and calling I'm getting upto 12 hours backup. Battery could be better.\n\nCamera-\nOIS is great, but struggles in low light conditions.\nOther than that camera is awesome.\nRefer some YouTube for details camera reviews\nSuper study mode is very good but video resolution is not good in super study mode.\n\nDesign-\nBackside looks is good but camera hump is quite high and Mobile is not that much handy as compare to a50. Back panels easily get scratches so we should use a back cover.\n\nDisplay-\nGreat display, camera hole is very small so looks great, viewing angles are good.\n\nSpeaker-\nStereo speakers are very good and supports Dolby. So we will get wonderful experience while watching films and videos.\n\nCharging-\nIt will takes 1.45 hours to complete charge with in box 15w charger. Mobile supports 25w charger which is not included in the box. In 25w charger mobile charges in approx 1 hour.\n\nFinger print-\nFinger print scanner not fast as side/rear mounted. But does its job even after applying tempered glass. Tips to speedup biometric scanner- turn of unlocking animation and go to battery optimization - search com.samsong.biometric - disable battery optimization.\n\nPhone's vibration is very weak .\n\nSome files like Spotify offline downloads and some big files are automatically deleted. So go to battery and device care - click on 3 dots which can be seen at top right side then select storage booster here turn off auto delete unnecessary data.",
            "Really i have no words to describe this phone . I got this phone on last Friday . First i thought samsung phone was some rumours about system hang and etc. But this phone proved mid range bumper if you are planning to buy mid range under 30k this phone gives you comfort and good camera budget under 30k.so you should buy this phone !! Camera amazing , performance 90HZ amazing , display no words for display , battery 4500MH is enough for if you are a normal user otherwise if you are a gaming person then its little bit difficult for them to battery backup but still its good optimization to handle . No heating issue , water and dust proof .\nHope you like my review",
            "After 4 days of usage, I feel the battery backup is not that satisfactory; gets drained quickly even with light usage. The display and speaker are superb. The camera performance is also upto the mark. There are no such lags upon normal usage (thanks to the Snapdragon processor), although the device gets quite warm when put to charge. Overall it is a good purchase, would have been great if the battery was of at least 5000mAh at this price range. I would surely recommend this phone.",

            "I gifted the phone to my Dad and he absolutely loved it.\nDesign is somewhat similar to previous galaxy A51 but snapdargon 720G processor this time makes all the difference.

Camera is one of its strong selling point and battery is top notch for this price range.\nIf you a casual to moderate user then I highly recommend this phone to you.",

            "Absolutely Brilliant phone. Samsung has improved on software front & it's clearly visible once u start using it. Water resistance is cherry on top.\nSome negative. No faster charger in box, even though phone supports it. Might not support High quality gfx but COD, Fifa works fine.",
            "I bought this on 10 days before.\nDisplay- very beautiful and punchy\nCamera- both cameras are excellent.\nBattery backups- superb, for normal user, it will go for one and half day easily.\nSpeaker- stereo speakers, best in class.\nProcessor- power efficient and powerful enough. No lag at all.\nSound quality - just amazing.\nSignal strength- great with carrier agreegation (4g+)\nIp 67 rating.\nSoftware update- 3 years of Android + 4 years of security patch update, best deal for a mobile to get.\nThough it is costlier than other mobiles by 2000 to 3000 rupees in terms of specifications but it will not disappoint you at all.",
            "Very good camera... But a bit overpriced. You can get the same configuration with other brands under 20k. But overall very nice phone and very nice design.",
            "This phone has many plus factors:\n\n- Looks nice.\n- Gets warm during charging but during regular use, is normal. I talk mostly on the headset.\n- Great camera. Shortcuts to zoom etc while taking photos. Shoots stunning pictures and videos.\n- Takes good pictures in low light as well.\n- Nice enough speaker, although there are better phones with speakers if you are into hearing loud music on the speaker of the phone.\n\nThe only thing I disliked is the bloatware that comes preinstalled. Lot of apps like Dailyhunt, Primevideo etc are preloaded. Removed them all and got it as close to Android one as possible by installing Google Phone, Google Calendar, Chrome Browser etc.\n\nAll in all, a solid phone with great hardware and the price it is offered.",
            "Really forgot to post the review for this wonderful purchase. Thanks to folks at samsung for this amazing model. I'm happy and satisfied with the purchase.",
            "A good all round phone .I purchased for my son keeping in mind that 3 software updates and 4 years of security updates .He is happy about it and claiming that it is better than his LG G6 which he was using for the last 3 plus years.",

I noticed some light sound near the bottom of the camera bump and the phone rim when I lightly press that area. As if the plastic back was not properly glued. This scared me on the authenticity of water resistant feature but I'm more scared to test that feature\n2. After initial setup, when I was working in settings I found the phone taking some more time to search or apply /save configurations than expected(this was observed even before I installed any other apps)\nTaking note that it's samsung brand A series phone and having latest snapdragon chip I was a bit disappointed in those fronts\nApart from that I'm good on other departments",
