            "It is a detailed review of this budget\nsmartphone.\nCONS-\nSECURITY-\nThere is a big security issue in this budget smartphones as you can see in above images the system apps like gallery,music player, sound recorder are asking permission to make and manage phone calls and without the permission the app doesn't work, what's the need of permission to manage phone calls in this basic apps, company should seriously roll out a update to fix this.\nDual volte-\ndual volte does not work in any sim you can use volte only in one sim at a time as you can see in above image.\nNotification led-\nThis phone does not have notification led it is shown as it have notification led in description of product on flipkart.\nBattery backup-\nBattery backup is average it only lasts half day on minimum usage and it takes 3 and a half-hour to charge up full\nPros-\nGrip is awesome in this smartphone it is very easy to carry along.\nIt has many features such as double tap to wake,sleep\nFlip to mute alarm,phone\nPut your ear towards phone to accept phone call or put your ear towards phone to go to handset mode from speaker mode\nPick up phone to wake the screen\nNet speed-\nNet speed and network is best in this device.\nThe only big issue in this device is security.",
            "Best affordable smart phone for low budget, with a lot of features. I ordered this for my dad, but I would like to have this one for my own.. \ud83d\ude07",
            "Good for daily use as a secondary phone.\nHD IPS display in this price range best supports Youtube video upto 1080p and 720p50fps.\nAs battery mentioned 5000mah but not upto mark compare to Samsung phones 500mah Battery charging takes upto 3hrs full charge from 0-100%.\noverall performance good 24gb user available.\n6\" inch display best in this price range.\nBut comming to headphones listings songs on youtube if you are bass lover then not expected to much.\nonly secondary dual 4g active sims works and daily normal tasks works fine.\noverall 10 out of 8.\nafter a month use review.",
            "Frankly speaking it is one of the most best budget phone with best of specifications and display and basic functionality at this price point. You can get this features on other phones as well but certainly not at this price. It is can be used for rough and tough purpose an extensive daily uses if you want to keep a second phone.really I do not have much idea about any phone specification and their speed at this price point but I do certainly feel it is really more then what the prices set at. If you are expecting something best within 5000 or 5500 just close your eyes and buy it.\nThe display is as good as amoled display at this price point. My experience and review is unbiased as I am already using Google pixel 4A and iPhone and iPad pro but at the same time I wanted to to gift my mother in law a budget and a very user friendly phone with big battery but after buying it I was amazed to find that my past Motorola G7 phone and Motorola E4 Plus looks nowhere near it both in functions in speed and price. I liked it so much that I purchased another one for my driver also.\nSo here is my final outcome and verdict.\n\nThe phone working speed is as good as any 10 to 15 thousand priced phone at least far better than G7 Motorola which I purchased last year for 17000 ke but still lags than Gionee Max.\nIt has a wonderful and speedy face unlock feature which my pixel 4A and even Motorola G7 do not have it.\nAnd not to talk about the battery which is the best part it's a battery beast.\nI would give four out of five in camera quality which I am still testing but feel like the pictures are very original real like. And if you can get this phone with cashback on cards it will be extra treat to your pocket also.\nAnd lastly and not the least it is is made in India product.",
            "Firstly thank you Flipkart for delivering the order in just 2 days and providing me this mobile in very good price with all your offers.\nGionee is a good brand and it's mobile last long if you are a good user. I am personally using Gionee M2 as my secondary device from past 5.5 years.\nGionee max is a very good mid ranger phone and it has a good user interface. It suits best for average to mid range user. The only issue I observed in the mobile that it gets warm and the battery gets drain fast if you do multi-tasking on it. Rest everything is fine for me in this mobile.",
            "Good product this price range\n1: better battery backup\n2: Best display quilty\n3: Best notch display\n4: Best back camera & average front camera\n5: improve ram mangment and system UI\n6: Average performance not excellent not very good but OK all over Good #Gioneemax",

            "Frankly speaking it is one of the most best budget phone with best of specifications and display and basic functionality at this price point. You can get this features on other phones as well but certainly not at this price. It is can be used for rough and tough purpose an extensive daily uses if you want to keep a second phone.really I do not have much idea about any phone specification and their speed at this price point but I do certainly feel it is really more then what the prices set at. If you are expecting something best within 5000 or 5500 just close your eyes and buy it.\nThe display is as good as amoled display at this price point. My experience and review is unbiased as I am already using Google pixel 4A and iPhone and iPad pro but at the same time I wanted to to gift my mother in law a budget and a very user friendly phone with big battery but after buying it I was amazed to find that my past Motorola G7 phone and Motorola E4 Plus looks nowhere near it both in functions in speed and price. I liked it so much that I purchased another one for my driver also.\nSo here is my final outcome and verdict.\n\nThe phone working speed is as good as any 10 to 15 thousand priced phone at least far better than G7 Motorola which I purchased last year for 17000 ke but still lags than Gionee Max.\nIt has a wonderful and speedy face unlock feature which my pixel 4A and even Motorola G7 do not have it.\nAnd not to talk about the battery which is the best part it's a battery beast.\nI would give four out of five in camera quality which I am still testing but feel like the pictures are very original real like. And if you can get this phone with cashback on cards it will be extra treat to your pocket also.\nAnd lastly and not the least it is is made in India product.",

Rear camera is good in day light.. but surprisngly not to bad in artificial lighting.. it has HDR & NIGHT modes.\nHand feel of this mobile is not such cheap feel..\nYou will ever never feel that the mobile is of rs4999.\nBattery stay almost 1day in heavy usage.. Normal usage it stays 2days.\nLastly I will say I just astonished how gionee is providing it at rs4999.Many other brands with less specs with more pricing they are proving.\nOne thing I like to share what I noticed there is software issue..e.g one alarm sign alwyas shows at top bar beside battery percentage.As I didnt put any Alarm but sing or notification is showing.It is a glitch.\nNo scuch Ads comes.only one gn_notifiction always comes...I didnt found any solution to stop the notification.No such blotware..or useless apps..You can unistall or disable apps.\nOne good feature is that you can use the SD CARD as internal storage.where you can expand the storage also can install apps.",

Especially Gionee Push that continously keeps on pushing notifications. Given the spying scandal that Gionee found itself in, more transparency should have been provided.\n2. RAM insufficient, phone hangs everytime. Android go should have been given, instead full Android 10 is provided which is difficult to run in only 2 gb ram. A 3 gb variant should have been provided.\n3. Charger is underpowered, phone takes over 3 hours to charge.\n4. Device gets heated while watching online content such as Netflix/Amazon Prime.\n5. Warranty issues as the phone is actually manufactured by Karbonn and Gionee refuses to provide warranty.\n\nBetter to go for Micromax in b by spending extra 1k\nUpdate :- After barely 2 months of usage, the Voleme up button has stopped working!",

These things can be frustrating at times. My earlier phone YU ACE had the same type of problems.\nOther than this the phone is a highly recommended one. Reliability cannot be stated as the phone is around a month old.\n\nEDIT: The frustration has come to next level, hence, editing my star rating. The apps like MX takatak( also lite version), Josh, winzo, etc. get installed by themselves automatically and will also start by themselves. Interrupting a call/video in the middle.

They do give this prize during special sale days. Even during normal days they do give at this range. Dont go for it at 6k rate\nIts just for those who are looking smart phone @5k budjet\n\nPros\nWorth for money(5500 inr)\nI think at this range no other mobiles gives u this much specs ( considering this as a reasonable n good indian made product)\nBack camera is good. Bokeh effect not that much attractive. But normal camera is good enough\nNotch Display is brilliant. Colours are too good\nMobile size and design is very handy\nWeight of mobile is reasonable. Very nice to operate it.Not like heavy chinese mobiles with large batteries\n\nConn\nSelfie camera is not good(even it is saying 5MP not upto mark)\nBattery charging tooks very long time.\nIts made of plastic back cover\nNo finger print sensor. (Its not a big deal as it has face unlock option)\nOn initial set up youtube opening and all took lots of time. Though it worked easly after that\nSome scrap applications were there.

Fit finish up to the mark does not feel like budget phone at all. Face unlock does it's job however fingerprint sensor would have been bonus.

We were happy for that but after all the stupid formalities completed at night about 9:30-10 PM the pick up boy calls and tells me that more 1500 is required . Just u guess if u exchange your old phone and pay the amount and after that many hours later u get a call that u have to . pay more . Isn't this disgusting !! U added again Rs. 800 to that product and we gave it ! But again how ur adding more Rs. 1500. I am really disappointed with Flipkart . I just hate this !! . It's better if u would see my review and take an action otherwise many middle class customers like me will get totally disappointed with ur work !! Just take an action !!

Not heavy ,fits in hand. Face lock doing great. No auto brightness. Heating is an issue especially on the chin of the phone. Best pick for someone who does calls WhatsApp YouTube hotstar like stuffs. Almost take 1gb ram to run UI. But it has a nice interface and lot of features. Touch screen is very responsive. Not for heavy gaming. We can run upto 3 or 4 regular apps in background without lag. But if we try to do more app will close automatically, that's the only disappointment. Other wise no problem. I bought it for my father and he is so happy.",

There are a lot of cost cutting which you might not expect from a 6k phone.\nThe good things are it has a great display which is very vibrant with dew drop. Then its size which is larger. Front camera is okay, but rear camera is the worst shouldn't cut price on that. Speaker seems good. Body is fine, but don't drop it. Battery even though it is 5000mah, screen on time is low compared to the capacity. And it takes a lot of time to charge that feels weird still it's charger is 2Amps. The radio feel good no connectivity issues, the soc inside of it is Unisoc I believe not the best. Not smooth and it lags due to 2GB Ram and Android 10 can't handle it. Overall the phone is nice for the price but they cut the cost in most important aspects. I still partially recommend this to all.",
