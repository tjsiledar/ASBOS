            "Decent product at this price segment,\nbrave investment as a long term especially in terms of durability and reflective design ,storage ( but if you don't want durability ) ,\nthen you can go for redmi note 10 pro, which is far better option but still realme phones are far better than other handsets in durability",
            "Detailed Review of Realme 8 ( used for 15 days )\n\n1. Excellent display , Amoled display is really good for watching movies n for daily usage.. - 10/10\n2. Battery backup - from 6 am(100%) in the morning till 5 pm in the evening , i did 3 online classes ( 1 hour each ) listened to some music , saw youtube , took 5 pics, did lot of calls and when i came back home at 5 i have 70% battery remaining.-9/10\n3.finger print sensor - 88% of the time it was accurate n working , sometimes when ur hand is full of dust,oil,water it may not work properly..but 88% of the time it works so smooth..it takes 1 second to scan .but its worth it .the animation everything feels like u r holding a premium device -7/10\n4.camera\n1. 64 mp main sensor mode - clear and colourful images , really it shoots awesome pictures , its so clear n crispy , it adds colour to the pics ( boosting )-8/10\n2.Ultrawide - its good , it takes beautiful images , but when you zoom in the clarity will go , its just a 8 mp sensor...but it clearly captures everything on frame -7/10\n3.other 2 cameras - useless , the depth sensor is okay\n4.portrait mode - it captures beautiful portrait pictures 75% of the time it captures perfect portrait keeping all d edges clear. The front camera also captures awsome portraits.- 7/10\n5.The pictures are colour boosted , we feel like the pictures r taken from iphone ... Its realy colourful n clear on the photo mode n 64 MP\n5.charging time - it takes 1 hr 10 minutes to charge , really good fast charging , doesnt heat heavily during charging - 9/10\n6.front camera - to be frank , it wasnt good enough , its due to some software issues i think , the pictures taken on portrait mode were very good compared to normal photos , but it captures GOOD pictures .\n7. VIDEO - THE PLACE WHERE THIS PHONE LOST ITS POWER. STABILIZATION , THE PHONE SUPPORTS EIS , ULTRA STEADY MODE , ULTRA STUDY MAX MODE , BUT IT DOESNT WORK WELL , THE NORMAL VIDEO MODE WORKS SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE UIS , UIS MAX MODE . THE NORMAL MODE CAPTURES STABLE VIDEO BUT NOT THAT STABLE , THIS CAN BE SOLVED BY SOME SOFTWARE UPDATES FOR THE CAMERA . THIS IS REALLY A BIG PROBLEM AND THE COMPANY SHOULD DO SOMETHING VERY QUICKLY -6/10\n6.heating issues - this device doesnt heat up much ... Nice optimization -8/10\n7.UI - realme ui 2.0 is really good .no ads...its very fluid , easy to use..better than mi ui and samsung ui\n8.built quality - 8/10\n9. Design - nyc design , the front looks like oneplus device , and back due to big cameras looks attractive\n-8/10\n10. PROCESSOR/ PERFORMANCE- VERY WELL OPTIMIZED , NO HEATING ISSUES , GAMING CHIP ACTUALLY , I PLAYED PUBG N ASPHALT , IT WAS GOOD , BUT IN HIGH GTAPHICS U CAN SEE FRAME DROPS , BUT FIR NORMAL GAMING ITS A BIG YES\n11. storage - u get 128 gb of storage , (109 unused ) .",
            "Nice mobile , awesome on screen finger print. Nice features nice look. New guesture features , new screenshot features.",
            "I bought it for my mom, as it looked slim and handy with nice display and having better battery backup. To my surprise, the phone looked so stylish and the display is perk as expected. The built quality is found to be better than any other android phone in this segment. Great package from Realme and quick delivery by Flipkart made this order a happier one.",

            "Detailed Review of Realme 8 ( used for 15 days )\n\n1. Excellent display , Amoled display is really good for watching movies n for daily usage.. - 10/10\n2. Battery backup - from 6 am(100%) in the morning till 5 pm in the evening , i did 3 online classes ( 1 hour each ) listened to some music , saw youtube , took 5 pics, did lot of calls and when i came back home at 5 i have 70% battery remaining.-9/10\n3.finger print sensor - 88% of the time it was accurate n working , sometimes when ur hand is full of dust,oil,water it may not work properly..but 88% of the time it works so smooth..it takes 1 second to scan .but its worth it .the animation everything feels like u r holding a premium device -7/10\n4.camera\n1. 64 mp main sensor mode - clear and colourful images , really it shoots awesome pictures , its so clear n crispy , it adds colour to the pics ( boosting )-8/10\n2.Ultrawide - its good , it takes beautiful images , but when you zoom in the clarity will go , its just a 8 mp sensor...but it clearly captures everything on frame -7/10\n3.other 2 cameras - useless , the depth sensor is okay\n4.portrait mode - it captures beautiful portrait pictures 75% of the time it captures perfect portrait keeping all d edges clear. The front camera also captures awsome portraits.- 7/10\n5.The pictures are colour boosted , we feel like the pictures r taken from iphone ... Its realy colourful n clear on the photo mode n 64 MP\n5.charging time - it takes 1 hr 10 minutes to charge , really good fast charging , doesnt heat heavily during charging - 9/10\n6.front camera - to be frank , it wasnt good enough , its due to some software issues i think , the pictures taken on portrait mode were very good compared to normal photos , but it captures GOOD pictures .\n7. VIDEO - THE PLACE WHERE THIS PHONE LOST ITS POWER. STABILIZATION , THE PHONE SUPPORTS EIS , ULTRA STEADY MODE , ULTRA STUDY MAX MODE , BUT IT DOESNT WORK WELL , THE NORMAL VIDEO MODE WORKS SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE UIS , UIS MAX MODE . THE NORMAL MODE CAPTURES STABLE VIDEO BUT NOT THAT STABLE , THIS CAN BE SOLVED BY SOME SOFTWARE UPDATES FOR THE CAMERA . THIS IS REALLY A BIG PROBLEM AND THE COMPANY SHOULD DO SOMETHING VERY QUICKLY -6/10\n6.heating issues - this device doesnt heat up much ... Nice optimization -8/10\n7.UI - realme ui 2.0 is really good .no ads...its very fluid , easy to use..better than mi ui and samsung ui\n8.built quality - 8/10\n9. Design - nyc design , the front looks like oneplus device , and back due to big cameras looks attractive\n-8/10\n10. PROCESSOR/ PERFORMANCE- VERY WELL OPTIMIZED , NO HEATING ISSUES , GAMING CHIP ACTUALLY , I PLAYED PUBG N ASPHALT , IT WAS GOOD , BUT IN HIGH GTAPHICS U CAN SEE FRAME DROPS , BUT FIR NORMAL GAMING ITS A BIG YES\n11. storage - u get 128 gb of storage , (109 unused ) .",

I'm a college student , so u can guess the usage of phone . Even if I use continuously throughout day , battery will long last . You can use throughout a day if u charge once\n\n3.

            "Writing this review after 20 days of usage so here are some features which I found really good in this device is a good quality amoled display sporting under display fingerprint scanner, it gives around 1 day battery backup after full charge..not to forget it has 30watt dart charging technology which charges the Device very quickly. They provided 128gb storage as default which is quite enough for an average user now coming to the short comings I found camera's performance quite average. shooting videos was tough in beginning because of stabilization issues which they have fixed by an update but some works are still to be done on that. I don't play games so can't really say on that. Further stating on the UI,realme is good and seems to be very much close to stock with 1 or 2 bloatwares which can't be disabled or uninstalled. It is plastic built and has a glastic finesse which attracts too much fingerprints so please apply a case and use it and that's all I can say about it...will definitely update if I remember or find something which needs to be said about the device.",

            "Posting this after 3 weeks usage. (Previously I owned Poco M2 Pro)\n\nPROS:\n\nScreen: Great amoled screen, gets pretty bright for outdoor usage. Colours are vivid with good viewing angles. Not a fast refresh screen but UI is smoother than Xiaomi phones so it feels almost same. Dragontrail glass protection is similar to Gorilla Glass 5.\n\nProcessor: GPU performance is great. CPU performance is similar to Snapdragon 720G. Overall for the price it's good\n\nUI: Interface is fast, organised & bloatware free unlike Xiaomi phones. There's lag only for the time when you wake it up from standby. RAM management for 4GB variant is similar to Xiaomi phones with 6GB RAM.\n\nBattery: Battery life is pretty good even with AOD on. Get around 2 days of normal usage with 8 hrs screen on time\n\nCharging: Took exactly 66 mins to full charge. Around 40 mins gets it to 80-85%. More safe, efficient and fast than Xiaomi 33W chargers.\n\nCalls & Connectivity: Clear audio during calls. No connectivity issues for WiFi or Bluetooth.\n\nBody: At 177g it feels like the lightest phone in a long time. Good bodyweight distribution too. Despite a plastic body feel in hand is good.\n\nCONS:\n\nBiggest con is CAMERA. It is really horrible in indoor lighting. Does okayish in outdoor situation. Unoptimised Camera App is the main reason. GCAM results are pretty good. But still GCAM isn't too well optimised for Mediatek processors. Ultrawide is unusable for Indoor lighting. Produces average result in Outdoors.\n\nCarrier aggregation is missing\n\nStereo speakers are obviously better but for a mono speaker it's loud enough.\n\nGo for this phone over Redmi Note 10S (similar specs) only if you want good UI experience. Only reason I bought this is because Xiaomi phones are full of ads, bugs & lags.",

But miui 12 is filled with some bugs, and bloatware, on the otherhand realme ui is one of the best ui after Samsun ui. So think before choosing between these two. Also the antutu acore is also good of this realme 8. It is near poco x3. So u can go for it. But if u are looking for Snapdragon chipset, then it is not for you.",

But has google dialer which is good for privacy but call recording is honest (that it shouldn't be)\n2.Performance: G95 is very good chipset freefire high setting 55-60 FPS, Fortnite Medium settings below or around 30 Fps, Citra emu also runs decently(even its not sdm)\n3.Display:its Samoled so very good. colors are punchy and Blacks are awesome but sometimes red looks like a bit orange side(but its nit picking....display experience is best ever for me)\n4.download and upload seed are also good:)\nin used mobile date D.s=29.98 Mbps ans Us=14Mbps (But career aggregation is missing)\n5.Themals:It is very good as per thermals, haven't seen it hot till now (even not too warm)\n6.Charging Speed: 1 Hr for full charge\n7.Battery life: almost one day easily with mixed usage (gaming + videos mostly youtube + browsing etc.)\nNow cons\n1.Camera: in short \"can be improved\" I checked camera sensor name its showing sony imx 682 but being sony it should be very good but it comes out average. checked Gcam m where it was slightly better\nDynamic range:Good\nClarity: average\nSupports 10x digital zoom\nafter 4x zoom image become oil painting type :(\nBtw + point supports 4K 30 fps 1080p 60fps\n2.Always on display has less features than other UIs but idc about that UI is still well optimized .One bug in Dark mode youtube comments typed by user becomes invisible. Rest all fine\nAs per todays date, If your budget is less than 15K and 5G doesn't matter to you and you can trade off average camera to performance and user experience then go buy it\n\nBeside I bought it in 14 K 4gb +128 variant\nDelivery was also good from flipkart",

            "I have using realme 7 from last 6 months and after hearing a lot of positive reviews I finally decided to purchase realme 8 and upgrade my smartphone. The build quality of this phone has improved a lot, it is very slim and light weight compared to its previous generation. The display has also been upgraded to AmoLED and the quality of the display used is amazing. Camera is also very good and even the over all performance is very smooth and responsive.",

The camera is very good and the display is also good. The battery backup is not great but the 30 watt in the box dart charger really does the job. The case I got within the box was a bit too tight and it becomes a problem when you put on a screen guard. I had to buy another case. Anyway good product.",

            "A Great package when I bought it for 14k. Though mono speaker yet output is very good, I mean a kind of richness is there in the output. Haptic can be improved a bit by adding haptics in various activities. Display is just very much good for the price, vibrant and visible in all scenarios.\nComing to Camera, it is just avg. in this context especially in low light even in indoor scenarios.\n\nConsidering price hike i consider it as a bit not in the great price to offering one especially aginst the likes of redmi counterparts.\n\nHaving said all these, I m pretty satisfied with the phone except that camera performance, but Gcam gave me a bit relax\n\nThanks for reading......",

I'm writing a review.\nIf you are looking for the budget centeric smart phone you can definitely go for this one..\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udc4d\nBattery will last long more than 1 day as considering casual gaming and video play back.

Camera is not good.\n2. Yes it does overheats sometimes.\n3. Ram management is horrible.\n4.

            "Best mobile I don't know why all are saying that camera is of poor quality it's really descent at this price segment and price point nothing is bad in it processor is the latest one and the best ram rkm everything is good even refresh rate charger all is amazing you get such a premium build quality and stunning design. Been using this mobile since 4days now no lags nothing one of the best.\nThankyou so much realme and thankyou so much Flipkart even I will say it's better than redmi note 10",

            "Camera is not at all good. Pics taken have grain effect\nNight mode photos are too smoothened.\nNot at all recommended for Pic-Takers.\nOn the other note, the performance is good.(no sluggish or any kind of lag)\nThe display is great coz of the super-amooled display and its literally lit.\nBattery is great and the inbox 65w charger is a boon.",

            "The phone quality in hand is very good. One can easily go for this phone who wants a fast phone day to day usage and a decent camera. The features are very good.\nThe only cons, I personally feel is the Google Dialler fo which you cannot record call automatically and a notification is told while recording a single call. It is baseless as no rules for call recording is present in India till date.\n4 GB RAM performs good for regular work. If only you are a gamer u can go for 6GB RAM varient.",

I'm using this phone from 21 days and bettary , display, and overall gaming and phone performance is very good and slightly fast than other phones (like vivo z1 pro,vivo s1, realme 7 pro and poco m2 pro). But camera is not as expected but finally after update camera is good.",
            "It's a good smartphone but the only thing that looks awkward is the DARE TO LEAP branding. Another thing that I noticed is the fingerprint sensor unlock is slow when you add a tempered glass. It's probably not the fault of the phone but the tempared glass quality. I would hope to see realme bundle it's wireless headphones or activity bandsl with smartphone to have a set of accessories at reasonable price like Samsung and Apple does. Although realme is not a premium brand but it's always good to offer accessories.\n\nCamera is good but can be even better, I liked dual camera video recording.\nBattery is big enough and with 30W brick it's easy to charge a massive 5000 MaH battery in 60 mins.\nOS looks like stock android but it's relame 2.0 OS and it's good.\n\ncall quality is not good on WiFi calling, may be it's my Jio WiFi. I've disabled it and call quality is top notch.\n\nIt serves the purpose and can easily beat other mobiles in specs. That's it folks.",

            "It has been around 1 month since I got this device...\nAnd let me detail the pros and cons:-\n1. Screen - The AMOLED is gorgeous, and has vibrant colours, and looks very good\n2. Under-display Fingerprint - It's speed is quite okay but it does lend a premium feel to the device.\n3. Size and Weight - Compared to my Poco X3, this device feels super handy, and is quite comfortable to hold and use.\n4. Battery - 5000 mAh, coupled with an AMOLED works wonders. There have been days where constantly watching movies/series for 5-6 hours is also not enough to kill the battery. Plus the charging is pretty good too\n5. Plastic Back - This might not be for everyone, but many times, my previous phone has slipped out of my hand, or been dropped, so the not-fragile plastic back has an advantage.\n6. Realme UI - Personally, I like Realme UI alot, so it's a plus for me.\n\nCons:-\n1. Camera - The camera is a hit and miss, sometimes it takes wonderful photos, other times not so much... I hope Realme is able to fix this with future updates.\n2. Processor (Maybe) - Helio G95 has been shown to overheat under some conditions, but since I don't use my device heavily, I haven't encountered this yet.\n3. Plastic Back - As I said, it depends on personal preferences... Glass might feel premium, but plastic is more drop-resistant.",

            "Its super phone within this prise range. I am giving 3 star just because the design and looks of thia model. Performance wise its best but it looks cheap like G-Five, and sigmatal type, the Chinese phones which was in indian market. Body design looks is so bad.",
            "Overall nice phone. For those who say Helio G95 heats alot, This phone heats a bit but not that much it just slightly warms up during heavy usage like BGMI,kinemaster,filmora etc. Battery backup is decent gives 1 day backup in average use. charges in just 1hrs. Some people say camera is too bad because it is Omnivision sensor but I don't think that it is too bad it captures nice and detailed photos, camera app is a slight disappointed because it boost green colour a lot and most time doesn't capture the details, so it needs improvement I think there are a lot of tools in camera app to satisfy your needs. Guys I use modded gcam and it captured photos with more detail and with natural colours. So go for a modded gcam. Display is really nice, pitch black, 1000 nits brightness makes display visible under direct sunlight. Underdisplay finger print is not very fast but it is pretty fast I never had any problem with it, it even unlocks if your finger is slighly wet. only 1 thing that is a problem is it get minor scratches even if you use back cover provided within the box",

            "This is my first realme phone. Camera is very decent and not like 64mp. Also 4gb variant is not super fast. It maybe due to lower refresh rate 60hz. Screen quality and battery performance is top notch. There are some bloatware present but you can uninstall that. Overall value for money phone in this segment.",
            "This is the only smartphone in this budget which offers an in-display fingerprint and thats why i bought it. However specs wise its descent too. Realme UI is better than MIUI for sure. Battery and charging department is excellent in this phone. Performance is also good but only problem is the 4gb ram. Finally after using it for 20 days i can say that it is recommendable under 15k without any doubt.",

Also phone is slimmer than competition with same battery.\n\nCamera: above average. 8/10: good photos for 64mp, sometimes oversaturated. Night photos are good and bright enough. You will like it's front camera as well.\n\nSoftware: full of bloats. 8/10: some are removable and some can be disabled. Overall optimization for Speed and battery is great.\n\nBattery: good. 10/10: lasted a little more than one and a half days. Charging time around an hour with a few minutes up and down.\n\nDisplay: 7/10: good display with no problem using in direct sunlight. Colours are well saturated. Amoled is this price range is rare.\n\nFingerprint: on screen. Fast. 10/10 for price range\n\nOverall this phone is good for people who play games if you get it for less than 14k",

The game centre optimises the device for a great gameplay .\n\nIn case of camera correct lightings are required for great photography but in low quality also photo is not bad . The 64mp camera is outstanding in outdoor photography .\n\nSpeakers are good they are not stereos one but the sound decoding chip plays a great role while using headphones and gives a blazing and great sound quality .\n\nOverall i liked this phone and strongly recommend it for all Low to high end users .",

Ui is smooth and stable with no bugs at all\n4. Battery and charging perfect for running all day with 6-7 hrs use time\n5. Compact easy to use with one hand\n\nCons -\n1. Camera is bad in low light and there is no stability in video recording and selfi is ok but overall 3/10\n(Samsung's camera is much better in this range like f41 or other)\n3. Don't buy 4gb ram varient go with 6gb for better performance around 15000 and not more than that . 4. Default mode is not 64 mp you have to always shift to that and the major problem of this phone - while taking photos with 64 mp mode it take long time to click and process photos this is a bug or I don't know but it's camera is slow (photos with simple photo mode and with 64 mp mode are exact same)\n2. Don't have good back cases in the market unlike samsung\n\nConclusion\nGood for those who want compact light phone with good processor for gaming and smooth scrolling and watching movies videos and clean stock ui with many customisation features (unlike samsung) and focus mode and many other features for students.\n\nIf you want good camera go for samsung in this price range",

            "Finally, I was able to purchase the realme 8 smartphone!!\n\nFirst things first, when you hold & feel the mobile phone in your hands, you will feel really sturdy and strong which is the built quality. However, it's back is a fingerprint magnet! Yeah, every time you touch it's back w/out cover, you'll see your fingerprints mark there. So, you have to use a back case while using this phone.\n\n\nTalking about camera, it's really good (thanks to the Sony IMX sensors), but the front camera clicks just decent pictures, so not expect too much from that. But I will give 5/5 in back camera.\n\nAbout its performance, well, it supports MTK G 95 processor, which runs day-to-day applications really smooth and well. Also, as \"G\" stands for gaming, you can easily rely on it when it comes to gaming. Be it COD, BGMI, Fortnite, the processor will run any of them with ease.\n\nMoreover, the mammoth 5,000 mAh baterry will easily last upto a day with normal usage (including bit of intense gaming). And the battery supports 30 Watts fast charging, which charges the battery from 0-100 within an hour.\n\nFinally, coming to it's display, it has a SUPER AMOLED Display, which is wayyy better than normal IPS LED displays out there in the market at this price range, so yeah, the phone won't let you down in this segment too!",

            "First of all I have researched a lot before buying this mobile coz I have to use it for a long term so from my experience after recieving the product what I've observed are:\n\nBATTERY: Excellent battery life, it lasts 1 day easily with playing pubg and other games for 3-4 hrs and consuming social media and some YouTube for 2-3hrs. If you are a normal user you can easily get more than 1 day\n\nCHARGING: 30W charger is bundled in the box and it gets a little bit hot depending on the room temperature and it's quite normal it takes 50-65min to completely charge my device from 15-100%.\n\nDISPLAY: As for me the display is quite good and dark mode is too good there are no issues till now.\n\nPERFORMANCE: I've played pubg on smooth+ultra settings and it ran smoothly but it ls fps fluctuates between 35-40 and don't expect 60fps but there are no frame drops or lags I've noticed few but they are due to my network. So G95 is pretty powerful chipset and makes the job done.\n\nCAMERA: Like everybody says it's camera is not upto the mark but if you are just like me who prefer performance over cameras then go for it if you want better pictures u can use g_cam anytime\ud83d\ude0a\n\nCONS: If u have purchased this mobile don't rush and update it to A13 security patch because even though it improves the camera a little bit the consumption of battery has become more so please avoid that.\nAnd add a back cover because it's back is prone to scratches easily. And it says \"don't use any other protective glass for display as it might not make ur fingerprint recognised \" so I haven't yet applied any glass on it, screen protector is pre-applied.\n\nSo, if you want a mobile for long term usage and prefer performance over cameras then you can go for it..",

Easy to focus and the clarity. 64 megapixel results area very detailed.\n\n* Build quality: very good build. Looks like a masterpiece with very asthenic built. The chrome finish in the back and the ring it makes it Bhid Main Alag. It's also very slim not expecting a battery of 5000 mah in it.\n\n* Sound: sound quality is very good. But not able distinguished any difference as it is Dirac sound.\n\n* Processor: It's very fast without any lag. The main lagging issues occurred after the mobile used for a year. As I am using Realme 5 pro which is around 2 years without any lag. So hoping it will do so as new generation processor and technology can do better.\n\n* UI: very simple and easy to use. Not complex bit like other brands. Making simple anything lots of high grade technology used.\n\n* Display: The display is Amoled. It's pleasing to watch, but not like Samsung as both have different technologies. Still one will fully satisfied.\n\nFinal Verdict: It's value for money product in the market. It will be better buy than Realme 8 5g compared to price and specifications. So go for it as I bought it in 14000/.\n\nDelivery : - I am really appreciate the fastest ever delivery by an online sites. I ordered around 9.30 pm in the night and got it in the morning 11.30 pm. It's really amazing. Even local shops won't deliver in that sort of time and gave lots of execuses.\n\nFinally I am giving thanks to Flipkart and their team for their dedicated efforts to organize such a appreciable manner with lots of obstacles they face.",

            "Firstly I Bought it at 13240 with two discount offers first is discount given by flipkart and the other one is I bought it with Sbi Credit card so there also I get discount. Talking about Mobile so if you are Looking For Camera Please Don't Buy It Because Camera is Horrible indeed, other than That The Mobile Is quit Nice Like the Super Amoled Display enhanced your day to day experience .The 5000 mah battery will be enough for 1 and 1/2 Day and if you're decent user then it will stay longer as well. After that Processor is Also Good Like You will not feel any lag or Stutter in day to day life. I played some games as well it handled it very well. I played BGMI In high Settings It Handled it Very Well their was some Stutter in game in between but it was for once or twice that's it. If camera Doesn't Matters to You Then You Shall Opt For This, You will Be Happy with it.",
