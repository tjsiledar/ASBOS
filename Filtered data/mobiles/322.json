            "Still a rocker phone.good performance in 8gb 256gb variant.has a solid camera works best with Google cam.pubg runs smooth af.i bet you will not get a better option at this price point.if you don't mind to have a 1 year old phone then go for it.",
            "I love this phone especially its camera, battery & performance! Its looking fabulous; I have armoured edition & it is outstanding! It is better option & value for money in this price with snapdragon 845 & I'm a proud owner of it; you should definitely go for it; You wouldn't get better option than this this!",
            "amazing phone poco f1 super cemra Quality very fast processor and battery backup was very very powerful this phone is super fast phone my life Best phone poco f1",
            "For the price of Rs25.5k (after offer + CC cashback), this 8GB+256GB+Kevlar back one is no-brainer.\n[1] Finally a phone, I can use without a case. The soft touch feel of kevlar is simply mind-blowing..\n[2] Android Pie 9.0 is also buttery smooth (but dis-allows hiding notch. But there natcho-notch app comes to the rescue).\n[3] Love the xiaomi's gestures to use full screen for myself, removing the nav buttons.\n[4] Battery life is also more than good for 1.5 days.\n[5] Display is awesome.\n[6] Camera is far better than my expectations.\n[7] IR cam assisted face unlock works great even in pitch dark.\n[8] finger print scanner is super fast.\n[9] Phone charges fast enough and notification LED down is a good addition as well.\n[10] Dual VoLTE works great. Supports all 4G network's VoLTE, including Airtel and Idea.\n[11] LTE+ or LTE-A or LTE Carrier aggregation works great. May be 2CA. Mostly like (Band 40+ Band 40) and (Band 3 + Band 40) combinations.\n[12] Loud Speaker and call quality is also good.",
            "TERRIFIC PURCHASE !!\n\nI still have my return period going on and this is something super amazing. I changed my S9 with this and my motive was that processors are pretty same and I didn't wanted to downgrade and was short on cash too.\n\nPros:\n1. Snapdragon 845 2.8 Gigahertz, the best in class\n2. People hate the screen but I'm in love with the same.\n3. 4000 mah battery which is amazingly tuned with the performance.\n4. Liquid Cooling System, phone barely heats up.\n5. I have the 8GB/256gb variant as compared to S9 which had only 4GB/64gb and was sloppy with just 144 apps in it. I got extra space and extra fast performance.\n6. The face recognition is just amazing, unlocks the phone even in the complete darkness.\n7. Adreno 630 which I had same in Galaxy S9.\n\nCons:\n1. MiUI just because I love stock android/OneUI\n2. Camera is okayish and could be amazing, wil start to use GoogleCam for the same.\n3. Need to tweak the UI a little bit.\n4. Netflix Certification not provided to forget to watch the same in HD.\n\nVerdict:\n1. For UI related stuff, kindly get \"Rootless Pixel Launcher\". (temporary stock android feel+no ads)\n2. For screen, kindly get \"Matte Screen Guard\", touches improve over time.\n3. Don't get hard case, can end up putting scratches at the back. (get a leather case)\n4. As compared to OnePlus 6 / OnePlus 6T, the benchmark is higher, even higher than Samsung S9's performance.\n5. Value for money, giving up Super AMOLED does hurt, but that's fine, there's no issue like screen-bleeding, etc.\n6. UI is interactive but can be amazing if tweaked to get stock android. (trying on the same)\n7. Camera is okayish but I'm a performance loving person, for me the camera doesn't matter, the performance does.\n\n\n(WILL UPDATE MY REVIEW AFTER 30 DAYS OF USE. I LOVE POCO F1. PERFORMANCE IS BETTER THAN F2.)",
            "Camera is good\nBattery is awesome did charge for past 2 days since I bought\nArmored edition feels like rubberized back,but can't explain exactly.\nHeadphone jack has a amp.\nDisplay is good\n\nFace unlock is very fast so is the finger print scanner\nDoesn't get hot at all.\nSpeed is good but it gets even faster when I reduce the animation , tradition etc to 0.5x in developer options.\nNot even single app loaded out of memory and about 5.4 GB is free out of 8gb.\nAnd boot loader unlock is already available so I can root it immediately and load custom rom\nCons\n\nNotch is bad can't see battery percentage and notification\n\nLittle heavy\nI like the armoured edition but build might be a con\nIf you don't like using case go for armoured edition\nOr else save a thousand.\nAudio out of speaker gets distorted after 90%",
            "its beast in this price range\nlatest SDP 845 at this price range\nbetter ram mgmt 8 GB Ram variant\nFeel solid Armoured edition\nFace unlock is super fast accurate with IR even in dark\nRear Camera is awsome\nFront Camera is Awsome",
            "Video @ 4K 60fps | camera is amazing and performance is great.. I tried rendering 4K video at 4K 60fps, it crashed but it's not a negative thing, since a smartphone is finally a smartphone itself and not a pc/laptop, but it renders short videos of less than 3 minutes.. But when u edit and render at 1080p, it's wow.. Slow Mo is stunning @ 240fps & 120fps 1080p and 960fps 10sec 720p clip..\nperformance: It's awesome.

            "For the price of Rs25.5k (after offer + CC cashback), this 8GB+256GB+Kevlar back one is no-brainer.\n[1] Finally a phone, I can use without a case. The soft touch feel of kevlar is simply mind-blowing..\n[2] Android Pie 9.0 is also buttery smooth (but dis-allows hiding notch. But there natcho-notch app comes to the rescue).\n[3] Love the xiaomi's gestures to use full screen for myself, removing the nav buttons.\n[4] Battery life is also more than good for 1.5 days.\n[5] Display is awesome.\n[6] Camera is far better than my expectations.\n[7] IR cam assisted face unlock works great even in pitch dark.\n[8] finger print scanner is super fast.\n[9] Phone charges fast enough and notification LED down is a good addition as well.\n[10] Dual VoLTE works great. Supports all 4G network's VoLTE, including Airtel and Idea.\n[11] LTE+ or LTE-A or LTE Carrier aggregation works great. May be 2CA. Mostly like (Band 40+ Band 40) and (Band 3 + Band 40) combinations.\n[12] Loud Speaker and call quality is also good.",
            "TERRIFIC PURCHASE !!\n\nI still have my return period going on and this is something super amazing. I changed my S9 with this and my motive was that processors are pretty same and I didn't wanted to downgrade and was short on cash too.\n\nPros:\n1. Snapdragon 845 2.8 Gigahertz, the best in class\n2. People hate the screen but I'm in love with the same.\n3. 4000 mah battery which is amazingly tuned with the performance.\n4. Liquid Cooling System, phone barely heats up.\n5. I have the 8GB/256gb variant as compared to S9 which had only 4GB/64gb and was sloppy with just 144 apps in it. I got extra space and extra fast performance.\n6. The face recognition is just amazing, unlocks the phone even in the complete darkness.\n7. Adreno 630 which I had same in Galaxy S9.\n\nCons:\n1. MiUI just because I love stock android/OneUI\n2. Camera is okayish and could be amazing, wil start to use GoogleCam for the same.\n3. Need to tweak the UI a little bit.\n4. Netflix Certification not provided to forget to watch the same in HD.\n\nVerdict:\n1. For UI related stuff, kindly get \"Rootless Pixel Launcher\". (temporary stock android feel+no ads)\n2. For screen, kindly get \"Matte Screen Guard\", touches improve over time.\n3. Don't get hard case, can end up putting scratches at the back. (get a leather case)\n4. As compared to OnePlus 6 / OnePlus 6T, the benchmark is higher, even higher than Samsung S9's performance.\n5. Value for money, giving up Super AMOLED does hurt, but that's fine, there's no issue like screen-bleeding, etc.\n6. UI is interactive but can be amazing if tweaked to get stock android. (trying on the same)\n7. Camera is okayish but I'm a performance loving person, for me the camera doesn't matter, the performance does.\n\n\n(WILL UPDATE MY REVIEW AFTER 30 DAYS OF USE. I LOVE POCO F1. PERFORMANCE IS BETTER THAN F2.)",

            "I got the 8gb RAM/256gb ROM Armored edition variant. I am really starting to love the phone at this price point. Here's my pros, cons, could be better:\nPros:\nPerformance: This phone is a BEAST with Snapdragon 845 chipset. Graphics intensive PUBG game ran super smooth with all high settings. I saw this as a single most point as worth buying under this price along with high RAM. Liquid cooling tech really kept the back of phone from heating at all.\nBattery: Big on battery 4000mah. Not a 2-day battery but I could still see around 23% charge remaining after a full day use. Impressive!\nDisplay: An FHD IPS display yet feels somewhat AMOLED like with vibrant colours and sharp images. Don't expect Galaxy S9 flagship like display though!\nMiUi 10: Comes with Android Oreo. Phone was shipped with MiUi 9 skin which I didn't like at first as I heard there were quite some issues with it. But MiUi 10 is available to update and it has fixed most of the issues and made the UI more sleek, simple and modern. A big thumbs up for that. Android Pie should be available in coming months.\nCamera: I expected Poco to cut the corners in camera section. But I don't think it's that bad at all. Instead I felt the 12mp+5mp rear dual camera was quite good enough under good light conditions. Some noise creeped in during low light shots but I found photos decent enough. selfie camera came with 20mp and it's AI did a fair job in portrait mode.\nFingerprint sensor: Blazing fast. Trust me!\nFace ID: Didn't try because of Fingerprint sensor.\n\nCons:\nHybrid Sim: Its either 2 sim cards OR 1 sim + 1 SD card! My old Moto X Play supported all 3 at once. Hence I went with the 256gb variant.\nThe Infamous display Notch: Yeah I know it looks stylish & premium and all. But I wished the 2 notches could have been a bit more wider so it could accommodate at least some notification icons.\nNo HD content in Netflix and Prime: Yes! you heard that right! This is due to something known as DRM and a phone needs L1 certification to play 1080p on streaming services. Xiaomi unfortunately has L3. So you will be able to play only upto 540p videos which I feel is still manageable for me because I don't do a lot of Netflix/Prime.\nI am however a YouTube junkie and I'm glad YouTube runs on 1080p.\n\nCould be improved:\nProviding Google now launcher support: Currently shows it isn't compatible in playstore. I am a fan of stock android experience. Simple design, just feels fast and right to use, no bloatwares etc. MiUi 10 isn't bad itself considering how much it has improved over time. But the Mi bloatwares still persist. Some may be useful, some may not.\nBuild: I own the armoured version which comes with Kevlar finish back which looks cool. Surrounding it is still plastic. But It does feel very good and solidly built in hand.\nNo NFC: This tech is used for Android Pay in supermarkets of the west. But it's not prominent in India yet. So I'm okay with it being not there.\nScreen rounded too much at the bottom corners. That's quite some screen real estate shaved off.\n\nI perfectly understand Poco cutting some corners here and there for that aggressive price range they are selling but I'm so much thankful to them not doing it in the areas where it mattered the most.\n\nSo Should you buy it?? If you are thinking of mainly budget and performance then I honestly cannot think of any other phone, but just this one. Just go for it!",

Everything is good in this phone but the battery consumption is a bit faster. I don't know if it's due to any installed apps or settings. Anther thing is in camera. I don't know but I felt that my 64 gb varient produced better photos. Apart from these minor issues ( I don't know. It may be my own fault.) Everything thing is awesome. Even I bought 3 phones. ( Other 2 for my relatives who liked my phone and ordered)",

            "I bought at the time when the predecessor was about to be launched, the poco x2. The reason why i chose this one over x2 is because poco f1 at Rs.16500 is a terrific value for money buy. You get the SD 845 which was the flagship processor once and still hold strong against the recent low end versions. Plus you get 8 gb ram and 256 gb storage which is a bomb at this price tag. Its still a great option for those who looking for a strong performer at a low budget and not really interested in showing off the newly launced gadgets.",

            "This phone is superb. In the Republic sale, I got this phone for 15.5 K for 8GB / 256 GB and believe me its super-duper excellent for this price. Even the recently matched X2 won't be able to match the speed with this Poco X1 845 processor.\n\nBut one thing to note, the manufactured date I got for this phone was of Sep 2018, so its a 1 1/2-year-old phone. Please note that.\n\nBut with the flagship processor, you get flagship performance in terms of Cellular connectivity, Wifi Connectivity, camera performance, and all those nitty-gritty details.\n\nOne thing for sure, you cannot get 8GB / 256 GB for the price. And of course, this review is for the people who are satisfied with the performance of the phone rather than showing off. If you are of the Show off type, you can buy new non-flagship phones at prices costlier than this Poco F1\n\nThe software update is latest on the phone, Offers Vo-WiFi calling. Camera performance is excellent, device response is snap.\n\nGo for it if Purely performance is what matters to you most, you cannot get a better device than this phone with the specs for this price",
            "Pros:\nYou can't get a better performing phone cheaper then this, with apps and whatsapp videos taking so much storage 256gb is good option for the price. Performance and battery life is good, phone feels snappy and touch response is good.\n\nIt also has headphone jack so you can charge and listen to music at the same time.\n\nCons:\nDisplay has a big notch which in some games cover buttons and overall make it look cheap.\n\nYou can't customize the back, home and task manager buttons or hide them and use gestures like oppo phones.\n\nOverall:\nif you are a heavy user who needs his phone to store a lot of data, use whatsapp extensively for sharing photos and videos.. just get this phone..\n\nFor gamers better buy something without a notch or atleast a smaller one.",
            "Phone is amazing, super fast and display is vivid.. but camera could be lot better as photos and videos are not that crisp. I was disappointed to see no earphones with the top model I bought. If we are paying 30k we expect basic stereo earphones with the phone. Phone is a little on the heavier side as I m not used to it but it is expected because of the battery. I used this phone all day and its fast even than an i phone. Rest I will know after using this phone for more than a month.",
            "poco f1is awesome in all aspects, especially its look.\nMany Tech Reviwers and many people said that look n design is okok, but as per my opinion, build quality is best and surely it gives premium feel and its blue color looks very beauti full in hand.Also thanks to flipcart to deliver on 3rd day.All over, phone is best in todays market,must buy,full value for money,thums up to xiomi for snd845.",

It get quite hot sometimes while charging or in sunlight with max brightness, but that's expected from any phone\n\nI would say go for other offerings in the market if you want a good display.",

But if you are not a heavy user it will last you 2 days. Screen on time at first was 8 hrs straight, now its 6 hours.(I am a really heavy user). For those of you who ask about PUBG (Its Really Really good). Battery consumption is visible after 20 months and a few updates. I think updates make the phone use more battery.\nNever gets hot if you don't use camera for 2 hours. Decent brightness 70% visible under direct sunlight.\nBeautiful screen colours are accurate. Not as good as samsung but respectable\nPerformance and storage is never an issue. SD845 is more than capable.\nIf you wanna buy this product its very capable and there is none other than this in its category. Its for steal price now.

            "I am using my POCO F1 for last 6 months. This phone is absolute beast you can do anything thing seamlessly from clicking photographs to playing games.\n\nPros:\n1. Camera\nIt is a flagship quality you can take awesome photo using the default cam app. You can even install gcam for better photographs.\n2. RAM\n8 Gb ram makes your day to day work easy with it you get a better ram management.\n3. Storage\nWith 256Gb of internal storage you have worry less about running out of storage space anytime soon.\n4. Looks\nits quite basic if you compare it with the phones launch in past year but it is sturdy an survive fall from upto few feet . The Kevlar back panel gives it a premium look. It is quite big phone if you have never used a phone with a over 5 inch screen\n5. Display\nThe colors are very vibrant and has sharp display. Everything in screen looks detail. Good for watching movies and playing games. The touch response is smooth with quick reaction times\n6. Battery\n4000mah is quite decent if you are regular user it will definitely last for a day. But with gaming it will last for about variable time if you are a hardcore mobile gaming lover. So you have to recharge your phone often. Type C fast charging is available so charging is pretty fast you can expect 0 - 100% in about 1hr 30 mins or may be less mine takes about an hour.\n7. Gaming\nIf your a mobile gaming enthusiast. This is definitely the deal for your. Without any hesitation you can opt for this device. You will not be disappointed. Believe me.\n\nCons:\n\nIt might be hard to believe but so far no cons have been found by me. For me it exceeds expectations.\nThe best phone one could wish for.",

The product was lying at my nearest hub for 2days but it was not delivered in the promised time in spite of several requests.\nIt was even surprising to know that Flipkart support desk doesn't have any control and contact with it's own courier partner Ekart Logistics. It's pathetic logistic arrangement.\n\n4 stars for POCO F1:\nAmazing product at this price.\n\nI have used several other MI products on the last email years including MI6, Redmi Note 3, Note 5, Y2 but the feel of the Poco is far more superior and smooth that the others.\n\nI have also used One plus products and can clearly see a tough competition to the one plus 6.\nPoco F1 is:\nvery responsive\neasy to navigate\nLong battery life\nGood camera phone\n\nPoco launcher is good but some may not like it\nThe in box phone back cover is something that I don't like. It's very smooth slippery. In fact the Kevlar back feels much confident and soft to hold but not doesn't tend to slip from the hand.\n\nSome things I don't like are,\n- we cannot make folder to group apps, so Everytime we have to scroll through all the app.\n- Search doesn't work very well on the phone.\n- the camera performance in the night, especially when you are shooting with a bright background is not good. It's noisy.\n- The screen has light bleeding around it, which looks cheap.\n- the full screen display mode is not actually full screen and the large notch intrudes into your full screen videos.\n- the notification light color is not customizable, I think this should be improved in further patches and updates.",

The design has its own aesthetic.\nAlso, if you know a thing or two about how to handle camera, exposure, adjust framings you can click some nice shots.\nIm short, install Gcam right away.\n\nElse, this phone is butter.\nHope my review has helped.",
            "This is awosome product I think one of the best mobile with best quality and doing his work very well.......and I am very happy for mobile......see this pic",
            "Delivered before given date. I was expecting cheap looks and ok display, because of the reviews. But when I opened the box. I was amazed. People just compare this to glass back phones.\nawesome looks (only on armoured edition).\nDisplay is very good as it's Just ips lcd.\nLatest miui software is very fluid. And bloat free.\nPerformance is top notch.\nStock camera is good. But with gcam you can have awesome pictures.\nAnd don't buy tempered glass online. Just buy one in market. Cost less than half the price what you pay online.\nAnd if you are planning on buying mid range phone. Like poco f2 or other. Then you should go for this flagship killer. It has a lot of developer support when it comes to custom roms.",
            "This is the best phone for this price range....\nExcellent performance and also good camera.\nPoco X2 is just a gimmick, bought this instead of poco X2 because of the better chipset and also storage........",
            "Good smartphone. Play heavy game apps like PUBG and asphalt 9 and many more hundreds of apps efficiently without heating. Problem with screen bleeding, yes you cannot do anything about it as it is a LCD display it has that problem, also seen the same problem with Mi Redmi Note 6 Pro!!! Rest is all good. Enjoy",
            "The phone is performing pretty good as off now after 6 months... Sometimes while playing games (pubg/cod) the battery drains a bit faster but that's an issue with every phone... Its worth buying if you are looking for a good budget smartphones... In 2020 aswell.... Plus the fast charging is brilliant... Thumbs up.",
            "It's a wonderful phone. SD 845 with 8 /256 combination works just perfect for me. Even after launch( way back in 2018 ) this Phone is receving updates. Feb 2020 security patch with android 10 is awesome.If you want performance oriented phone and you are ready to compromise little on camera then this one is best choice for you.",
            "Unbelievable camera. Pictures won't pixelate when you zoom to maximum in PC.\nI came to know that Megapixel of cameras are just only numbers. Don't compare the dumb phone cameras like Oppo Vivo with this.\nLow light camera is also too good.\nUltra smooth operation. You will feel like using an apple iPhone.\nDisplay not best but very good in this price range.\nSpeakers are louder as compared to other xiomi phones.\nCOD and PUBG gameplay just outstanding. Bole to ek dum makhhan.",
            "I have used many Phones recently from iPhone to Samsung from MI to Oppo.I could say that Poco f1 is a quality launch from MI .Ok Let me start from the beginning .After I purchased the phone on Flipkart which was super fast as usual Filpkart sent me ab thousand updates on when the phone will Reach .Flipkart proved to faster than usual and the I received the phone in an excellently packed manner and delivered 3days before delivery date.So Thanks Flipkart.\nNow About Phone .The Phone come well Packed with All Documents ,Charging Cable and 3.0Fast Charger.The phone startup is excellent fast take 2to 3 seconds to boot up.Screen resolution and Resolution is perfect with all necessary pre installed apps.Most of the Apps are already pre installed on Phone .\ncamera .20 at rear and 20 at front also gives great clarity pics specially when the same is transferred to your big screen TV or Laptop.\nBattery is family decent for gaming dudes and long talkers and few minutes changing will give enough to last for a couple of Hours.\n8gb Ram 256 GB memory .Firmware use 10Gb rest is free and expandable to further 256gb . 8gb Ram with 845 Snapdragon is really fast .You never feel lag on graphics or high resolution Blu-ray videos .YouTube Videos in HD quality plays well with good depth in quality.I overall recommend specially for price vs spec.",
            "Delivery on time greatful experience with ekart boy and flipkart.\nProduct was good condition.\nPoco F1 great phone in this great price.\nonly build quality is not good other's things very awesome.",
            "the phone doesn't work good on speaker, the voice breaks when we use speaker. The volume control function automatically stops working any time. when we restart then it works, if u dial a number and that number doesn't connects , it doesn't convey any mesaage like it is out of range, busy or switched off, just a big blank comes. so these are the major issue, not value,for money , one plus in this range is much much better than this phone as i m using both.",
            "One of the best budget phone at the given price , performance at par with the best available today, but compromise on camera, UI and display. Can't expect or ask for more at less than half the price of note 9 or any other SD845 with 8 GB of RAM and 256 GB storage with 4000 mah battery giving more than a day of usage with aggressive use.",
            "awesome phone by xiaomi..i love it..display is nice but the notch is big...nice battery back up. charging is faster than my redmi note 3..4000 mamp battery. so once u charge at night , u can use it full day without any hesitation...it doesn't get hot like my redmi note3...front camera just awesome...rear cam could be better...enough internal memory....overall love it",
            "Every one knows what Poco F1 is capable of, I going to show you what it can do in extremely dark condition,\nThe pic i have attached is shot by Poco F1 with regular camera app, Gcam 7.3 night mode on & Gcam 7.3 Astro mode on.\nIn astro mode the pic is almost 0 grainy full of details but sometimes it take even 5 mins to shot one pic & u need to keep the phone so steady that it is on a tripod but the results are worth for wait i guarantee you.\nSelfie is good.\nSound is loud with stereo effect.\nScreen is average not that bad at all for ips lcd screen.\nPerformance is like boss.\nMiui is featuristic but have bugs & there is no ads while i saw 2 times ads in 10 days of my use & that is with Mi video or Mi apps.\n\nCon-\nThe only con i feel is battery backup & Charging speed is good but yet not so fast.\n\nFinal verdict-\nBest value for money at this price, U can take it without thinking but only if you a device under 20k with a good processor, bcoz u'll get a lot & much better features from other devices like Poco X2, Realme X2.\nPOCO F1 standsout with 845 processor only.",
            "Good enough for 2019. Haven't faced any screen bleeding issues as such, but I do occasionally get an unresponsive touch once in a while. The notch is huge and takes time to get used to, but it works well. Performance is really awesome, much better than some other phones in this price range. An older flagship killer is any day faster and better than a current day mid range phone. Network quality is superb, LTE 3CA improves the network significantly. Overall pretty awesome phone.",
            "I installed the pixel 3 camera software the moment I received the device. you can do that later but It requires rebooting the device, rebooting your device would mean losing all your data. I did this because I love the way pixel phones take stunning pictures while keeping the Color as natural as possible .\n\npro: Fast- no lags, good battery, storage n processor, camera (with pixel 3 camera software installed,my preference), one hand usability.\n\ncons- xiaomi skin on Android, notch, (wish it was amoled), plastic build.\n\nfinal word- nothing else is better if the budget is 23k, no regrets buying this. happy in 2019",
            "Undoubtedly the best smartphone I ever had. hands down,the best features for such price. AI camera is really good. no blurry images and editing options. super fast processor and best battery life. Didn't come as a surprise as I'm a proud owner of mi max 2 that has an amazing battery. Really glad i bought this phone. worth every rupee paid.",
            "Feels good in hand.\nLooks really good in hand rather than seeing it in reviews in hand.\nThis phone will last you more than 2 years if kept properly.\nSturdy phone.\nAlthough get a screen protector and a case for reassurance.\nTHIS IS THE ALMOST PERFECT BUDGET PHONE.\nThe best one in the market.",
            "Everything's fine but there's one thing that I need to address right now since the device comes with an Infrared Face Unlock\ud83d\udd13, it has got to have some kind of 'AniMoji' or 'PocoMoji' which I believe will be present in a future update very soon. We will get to see the full potential of this young lion by Q4 of 2018 like EIS on the front camera, better RAM Management, improve battery life, higher benchmark scores to the already powerful top of the line Flagship processor known as the Snapdragon 845 soc, better speed when transferring files, more details when capturing images under low lighting conditions, Electronic Image Stabilization on 4k videos or maybe 4k 2160@60fps, etc. I Just cannot wait for MIUI 10 based Android 9.0 Pie update, yeah let's talk about it. PS: Watching Netflix or Amazon Prime videos in 480 pixel on a smartphone is not a con or a deal breaker by any means.",
            "Hi All,\nI was very lucky to order this on the first flash sale on 5tth Sept and am thrilled to lay my hands on the Poco F1 Armoured Edition 8 GB 256 GB.\nEverything about this is OSUM. Full Charging from zero to cent percent takes about 2.5 hours, Both front and rear Cameras are very good, battery lasts for nearlly two days after reasonable moderate to heavy usage, with voice and data, back plastic cover, though cheap fits in tight, response time is too good. Only negative is Jio has not given the assured 100 rs vouchers and double data on Poco F1. Otherwise, all too good. Buy it with eyes closed, and you wont regret. This is the best flagship product till date, feature packed at this price. Njoy.",

I booked it in the first sale on 05th Sept., 2018 itself. During the introductory video posted by Xiaomi POCO F1 team, an aluminium travel box was promised, I mean this mobile was suppose to come in that aluminium suitcase, which I have not received. Kindly guide whether it will come in due course or it is to be claimed online. I mean there is no clarity.",
            "Good phone as per price\nBut pretty outdated specs as compared to latest devices\n\nI took it solely for PUBG Mobile (Competitive)\nIt heats a little bit and minor touch issues.\n\nFor Competitive PUBG players: Go for better SD855 Phones if budget allows\nFor non Competitive players: It works just smooth",

            "I found it to be supreme product. it had excellent battery life, all the features Mi Xiaomi has to offer. I had used a OnePlus 6 before this and this one was better for a slightly cheaper price",

Already have 6gb 128 and now bought armoured 8gb 256 one.. Happy to use this one.. The beast mobile.. No lags no issues.. Battery charges ultimately in just 40 mins.. Full charge.. And camera also best..",

            "Good phone with great processor. I purchased this phone on sale at 155000/- now i am using it from last 9months. this phone really xiaomi's great phone ever.i am very happy with this phone",
            "At this price segment it's worth it but considering the effect its Chinese nd it's UI which is Xiaomi's ui is not as good as stock android or oxigen os or TouchWiz ui but still it's good",
            "For the purpose I bought this phone was gaming. And this phone seem to be a perfect extreme gaming phone in budget. Although, the company provided Snapdragon 845, which is premium range CPU, for heavy gaming, but sacrificed other aspects of phone like camera, body, and screen. Which is understandable. My purpose was gaming so it seem to be solved. Camera is also pretty decent though but you can't match camera with premium range phones. Image will be little contrasty.",
            "One word.Fast.\nThe phone is simply amazing.I got the 256 gb variant,and the phone performs awesome in every task.It feels like a flagship in performance and battery.Like it should.The phone a headphone jack which a plus.Design wise, its not at all bad.Actually it feels pretty good in hands.Nice display.Its not too tall.It has a nice rectangular shape.Only cons of this phone is that it has the MiUI.",

            "I am using this phone for 2 months. Its 8GB RAM and 256 GB internal variant. During this two month i must say the performance of the phone is pretty decent,there is no lag at all in the performance in terms of playing games running applications toggling between the apps. Performance wise experience is super smooth, I like it's display also but it's not an amoled display so you should not expect much. Regarding the camera it gives you decent photo but you need to know how to use Snapseed so that you can bring out the best out of it. Overall I would suggest you to buy this phone only if you are looking for a good performance but if you want to phone where you can take good pictures this phone is definitely not for you.",
            "Review after 5 months performance-This is one of the best phone available at 17k.

            "i bought this phone 2,3 days before iam satisfied with this phone...the booting is so fast...after miui 11 update the entire menu has been changed..with new additional features..\n\nDisplay :- it is average as compared to other phone displays..i was using sony z5 premium it's 4k display..so i am not satisfied with it..but notch and the all other things are good ..especially for pubg players .you guys can use the hd graphics mode..and the videos are very good to see in this...don't expect more...\n\n\nCamera :- According to camera after miui 11 upadate it's awesome..it's so good in daylight..Especially the videos captured in 4k mode is soooo good ..it has high stabilization..without any kinds of micro lags...and the sound is awesome ..one of my friend compared it with realme xt , the phone has 64 mp camera...it shows a huge problems while capturing 4k video ..while capturing it showed some lag issues ( hang slightly) it has low stabilization...may be because of it's processor ..\n\nThe camera of pocco is superb you will not be dissatisfied with this...especially for hd or above hd (4k ) videos.....the front camera is not at all good....it's too bad after the upadate ( in my view )..same time flash is dual and it is awesome in dark and low light...use google.cam for far better pics.\n\n\n\nBattery :- The battery is 4000mah with quick charger 3.0 ..before update it took 1hr 57 min something for charging..while it was\" on 'with using internet...but after the miui 11 upadate ..it takes less than 1hr 15 mins something or something while it was in \"off \" ...and same time after the full charge i wasn't turned the internet off ..it stayed more than 1 days after the full use of playing pubg , internet browsing and streaming videos....after this charge 17 % ...definitely it has a very good backup ..especially while gaming if you use game turbo mode..you guys feel some more better it makes your gaming comfort and stable..use DND mode while gaming for good backup..\n\n\nBody :- these armoured edition's body is far far better than other plastic body and the look is awesome...as compared to other you will definitely love this. because it's like a rubbered body...so kindly buy this armoured edition if you can...\n\n\nProcessor :- for this rate the snapdragon 845 processor is valuable..because it's so smooth and faster while using....i think because of this they made display a little bit bad..for making this phone valuable for money..they must compensate some features.. they took display.for that....every phone is not perfect in all it's feature..there will be some problems..but it's not a big issue on the case of pocco...Heating issue will be there if we use it under sunlight \ud83d\ude05..a very little heat will show while we are playing game for many hours..it's not a big problem...because it cools down very fast if we close all these games..because of liquid cooling system....\n\nthe performance is awesome because of SD 845 ...\n\n\n\nIR FACE UNLOCK :- it is one of the highlight feature in this phone because ..it's so fast and ..no other phone in this rate has these ..i think ....even in dark it unlocks very fast it made me wondered..(wow) ....even k20 pro doesn't has that feature the latest flagship phone having SD 855 with oled display and pop up cam...it's display is huge as compared to samsung A70, it has high RGB display...poco is best...in this IR at this rate.\n\n\n\nSound :- it is also good with dual speakers one at top and one at down..sound quality is good...",

In big diwali sale, i got this 8GB-256 GB combo phone at effective price of 16250 only.\n\nCamera may not be superfluous, but it captures best natural image with great details in all ambiences. Few of other phone with more MP although claims to be better but if you like natural original shade pics, you will love it. Many mid range mobile phone cameras are often sharpening the pics too much losing their natural color and shades\n\nLot has been said about its great performance which i will not add further - all things are absolutely correct.\n\nThe Armature version is good to look from back too.\n\nJust go for it !!!",

This is main for gaming purpose for gaming users this phone is extraordinary for them..they can go blindly for this phone with the low budget..\n\n4. Im loving this device i suggest to go without any doubt for this device if ur searching in the low budget with more features....",

The mobile is really fast, and features like face unlock works fine.\n\nThe only regret was with the long lead time after i placed the order, but looks like this years Big Billion Sale was really a hit, that might have taken a bit of time to deliver all the orders.\n\nOverall happy with the purchase. If you are a normal user who uses phone for calling, sms , whatsapp, videos, etc. then it is a great purchase, simply go for it.",

            "It's a super phone with all good features. The camera works well in daylight conditions. I bought the top version but would ask others to go for 128 GB storage max. It makes little sense to spend so much on a device which is evolving so rapidly.",
            "Well where do I start with this phone. There are so many good things to talk about Poco F1.\n1.Rear Camera - The inbuilt camera app itself comes with so many features (panaroma, portrait, manual, slow Mo, night mode) and the picture quality is amazing. Night mode is something that caught my attention as it really picks up the colours brilliantly even at low light.\n2.Front camera - A really great selfie camera for pictures and video calling.\n3.Performance - Well you can expect the phone to function as an 8 GB ram phone with me not facing a single lag issue.\n4.Battery - Takes up to 1.5 hrs to charge upto 99% and the phone even at high activity range, lasts you the entire day. I am really impressed by the battery life for video playback.\n5.Speaker - In the absence of a portable speaker it is quite impressive to even enjoy music on the phone speaker. High volume causes a little irritation but at a normal volume the inbuilt speaker is really great.\n6.UI - The UI is the standard MI UI which is quite easy to use and also looks attractive.\n7.Display - The screen being a LCD display, it still has really great colour density and clarity. To be honest I have dropped my phone a couple of times but still not a single crack or scratch, regardless of me not using a scratch guard. Would recommend using a phone protection cover to be safe.\n\nFew bugs still need to be fixed in the UI and also not completely satisfied with the portrait mode on the camera app.",

            "So I am myself a pubg player and i bought this cellphone so i can play games on it , i think it has been around 2 weeks since i got the phone now . So regarding the purpose that i have bought this phone for is going excellenct , Some of the excellect features that the phone have\n\nCamera =) If you will compare it with the phones you can buy in this price it has an excellent camera , with a 20 mp front camera that gives you clearer selfies than ever . and the Dual cameras at the back really has an amazing picture quality.\n\nProcessor =) The phone is running on snapdragon 845 processor which is the best one is the market so far , and with a 8 GB of ram with that I dont remeber myself ever lagging in game , for pubg players you really dont get that much of a render Lag and can play really well with claw on the phone.\n\nBattery =) It has an amazing battery i have myself played about 8-9 pubg games for my battery to go down from 100 to 15% somewhere , It does not comes with a dash charging but it does support fast charging technology which can easily charge the phone from 0 to 100 in 1 and 1/2 hours aproximately.\n\nDisplay =) If u compare the phone display with recent flagship One Plus 6t launched with it , the only diffrence that u get spending around 20 k more on one + is that the screen is a lil more brighter and vibrant . The phone has an HD display which gives you an amazing picture quality . I guarantee u will not die to snakes anymore.\n\nIf u like the review dont forgot to drop a like.\nPEACE OUT .",
            "Reviewing with my new phone it's awesome . performence is awesome and camera is also good overall the phone os awesome",
            "I'm extremely pleased with the performance of phone. The UI is much better than standard MiUI. Lack of HD playback on Netflix and other streaming services was a let down. Battery backup should've been better for the numbers. Fast charge is very welcome addition. Camera could have done a little better with atleast EIS but at the price is very capable. The tempered glass included in the buying offer is of very cheap quality,ill fitting and felt like wasted 200\u20b9. The armoured edition feels very exquisite and of premium finish,and if it were water and dust resistant it would be shame to hide it in bumper case. Poco live's up to it's moto of speed.

            "I got high end (Armoured version of 8GB/256GB) on 15th Sep; using it extensively since then. I would rate 10 / 10 for this amzaing POCO phone. ((Only disappointment is the way JIO offer is bundled - they have documented 10 pages of terms & conditions but not simple two lines of how exactly one should avail the JIO offer. I recharged JIO with Rs. 399/- and lost out offer worth Rs. 8K - as apparently they are particular on Rs.299/- recharge, not anything more. Went around with Flipkart & JIO support for sometime and dropped it as the effort was not worth)) One can buy these POCO phones closing eyes - they are just awesome. Initially I was apprehensive with news of screen bleeding etc but went ahead and ordered this, very happy with the decision. Absolutely no issues with the screen - it is clear & bright. plays all videos smoothly. 4000 mAH battery, excelent grip in hand while using the mobile (no fear of mobile getting dropped), superfast Snapdragn 845 (Outlook mobile, VPN apps etc opens at the touch of fingerprint) etc. I am still struggling to keep DATA active while on VOICE calls (with dual SIMs installed, configured seperately for Voice & Data) if anyone has a solution - let me know (Voice & Data work well - all together in Iphones with single SIM, perplexed to see why it is not wokring in this dual SIM andriod phone, each dedicated seperately for voice & data). Overall, thank you Mi, Thank you POCO and not to forget, good job FlipKart!!",
            "Excellent phone with best specifications and performance. Flipkart only made it available as MI store was not working on the flash sale day. Amazing fast delivery on the next day.\ud83d\udc4d",

I wanted the polycorbonate one (8 GB + 256 GB - 28999) to save 1K but they didnt sell that untill now so I had to buy Kevlar version. It feels good in hand.\nPhone is runs really fast and smooth. Heating will go away in minutes by liquid cool - a great feature.\nbattery life is damn good. And Fast charge is also there. Just go for this!",
            "this was Awesome product.the look and feel in the hand is very premium. but have return it back.cause due the packing the mobile glass was broken. thanks to flip kart the product was returned the amount was credit back in few days. seems they should give a tempered glass pretty fitted to the \ud83d\udcf1 phone like Vivo is doing it",
            "One of the best Smartphones available in the market...and that too at an affordable price! 8GBRAM/256GBMemory/4000mAh Battery! What more to ask. The call quality and photo (daylight, portrait, low light) are all comparable to any of the \"Super\" expensive smartphones available in the market. With 2.8GHz of CPU speed most of the apps work at super speed. The finger print access and the face recognition (IR) is blazing fast! This phone is one complete package!",

Inbulit FM pathetic. speaker sound average. camera is average. configuration wise very good. you can install more apps, and you will have more space for storage. It doesn't matter if its armored edition or not, as you still b needing good back cover to hold phone smoothly in hand. The free cover comes will soon turn in pathetic yellow. As usual same Sim tray that allow either 2Sim or 1Sim with extended memory card. In this price its still okay.",
            "I purchased this product in good faith and soon enough trouble started. It works only with my male deep bass low frequency voice. When my wife speaks, the calls have drops, with her voice cut out! How can one live with a shoddy product like this!? Next, it has problems in connecting via a USB cable with my Macbook Pro.File transfer does not work.The solutions offered by Xiomi service point at Kalkaji Main market downgraded the connection from top level 4G to 3G. Still the problem persists. The simple Samsung mobile purchased in 2016 works without a hitch. No such problems. Costed only around INR 7,500!",
            "One major problem, at least for me is that, it doesn't support google now/google assistant voice feature: \"Okay Google\". Other users also have reported that it also doesn't allow to use google now launcher, it prompts the message as \"Your device doesn't support this feature\". so if you want to trigger google assistant you have to long press the home button (Again, if you are using the full screen gestures mode, there is no home button of the screen). Although recent updates in the MI issues page shows that the developers have addressed this issue and have said that they will solve it in the coming software updates.\n\nSecondly, there is no option to disable notch in some apps e.i. the apps which are categorized as \"optimized for full screen mode\". But some apps(games) like PUBG Mobile are definitely not optimized for this, a significant amount of portion of gameplay is hindered by the notch, and we cannot do anything about it.\n\nI know these can be solved through software updates, but when the updates will be released is still a mystery :p\n\nOther than these the phone is awesome !",

It was a fortunate coincidence that i found out about this beautiful beast. When i saw this first time i was shocked to see such a wonderful device could match redmi.

Best phone because non of the brand would offer you such specifications at this price. Each and every mobile phone has been designed such that one or two specs or feature would be missing and this strategy is due the reason that customers would feel incomplete while using current device due to lack of few features. And customer would be waiting for new phone and this becomes continuous process. But in case of POCO F1, there is nothing left behind. The problem with xiaomi phones used to be its hybrid slim slot. But this time you have 256 GB, hybrid? who cares? Let me explain with pros and cons.\n\nPros-\n1) Camera- Equivalent to MiA2, Mi A2 has camera almost equal to Iphone (kidney range phones\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23). This means you will get such camera will never disappoint you. Perfect camera set up of 12MP+5MP rear and 20MP front facing. You will get everything you dream without selling your kidney.\n2) Diplay- Crunchy. Awesome notch design.\n3)Sound- Crispy.\n4)Battery- Whole day gaming and wifi video. Real 4000 mAh battery.\n5)Storage- Hybrid slim slot. who cares? I have whopping 256 gb storage. 243 Gb available. Ram of 8Gb. Even my laptop has only 4Gb ram. No lags no hang. Do whatever you like. Ashphalt, PUB G as smooth as butter. And hero Snapdragon 845 is always there for you.\n\nNo heating at all. Liquid cooling system available.\n\nCons- Not at all.\n\nGo for it. Even 6gb+64 gb is better option.",
            "Camera:Awesome Camera best for night Photography. Manual Camera is best if u know how to use then its suprb.Slow motion video is also good.\n\nBattery: I would say the 2 best Battery backup u can get after \"Huwai Mate P20 pro\". But for this price its the No:1.nothing Can beat. Fast Charging with in 1h:20m.\n\nPerformance: The next big thing is this performance no lag,8gb ram Awesome performance.its best.\n\nDisplay:Its brightness, colour and all are good but i would say ,if its OLED display it will be awesome,but still its the best if u compare the price.\n\ni would say POCO F1 ,is a superb phone, if u compare other models like one+6t, Huwai, iPhone and all almost all the high-end features are in this phone for very low price.",

            "I have been using the phone for over 6 months and overall it's a great mid-range phone. Cannot expect more at this price range. The battery backup is good. And the back camera is great although the selfie camera's exposure is a bit too much from my point of view. Have downloaded a tons of apps and still it runs smooth, no lags. To top it all a great phone and a absolute great purchase from flipkart",

Friends having A50 bought a year back, their phone's display has turned yellowish, I mean not like a newly purchased A50. IPS panel is atleast consistent in display.\nCamera is pretty good. Have seen camera on oneplus 7t, I don't like that. Pixelated and awful when zoomed. Thats not the case with F1, clean and with gcam it's gorgeous. But they should have made the photo editing tool like in iOS.\nSpeakers are good and loud. I don't see much movies but on whatsapp video call everyone in room can hear what one is saying from other side.\nI also like the lighting fast fingerprint sensor and IR front camera that unlocks in pitch dark that too super fast.\nBattery is good.

Battery life is excellent. It last around 25-27 hours after full charge where I have used it to watch movies and videos around 4 hours, 3-4 of internet browsing.\n\nCamera is very good. It takes some time to focus, if its focused properly then it will gove you stunnig photos. Low light photography takes more time to focus. If object is moving fast then camera does not give good photos. At this point still my Samsung Galaxy Note 5 gives me good clear and crisp photos. Dual camera gives you some stunnig photography. Front camera is also very good. In complete dark when you take selfie the display turns whole orange and at it full brightness act like a front flash and it gives you very clear photos.\n\nSound quality is very rich n clear. Ear speaker acts like secondery loud speaker. It is not so loud but works fine.\n3.5 mm jack is a huge bonus now a days. I use Soundmagic E10C and Sennheiser cx180 with it and I am very satisfied with performance.\n\nFace unlock feature works quickly in any light condition. But I never used it more then 1-3 days. Finger scanner positioned perfectly and that to works very fast.\n\nMany storage options available and there is also memory card slot thats a huge bonus to have in dual sim phones.\n\nDisplay is sharp and auto brightness is bit slow to react but dont give you so much pain in day to day use.",

            "Ordered the phone in October, 2019 yes a phone which was launched in 2018. I've opted for 8/256 (armored edition) variant. Firstly, deal felt nice as Flipkart exchange was offering decent price for my old Redmi Note 4, so I ordered it at first. But later on delivery guy who came over to pick up the old phone and deliver this beast, rejected my exchange without any reason and I had to pay additional bucks to get delivery. So experience for buying from Flipkart was worst ever. Now for phone (after 3 week usage)\nPros -\n1. SD 845 - it's truly a beast\n2. Battery\n3. Camera (especially with google camera)\n4. IR face unlock\n5. Plenty of storage\n6. Quick charge 3.0 in-box charger does a pretty good job.\n7. UFC 2.1 (fast storage, helps in speed optimization)\n8. 4G+ network really boost up the speed. (supports Dual 4G too)\n9. 3.5 mm jack :p\n\n\nCons-\n1. Buying experience from Flipkart.\n2. Armoured edition is a myth (looks good but don't pay additional charges for it)\n3. Build doesn't feel premium\n4. Display (it still uses gorlilla glass 3) Although I don't have any problem as such but Amoled display would have made this a whole package. So, most of the best features showcased for MiUI11 won't be available for this phone.\n5. Bulky Notch\n6. Slo-mo mode in stock camera app is useless. (use GCam) overall stock camera app is not the best.\n\nOverall it's a good phone but now that I have used it extensively, I wouldn't recommend to buy it in 2019.\nGo for Redmi Note 8 pro, if you are MiUI fan or Mi A3 for stock android feel, if you're looking to buy a Xiaomi phone in year 2019.",

I'm a heavy smart phone user and this phone handles it all without getting hot. But I don't play games so I can't talk about gaming and all. But my friend uses one and in his phone PUBG runs well. I do a lot of video streaming on Netflix and Prime Video, I check and compose mail, play music online, watch YouTube & check my social media. I'm a college student so I need to be online at all times and the batter is very good too, charges very fast. Just lock your phone and let it charge for an hour, it will charge up to 80-90%.

            "Really happy with this phone and as I opted for the 8gigs/256 GB variant it honestly doesn't get any better than that.... And still with all that hype around for the redmi note 7pro I sincerely doubt whether it can compete against the SD 845 soc. If you're are a game enthusiast and like play high graphic intense games then this phone is top notch and the liquid cooling system is like a icing on top of the cake",
            "Phone is extremely good in performance. Camera performance is good. Battery is draining fast like fast charging. No heating problem. The price of Armoured Edison of 8GB RAM and 258 storage is little bit higher side. Suggest to go for 6gb RAM and 64 GB which is value for money.",

            "Very happy with my purchase. The phone is snappy and have not experienced any lag. There are some bugs but not major ones which are assured to be fixed by Xiaomi. Camera is outstanding, low light performance blew my mind. Anyone who like to do more than just phone stuff should buy this phone (emulators work without any lag or frame drops which is the best test for performance). Lastly no overheating even after an hour of PUBG in ultra settings.",
            "One of the best phones in the market. I'm a heavy pubg gamer. Battery lasts almost half a day. Decent graphics. 845 really does the job. Would definitely recommend to all my fellow gamers....",
            "POCO F1 is the \"Master of Speed\" in every true sense. I got this mobile only recently since i was really not sure if i wanted an Xiaomi Branded product. So let's get down to the nitty gritty of the usage. I am sure most people here must have read all reviews and seen videos on YouTube on this. But i want you to go through my review just in case you are thinking of buying it. It's short and concise.\n\nPros:\n1. Snapdragon 845 + 8GB RAM at 25K is more than you can ask for. On top of it 256GB storage. Full points to Xiaomi on this.\n2. It's super fast. I opened 37 apps simultaneously and it still works without breaking a sweat. Benchmarks scores are justified.\n3. Games run on full HD without any frame drops whatsoever.\n4. Stereo speakers dude !!! The sound is good for a phone at this price.\n5. Face unlock is not a gimmick. It works great on this phone even in darkness.\n6. Camera is good, but the dynamic range feels off. Editing on snapseed gave me the best results.\n7. Battery is a monster and charging speed is good. More work and less charging.\n\nCons:\n1. After using Honor it feels just heavy. The 4000mah battery has made its contribution here.\n2. Heats up if you are using a case; charging it and playing games continously.\n3. Screen could have been better. Just saying; and the large notch is a bother.\n4. MI needs to step up it's UI Game.\n\nIf you are thinking between this and One plus 6T (Because that's the competition), then go for this. Period.",
            "the phone has good performance during multi tasking. has good speed during gameplay. has good ai enabled camera. the front camera is great for selfie. no hanging or display issue. automatic brightness seems to be an issue. it has semi premium look. the front camera takes a lot of space which could have been better designed. battery is good for two days with average use. the fast charging is good. an hour gets is ready for a day.\noverall nice phone but seems a bit costly for my purchase of 29000. seems I could have settled for one plus.",
            "i am putting this review after using this for a month now. i must say, Wow.... Wow.... Wow.... i got this in 21899 by exchanging my old redmi note 4. awesome piece. awesome speed. camera is fabulous, battery is extremely good. fast charging. speaker sound is v good.",
            "worth for money .. if you want to buy a phone in small budget , you can go for it... it is too good and performance is above the level.. one issue of the phone is notch , since the notch is of large size , there is no way for displaying the notification.. if that's not an issue, you can buy this best one without any second thought..",

No screen bleeding at all\nface unlock & fingerprint - no other phone can match this\n\nSo suggested to definitely do the math as well as accounts before buying any other brand",

Good value for money\n\nCons:\n1. Power cable is not good enough. seems a faulty cable. Please check every accessories. Don't trust blindly like me :)\n2. Software is not good enough. I am developer and it does not store developer preference. ( developer option goes away after some time, have to tap 5 times again on version)\n3. Need to fix Camera stabilization issue\n\nOverall, worth to buy it.",

The second space is really awesome feature, in case u want to run both 4g sim and two simultaneous accounts like for whatsapp.\n\n4.Fingerprint sensor is extremely fast compared to the one plus 3 i had.\n\n5. One drawback, i am not sure maybe thr is an option to do it, but should come as default, for notifications i have to pull down the screen everytime, it doesnt show on top.\n\n6.

            "A well rounded compact powerhouse with excellent battery.\nPros\n* Great Battery life\n* Performance is excellent\n* Sufficient RAM 6/8gb. RAM management is not bad\n* Internal storage is apt along with Micro SD expansion\n* Dual 4G and VoLTE - both SIMs run in 4G and both SIMs support VoLTE\n* Phone is neatly made.\n\nCons\n* Camera is a disappointment. A minor Software enhancement can go a long way in making the quality better. GCam proves that the camera hardware is good enough, Stable GCam mod only available on root.\n* MIUI - although better among other custom UI's, a stock android would be better off, in terms of timely updates as well as usability. Pie came to the device only a few weeks ago so pretty slow updates\n* The notch was not needed. The screen has a thick bezel on all sides. The screen quality is sub par - one of the areas cost cutting was done. Its LCD and not AMOLED\n\nOverall a pretty complete package. Great performance in real world scenarios.",

            "For years I had wanted a flagship level phone but was unwilling to spend too much. When OnePlus came, I thought that this was it. But due to budgetary constraint was not able to go for it. A few years later came the Poco F1. I waited for my phone budget to improve. Initially I thought of going for the 6 GB/64 GB one, but I thought that the best hardware offering by Poco would be more suitable, as I had no plans to change my phone for at least a couple more years. So I went for the 8 GB/256 GB Armored Edition. That was the only one that I thought looked like a proper flagship phone.\n\nNow, after using it for a few weeks, I have no regrets about my choice. The phone is a beast with an enormous 4000 mAH battery which gives amazing talk and standby times. I got Antutu score of more 2,65,000. Keeping that aside, in day-to-day tasks it is comparable to my iPad in smoothness (that says everything).\n\nThis is one phone that no one would regret buying.",

            "I have been using this device now more than 3 weeks, performance is smooth thanks to 8 gb ram, and camera is also very good despite the same as redmi note 5 Snapdragon 845 makes a huge difference in image quality. battery life is just wow ( 2 days easliy with moderate use) on this device. i was using oneplus 3T so battery is significant improvement over that.",
            "Looks great as for now. Good value for money. Even though much can be improved on the screen, can't expect more in this price.",
            "Awesome mobile but build quality is not good. I have shifted from one plus to poco and enjoying its feature. side plastic like material quality should be improve in poco f2. If the side panel was aluminium then it will be best mobile. Notch is little big.",
            "About the phone there is no issues. It's awesome as the adv clip. Good to buy at this price. But my issue is with the Flipkart. Ordered in No Cost EMI thru SBI Card. Now they are saying to pay in Interest. Ultimate thing is they are claiming tht I paid thru HDFC card which I don't even have. I gt 2800 cashback thru SBI Card and opted 3 months no cost EMI. Customer Care is not responding and keeping me in Hold and disconnecting after 15 mins.",
            "What an amazing phone. Simply loved it. This must be one of the best phone in this price. Go for it.",
            "Great phone ever. Superb camera. Battery last long. Excellent battery backup. No heating. Good display. Over all excellent mobile. Great deal by flipkart.",

            "This is an awesome device. Really happy purchasing this phone. Flipkart delivery is super quick. camera and display is awesome. sound from speakers is great. Phone is super snappy. Ekart delivery is super quick. Screen is awesome. No screen bleeding issue found. Back is made up of real kevlar. Awesome to feel. Thanks flipkart and ekart for this great product.",
            "This is the 3rd time I purchased mobile from Flipkart. Excellent Service. Got it under 2 days, fresh & undamaged product. But I'll suggest it's better to ship these kinda stuffs in hard box instead of plastic bag for better protection. Talking about the phone - yup, definitely it's best in this price range. Redmi never disappoints. But camera quality can be better. Low light pictures lacks details. Rest, everything is fine.",
            "compared in detail with apple X and one plus 6 before buying. can afford all yet chose POCO because of amazing Xiaomi battery capacity, super fast processor and smooth UI. Nd of course, it's the best bang for your buck. I recommend buying the Kevlar variety- feels very premium",
            "i am a gamer and play games on long stretch.\nas a normal user i found the display and the response as good, but on prolonged use i found the system hanging after 3 hours of continuous play and once was forced to reboot.\nWith respect to camera performance its good, clean crystal clear snaps.\nResponse to touch and opening of apps is instantaneous.\nLittle heavy because of kevlar back.\nloud Speaker sound is good but not loud enough compared to other mid level android phones.",
            "The best phone you can get at this price tag. Beast of a phone with respect to performance and more than average camera. Battery is also pretty decent and lasts for close to 15 hrs after every day use.. Best but I have ever done..",
            "best in price n speed is awesome n best is it's liquid cool",
            "Speed is very good. Look and feel is excellent spl. for Armoured Edition.Face unlock works awesome in dark also.Battery is very good in heavy uses works for one and half day, 50% charged in 30 mnts.Good phone value for money.I have Samsung Note 9 also, same battery in Note 9, works just less then single day.",
            "Its an awesome and a classic one. The way expected it to be. Even better. Last phone I had was Samsung Note 4.\nScreen 10/10\nVolume 10/10\nSound - Loud and great but Don't expect to be soothing and low like iphone\nCamera Rear and Front... Both superb\nSolid make\nI Loved it.",

            "I have been using it for quiet a while. camera quality is good. Performance wise it is the best phone I have ever used. No hanging issues no heating issues and battery life is more than a day around 36 hours you can use it.The best part is snapdragon 845. All the high segment mobile phone features are present in this mobile phone. Just Go For It",
            "Amazing phone Awesome Specs brilliant camera Powerful performance and an Amazing Battery",
            "terrific performance with unmatched durability, camera is nice specially the front one offering portrait mode too, poco ui is fresh and easy to use, face detection is super fast and even work in dark thanks to ir technology you get 238 GB of space and can be expanded to 256 GB of memory card, this phone is total worth of every penny.",
            "personally if you are planning to buy this for pubg then i would not recommend you to buy this . it is far more better to buy any recent phones like realme 5 pro , redmi note 8 , etc . The problem with this is the ghost touch due to which some unknown touch would be noted . i bought it 2 months backs and i am fed up of using it for pubg , it gives 50-60 fps but the sensitivity even in medium is wasted . But this happens not only in pubg but also in youtube sometimes you would not be able to scroll down in youtube due to this issue . i was using realme 5 pro before this and i can assure you that it ran pubg better than poco f1 even in ultra graphics .",

If you are a relatively fast Tyler, the touch responsiveness will disappoint you. It's impossible to type fast unless you turn off haptic feedback on the keyboard.\n2. You will miss a lot of your notifications on MiUI and due to the notch you won't be able to see them in your status bar either. Even if you hide the notch the issue still persists.\n3. Since the camera has no OIS the night time shots are rather shaky even with Gcam's Night Sight.\n4. The display is good except the light bleeding in the bottom.\n\nIf those issues don't bother you, or if you are willing to flash custom ROMs then I highly recommend this phone.",

Bought the phone for 18k from Flipkart nearly a year back, can't complain anything about the price and completely satisfied from a vfm point of view. The SD845 is a beast and could it with 8GB ram you have a monster performer in hand. Although the display is LCD it's quite good and won't disappoint anyone. The only con I can think of is the huge notch which eats into display but this vanishes when you see how quickly the incorporated IR camera helps you perform face unlock even in pitch darkness.. great phone overall and people who don't buy this thinking that you won't get an update beyond Android 10 / MIUI 12, there are so many custom ROMs available out there for you to try and has already been proven to run Android 11 beta as seen from YouTube videos... So go for this if you don't care about the looks but value performance and solid build quality.. overall one of the best phones ever made, coming from a galaxy note 8 user..",

Some people may have reported issues with display and all, honestly, mine is just fine. If you have to spend more than 3-4 seconds to spot screen bleeding, your unit is fine. It isn't screen bleeding if you see it on particular colours or angles. I saw people on YouTube expanding their videos and then complaining that the right side of the screen is too rounded. Those are worthless reviews. The default aspect ratio is just fine. Some reported issues with screen touch latency. I did not encounter such a problem. I've typed this on my Poco and it's just fine without any problems. Also, one should not whine if the Porche that they bought for a price of BMW, has some minor issues that is acceptable and/or fixable/serviceable. I also think that there are paid reviews on YouTube and it's just not very reliable unless you extensively watch multiple videos and then take a decision to purchase. I'm also a keen smartphone user and this phone has aptX which is amazing. The Face Unlock is simply THE BEST I've seen.
