            "Camera is good in day light but in low light it is not what I expected it to be. Also pictures taken by its primary senser is bit warmer and skin colours are also saturated by it.And it feels bit heavy. U can't use it with one hand because of its width.And also lots of bloatware are pre installed on it and clean master is also there which takes all d permission and after that you can't deny it. Even calculator app wants numbers of permission. And one more Dangerous app is its default ME Browser App",

Also pictures taken by its primary senser is bit warmer and skin colours are also saturated by it.And it feels bit heavy. U can't use it with one hand because of its width.And also lots of bloatware are pre installed on it and clean master is also there which takes all d permission and after that you can't deny it. Even calculator app wants numbers of permission. And one more Dangerous app is its default ME Browser App",

            "Overview: Great product with probably best specs at this price point. Decent camera, great looks, great battery and charging.\n\nDesign:Looks great and classy due to gorilla glass at back. camera bump is slightly bigger but this issue can fixed by using cover. Phone is slightly bigger.\n\nDisplay:It has 6.67inch ips lcs display. Viewing angles are good has Decent brightness. There is screen bleeding around camera cutout and edges of display but not a big deal every lcd djisplay has screen bleeding and can be solved by using dark mode.\n\nCamera:Forget about megapixels it has Decent camera. back camera is good video quality is also good u can record video in 4k. macro camera is great.\nBut front camera is not that great I don't know why it makes faces yellowish. hope it will be resolved in future updates.\n\nBattery and charging: Best in this price segment can be used for 2 days in normal usage. It takes 1:20-25 min to full charge,above 58%in 30 min,85%in 1 hour. For me it's battery and charger was deal breaker.\n\nPerformance:it has Snapdragon's 720g. Great performance. But I saw some lags in the UI which can be solved in future updates. I didn't played pubg but I played some games no heating issue at all.\n\nSpeaker: nice speaker. Vocals are clear and has Decent loudness\n\nFinal verdict: I think it's best phone in this price point. U can opt this over realme 6 only realme 6's camera is better than this.\n\nDeducted one star due to its privacy issues. Clean master is still there.\n\nHope it is helpfull. Press like button if it is.\n\nAdding some pics for better insight.",

            "Display: im the one who used Samsung s7 sAmoled 551ppi QHD+ display for 3 yrs. So this kinda a let down for me. Contrast level is good & colors are well calibrated but still u can feel a downgrade if u have used a AMOLED panel before. & 90hz would have been greatest. I think faster refresh rate boomed amoled growth in India, every phone around 15k-20k was coming with amoled & then high refresh rate arrived with oneplus & all company started giving lcd with 90/120hz I will still prefer sAmoled over 90hz/120hz icd\nCamara: use Gcam.. Default camara is very feature proof. I'm used to pro mode for even video & that's a reason why I peaked this phone over realme 6i. & I'm into filmmaking so hopefully I will try provideo 4k 30 log quite often. But I would loved to see EIS in 4k & 1080p 60fps to add slowmo & still doesn't have to worry about my non-log & Log footage not looking similar in post production in log format bcoz as u choose log it automatically switches to 4k 30.\nWhat I want in update is 2x portrait option in portrait mode like xiaomi did with redmi note 5 pro. & 24fps in video bcoz why not iPhone is doing that for years so it's time to give it in default app.\nPerformance: great but I want smooth + extrme in 4gb ram version though I haven't noticed any lag in smooth+ultra\nBattery: killer battery life easily 1 day phone. Well optimized\nSoftware: I want miui 12 in future update(upcoming weeks) & with that miui 12 I want I single bloatware removed.\nOn hand feel: bulky & too tall. I think 6.2 should be the largest any phone can go. 5.8 in pixel & iPhone is perfect size\nSo great phone for the price",

You Get a Great Battery Which Longs For More Than 2 Days Of Normal Use. Camera Is Awesome. But Night Mode Is Not Too Much Satisfactory, And 10x Zoom Quality Is Also Not Clear. But Except This Everything Is Great In Camera, The HDR, Macro Camera, Main Camera 48mp Are Just Awesome And Also 4k Video Recording Is Also Great!\nTalking about performance the Snapdragon 720g is fully worth it and please buy 6gb ram varient for best performance results. I Don't Experience Any Lag Or Heating Problems In This Phone. The Phone Temperature Maximum Goes 39\u00b0C While Extreme Gaming. About Charging: This Phone Charge In 1:40 Hours Approximately You Will Feel 38\u00b0C Temperature Of Phone When It's Charging Between 20 - 70% Because Of Turbo Speed Charging Between These Levels. And After 70% It Goes Cooler And Phone Charges A Bit Slowly This Because Of Good Battery Life In Future. Talking about UI: Even it has MIUI 11 This phone doesn't contains any ads in it. It has poco own launcher. You must see some banned applications from China but you can uninstall them. Privacy problem has also fixed but not fully. But don't worry In future Mi Will give a software update to fix those apps and much secure privacy.\n\nAt last I will tell you please buy this phone this Will really very much value for money and you will enjoy it definitely in fact this is great package than Redmi note 9 pro.

Processor is good so one won't face any problem in day to day life usage... There is also no heating issue during charging....I don't do heavy gaming so I have no idea about gaming on this device.... but according to it's price range it is best value for money for regular usage... Also initially all banned Chinese apps are present but an ota update has given by poco to fix it....During this 3 days usage i haven't find a single add which is really impressive... Sound quality also good and audio output through Bluetooth device or ear phones is good.... Weight distribution is nice and it's not heavy although it has a big massive battery... So finally in this price range it's a value for money device .",
            "Yeah, I definately liked the phone...\n1. BATTERY :- It's has got amazing battery which easily gives me more than 8 hours of SOT on moderate usage. It may drop it around 6 hours on heavy usage.\n2. CHARGING:- But disappointed with the charging speed. It is very unpredictable. Sometimes it charges like zap and sometimes it's takes more than usual. And please don't use phone while charging it. It's charging speed drops significantly. It feels like you are charging it with 10w of power.\n3. CAMERAS:- And talking about cameras... They are great... Definately one of the best in the segment and I loved the macro camera. But the burst mode don't work though there is a feature. That's disappointing.\n4. SOFTWARE EXPERIENCE:- I regret to say this but it's the worst smartphone experience with MIUI. It's barely optimised. The dark mode don't work properly... even on some system applications. Sometimes framework stops working which is very frustrating. The alignment of some icons on the status bar in landscape mode also is off. And I shifted from a vivo device and I feel like Funtouch OS was way better.\n5. PERFORMANCE:- I never had any issues while playing heavy games @60 fps also. But sometimes some apps crashes which may be due to software, like whatsapp hangs sometimes. No complaints from performance though.\n6. DISPLAY:- No complaints but it would have been better if the brightest was more. But still enjoys the multimedia on the big 6.67 inchs screen and nice and loud speakers.\nCONCLUSION:-\nApart from software I don't have any major problems from this device and I think software will improve with time with the coming of MIUI 12 (Atleast I hope so\ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb)\nSo you should definitely consider this device.\nI AM A GENUINE BUYER AND JUST TELLING YOU THE TRUTH WHICH I FACED.\nPLEASE CONSIDER THE ABOVE POINTS WHILE PURCHASE.",

            "Purchased this phone during the Diwali sale for 11k and I must say, at that price this phones a killer. Will divide the review between pros & cons\n\nPros :\n\n1. Gorilla glass at front & back give it a super premium look & feel. Frame is plastic and the phone feels really good to hold.\n\n2. Charging speed & battery life r outstanding. The SD 720G is a super Power efficient processor. The 5000 mah battery can easily last for 1.5 to 2 days and the 33 watt charger is splendid. Can charge the phone from 0 to 100% in 70 mins.\n\n3. Performance is good. The SD 720G is a capable processor and gets daily job done with ease. I haven't faced any heating issues either.\n\n4. Camera is very good during the day. Pics come out with good detail. However the pics r a bit saturated which however look good to the eyes.\n\n5. Display is an IPS panel with Full HD resolution. The display quality is really good for an IPS panel.\n\n6. Has an IR Blaster which can be used as a remote control.\n\nCons:\n\n1. The MIUI is not stable and is not makin good use of the very capable SD 720G processor. MIUI needs a lot of improvement and stability.\n\n2. Camera is bad under artificial lighting conditions and when it's dark. Download gcam for better results.\n\n3. This one's not really a con but it would have been awesome if the display was amoled.\n\nOverall a very good buy at 11k. One of the best phones at that price.",

            "After using poco m2 pro for a month I found this smartphone to be a nice one , it's display is pretty large and it feels bigger in hands . The battery backup is good and the 33W fast charger is one of the best feature that I like in this smartphone . The performance is also nice it is fast and smooth but some times just because of the miui 12 I feel that it needs to be optimised . Camera is also decent specially I like the night mode.\nSo in terms of performance and looks It is an awesome smartphone .",

            "Very good phone I am writing this review after 1 week to using this phone.. This phone charger is very good we have 33 watt fast charger with this phone.. It takes near about 1 hour to full charge.. and battery backup is very good you can use one and half day after full charge. The performance of this phone is very good we get SD 720G chipset in this phone this processor is very good for PUBG and any other havy gaming. Overall this phone is very good on this price.. and value for money...",
            "All good. There's bunch of comments about not so good camera performance, but personally I can't expect more at this range. Also, there's lot of negative feedback on YT about it's heavy weight, I didn't feel that, it's designed acc. to it. Battery performance is the best, it was charging from 20 to 100% in an hour and 15 mins and also lasting 2.5 days on a single charge. So yeah, a great product. There's just one thing that it won't be receiving the latest MIUI 12 update in the first batch, even though it being the latest launched device from MI; but it does have a bunch of those features from MIUI 12 already preinstalled.\n\nI don't think there's any need to purchase an additional back cover, because the one in the box is better than what it used to be.",
            "Bought this smartphone for 10.5K in the big billion sale. I'm loving it. The camera is awesome, very well optimised by MI. Performance is also great, there are no lags or whatsoever. The only thing i didn't like about it is the ads and bloatware from MIUI. You can opt out of most of the ads in the initial set up though.\nAlso, the phone is running on android 10, i don't know when the company provides android 11 updates, as i got it quite quick on my Realme narzo 20A. Overall, this is a very good package. Thank you flipkart!! The delivery guy was polite and oh it took just 2 days to get my phone. \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude04",

            "Cameras so good \" best mobile good price good performance \" but kindly one request \" don't give any update camera bugs less quality \" because am using poco f1 miui 12 totally damm camera quality",
            "Camera is good with lots of pro features and also front camera gives too sharp photos as a 16mp shooter but feels much higher and yes in indoors the front camera over saturates the colors rest is fine in camera performance.\n\nPerformance is perfect for playing pubg believe me guys it can play pubg mobile at 50-60 fps on HDR plus extreme using gfx tool I had tested and day to day performance is also good,\n\nTalking about the display it gives nice colour contrast and is a huge one 6.67\" And is decent bright in outdoors and yes it supports HDR content on YouTube\n\nBattery is good enough to make your day complete even if you are a heavy user and it charges from 0-100 in about 1 hour 25 minutes hence pretty good considering a 5000 miliamp hour battery\n\nSpeakers are decent loud but comes with great bass effect believe me you can hear all the drums in a song\n\nOver all if you are planning to buy realme 6i then unless you Aren't a fan of 90hz panel please don't purchase it as it's display quality is very disappointing and camera and video quality is very poor I had personally used it for about 10 days\n\nAnd talking about the mediatek g90t vs Snapdragon 720g\nBoth perform very similar yes G90t which is present in realme 6i scores about 10,000 more on antutu but 720g is much more efficient as it is based on 8nm rather than 12nm on g90t and yes 720g is exactly the Snapdragon 730g with navic support and better AI capabilities so don't go to numbers.\n\nSo if you can spend thousand more than poco is definitely a better choice over realme 6i",
            "I like the design of the phone at the price it comes. second thing value for money sd 720G at 12000 awsome. its camera is also a tough competitor. best thing is battery,display,charging. I don't have enough words to describe. but somewhere miui and selfie camera needs little improvement",

The 33W charger bundled with the product charges it really fast (charges in 1 hour).\n3. Loved the display as well. (Full hd+ display rocks) btw should have given amoled disp :)\n4. 48 mp camera is also good.\n5. The processor performance of Snapdragon 720G is really impressive (Really fast). And also an advantage of the UFS2.1 storage ( Read and write speed is gr8).\n6. Love with Design of the phone square camera module(is really attractive)\n7. Side mounted Fingerprint is very fast as well(Unlocks in milliseconds).",

You can play heavy games and daily task easily\nYour budget is 12k then you can go for it..\n\ud83d\udc9b",
            "One of the highest spec phones currently in the under 15000 budget (for the 4 GB RAM variant). The 4GB RAM is enough for heavy games but more importantly the processor + GPU is able to keep up and deliver quality graphics even for heavy games. I didn't face any abnormal hearing issues either.\n\nThe camera is decent. I know there may be better cameras out there but it's already very good for the price range. The display only has the normal 60 Hz refresh rate but viewing angles are good. The max brightness is quite high so the screen is visible even under direct sunlight. The low brightness is low enough to comfortably see in the dark.\n\nThe back is glass so you'll always want to use the case with it. The case provided in the box is okay and the phone is comfortable to hold even with the case on. However if you often drop your phone then get one with a plastic back.\n\nMIUI is loved by some and hated by others. Get the phone if you are okay with MIUI or are ready with the tools and knowledge to replace it.",

            "It's been 6 Months using this POCO M2 Pro.\nLet's start this review\n1. Powerful Processor : POCO M2 Pro has Qualcomm 720G Processor in it with Qualcomm Adreno 618 GPU which is great combination and the price of this phone makes it extraordinary.\n2. Strong Battery : It has 5000mah battery, battery backup it good as well. The special thing is it has 33W charging support which you can see it takes approximately an hour to full charge which is great in this price range and this is more than expectation.\n3. Normal Camera : I'm not the one who loves to take pictures and i think i can't provide review about it because i don't actually pay attention to it besides clicking photos of documents. but overall it is capable of fulfilling basic needs related to camera.\n4. Mind-blowing Display : POCO M2 Pro comes with 6.67inch FHD+ display which is kind of great having mobile with big screen. and yes the best part is it comes with covering of Gorila Glass 5 which is latest in market and there were many times my phone was dropped by mistake and that doesn't made any difference it was same as before.\n\nI think this is enough to convince you to purchase this awesome product, personally I've been using this phone from 6 months and it was great experience using it. I'm a happy customer of POCO.",
            "Overall in terms of specs provided, it's simply a brilliant phone, but specs don't tell the entire story.\n\nPros:\n-Really good camera for the price no complaints there. Camera: (4.5/5)\n-The processor is best in segment, so u can expected great performance but...(see rest in cons)\nPerformance: 4.25/5\n-Charging speed is pretty good with 33W charger, but certainly realme chargers are faster.\n-Display (4/5): not an amoled but a pretty good IPS display no complaints, but certainly u can get way better display on a realme 8/ redmi note 10 with amoled displays.\n-Build quality and design(4.5/5): is pretty good as it is the only phone in it's price to come with a glass back. However don't know about its durability as certain videos have shown it can easily break!!\n\nCons:\n-Software experience is a major con which certainly detoriates day to day performance. While the UI looks good with lots of animations, but it makes it slightly slower as well. However, the main problem is the occasional hangs and stutters which makes u feel u r using a cheaper/older phone, and completely makes u forget it has a SD720G!\n-The software also has quite a few bugs which once again heavily affects your day to day usage.\n-Battery life could have been better as it has detoriated after a recent software update.",

            "My Worst decision ever \ud83e\udd72\n\nList of Bugs and Issues:\n\nAnimation bugs:\n1. No closing animation in Poco launcher since the beginning.\n2. App Opening animation and other few swiping animations in the home screen are laggy in Poco launcher compare to the smooth miui system launcher.\n3. No unlocking and locking animation like miui system launcher. Instead while unlocking it's suddenly going to the home screen and while locking it suddenly goes black with no animation and smoothness there.\n\nFull-screen navigation bugs:\n4. In the recent menu, a Whiteline (in light mode) or Blackline (in dark mode) appears in each application bottom while using the navigation pill or navigation button.\n5. Navigation pill isn't properly adopting colour, sometimes navigation pill background colour becomes white or black instead of being transparent in home screen ( Poco launcher ).\n6. Navigation pill isn't properly optimized for switching between apps. Sometimes swiping left or right instead of switching between apps, it got stuck and then simply goes to the home screen ( Poco launcher ).\n7. Full-screen navigation gestures don't support other third-party launchers.\n\nWidgets Issues:\n6. Poco launcher aren't properly optimized for widgets, Some third-party widgets just got crop from sides like new Spotify and Mi notes widgets.\n\nMissing features from MIUI system laucher:\n1. Global icon animations are missing.\n2. Arrange items in the recent menu option is missing.\n3. Doesn't have float window gesture and float window option in the recent menu.\n4. There is no option to remove the app drawer.\n\nSome other issues:\n7. Frame drop issues in Poco launcher while scrolling in the app drawer, swiping in home screen, opening notification center, and also in switching between apps through navigation pills.\n8. Poco devices can't install far better and improved miui system launcher because of Poco launcher but mi & other brands also can install Poco launcher too. Isn't it unfair to Poco users?\n9. Poco users also can't install third-party launchers because full-screen navigation gestures don't support by Poco launcher or miui 12/12.5.\n10. App Suggestions are useless, not accurate like miui system launcher and other brands.\n11. Floating window doesn't properly work in Poco launcher. It creates many issues sometimes.\n12. Poor updates and improvements, Poco launcher rarely gets any new update. Even whenever it get any new updates. Its changelog always mentions \"1. We fixed some bugs in this version, 2. Optimize performance and improve the fluency\". But we can't see or feel any improvements or bugs fixes. New features forget about it.",

On the whole if you want a phone for day to day usage of surfing, playing ocassional games and expect a decent performance go for it, if you need great performance with great camera I would better suggest to increase your budget",

            "I've been using dis phone about two weeks and here's my review-\n\nFirst of all,\n\n(Camera 2/5-) honestly, camera doesn't matter for me coz I don't take picture a lot but for d viewers I will write some..for me photo should be sharp n clear even when we zoom in.. But dis phone give u over saturated photo n over filtered image.. Bdw girls might impress with it but for me it's not d best one.\n\n(Battery 4/5) - some says it's massive battery phone but I say it's not that, I might say it's average backup coz my last phone's battery backup was 4000mah n I didn't found much difference..\n\n( Processor 4/5 ) - people might say it's a beast gaming phone as it has 720g processor, I tried different game..in game like Mobile Legends, Coc, n God of olympus it perform well but when it come to pubg I would say it's bad coz I don't feel that smoothness on game, for pubg player it's not d device for you n if u really wanna feel excitement of pubg u should go for more dan 855 sd processor n atleast 6gb rom phones.. For pug b I wouldn't recommend dis device\n\nSome advantages-\n\nFingerprint sensor work really good even when ur finger is little bit sweat , touches work good n floating are smooth, battery last long in normal use when it charged at 100% ( but u have to charge 4 or 5 five minutes extra even it's 100% ) n for d pubg player it could last 4 to 5 hours, n yeah 33w fast charger charge more dan u expected\n\nN some disadvantages-\n\nWhen u play heavy games like pubg it heated up a little bit n at last it became laggy n affecting ur game, it heated up even when u download big files n when ur internet connection unstable, camera is not good as expected as it's take over saturated photos n low sharpness image, n atleast poco should provide screen protector with box..\n\nSo , My overall rating would be 3.5 out of 5 as it is average phone some says it's a beast phone but blve me guys it's not it's just average\n\nAnd lastly, to flipkart - always late delivery , deducting half star for poor delivery service from ur courier partner.\n\nHope my review help you all, thank you",
            "If you get it at 11999 or even better at 10999 it is the best deal best phone for gaming under 15000 budget just need some optimisation........ 1 day battery garenteed 2 days if you just use it for calling whatsappp ...... PUBG by default you get smooth+ ultra(40fps) but if you use GFX you can get 60 fps constant (56 fps) with your phone heating a bit open fan its okay......even in hot drop you get decent fram rates.....camera needs some optimisation it is a samsung camera its pretty decent but sony camera aaare next level you get 33waat charger in box chaging speeds are insane",
            "Great Phone, Charges faster than my Oneplus 8, Camera Quality is also decent for the price. The display is amazing despite being LCD. Bought it for my mother and overall it's great.\nJUST one Con - It's very heavy and bulky \ud83e\udd7a",
            "I think at 11999 flipkart big bonanza sale has brought a great value for money product the poco m2 pro, with its large 5000mah battery coupled with the 33w charger included in the box it can blow your minds up. The poco m2 pro does not stop there it has a best quad camera setup in a budget which I don't think anyone can compete in the competition. When comes to its performance it is blazingly fast and one can hardly notice any lag or jitter thanks to the new 8nm based Qualcomm Snapdragon 720g processor by the way made for gamers cannot disappoint you at all after all it can play any game you throw at it.\nBut one minor con is that the display is not super Amoled and is locked at 60hz refresh rate.\nFINAL VERDICT: It is a go to smartphone for anyone who wants gaming on a budget of 11999.\nShout out to flipkart for delivering the product within 2 days.\nWarm Regards to Poco family and Poco fans.",

Display quality is average.\n6. Glass back and front.\n7. Sound is louder.\n\nCons :-\n\n1. Loudness doesn't certainly means good. The speaker lacks quality and has less crispier sound. If you are true music lover then this phone is not ideal for listening music on phone's speaker. It's just for ringtones.\n\n2. Display should have at least 90hz refresh rate but sadly what we get is 60hz (\ud83d\ude43 price \ud83d\ude43)",

And display also.\n..I completely disappointed with battery life and performance\nIt's saying 5000 mah battery but it is only like 3500mah.\nI'm a moderate user but it will last by using one day from 6am-9pm .\nProcessor is very weak, Qualcomm Snapdragon 720g is most powerful but in this product it is not well. Becoming hang between use. Massages of not responding is coming.it is like 2GB ram in performance.but actually 4GB.\n\n..Very big problem is slot for earphone is complaint some times and not able to hear with ordinary speaker , only with loud speaker. but after some plug in and out process it'll become normal. It made above 10 times between the use of 5 months. I completely disappointed in this product of 4gb ram. It's only in my gadget my friend also bought this product he has no problem like this..\n\nI suggest you all to buy gadgets in premium quality from 1plus, oppo,huawei and Samsung.

            "I bought it in Jan 2021 and writing review after around 4 months of usage. This is a very genuine review as I really felt like people should be informed correctly about the phone rather than they going into frenzy by Youtubers. Below are issues that I have already seen in this phone:\n1. The charger keeps connecting-disconnecting when put to charge. The frequency of on-off can vary on percentage of battery charged and sometimes just without any logic. But this is very irritating if you are using the phone while charging. I couldn't yet find reasons behind this fault.\n2. The display is bad as compared to even Xiomi/Redmi's other phone standards. I have used Redmi Note 3, 4 and 5 A so I can say Poco M2 Pro has got worst display. You can see previously used applications fade print in background even if you are using some other app. This is not very pronounced but in dark content videos its easily visible. This is a very big let down and gives feeling of really bad quality display.\n3. The headphone socket has eventually shown issues 4-5 times as in sometimes when you insert the jack, the phone will remain in earpiece mode and when you will take the jack out, it will go into headphone mode. This is really really pathetic. The workaround is to restart the phone.\n4. Camera is lower than average, it struggles to focus on desired objects specially in bright sunlight. It will focus on farther objects well when you are actually clicking pic of something very close.\n5. Built is good and is strong even when backside is of glass (though I have kept cover). However the weight of phone is really too high. It will pain your hands for sure.\n6. The placement of headphone jack is really mindless. Its in lower left part of phone which causes hindrance to put the phone and do video calls or simply watch something while headphones on.\n\nOverall: I bought this phone in Rs. 10999 during offer and was actually ready to accept a few defects given it is a feature rich phone. However the defects now I see are so many that even 10999 seems higher to me. Poco has degraded the quality by MIUI 12 further. There are bugs, glitches, hanging issues and poor RAM management. I have not hated any of my previous phones as I hate Poco M2 Pro.",

I restarted the phone, recharged it again and again. The problem persisted. For one time I even thought of using the phn while connected to the charger (like a corded phn).. alas.

Charging speed is decent but not fast as realme 30 watt dart charge it will take arround 1.5 hrs to charge the battery completely, battery backup is good but it was degraded by the latest software update.\n4. Screen quality is good as per ips panel.\n5. It supports carrier aggregation so no network issues in this smartphone.\n6. MIUI is the worst UI which i had experienced till now, hardware of this phone is top notch but it had destroyed by the miui. there many bugs in ui which feel while using the phone. many apps crashes and you will notice various lags and jerkiness in ui.\nI WILL RECOMMEND YOU TO GO FOR OTHER BRANDS IN THIS PRICE RANGE, THERE YOU WILL GET BETTER EXPERIENCE THAN THE HARDWARE.",

Battery - 33 w charger charge 5000 mh battery really fast and if you are not gamer then it can be use upto 2 day normal use.\n3.ultra battery saver - good features to run phone for long time if least use of phone .\n4. Camara- good at this price but if you want only camara phone than can see other options of phone in comparison to this may be good at this price.\n\nCons\n1. I saw little lag in UI may in poco launcher or miui 12\nBut that can be fix in further updates.\n2. Phone is little big if less than 6.5 inch then very easy to handle in one hand and easy to use.\n3. Display should be 90 hz\n4.i think no phone company can give you fully secure phone at this price so always except - Google phone , Apple phone . No one can give you Guaranteed secure phone\nSo you have compromise with security at these budget phone.\n\nOverall i will give this phone 4.5/5 rating",

Main and important issue for this phone is when we switch to an app and return to previous app the app will restart and you will lose all the data entered to it. I meant if we have opened a website and have entered some data, if we happened to attend a call in between it and returned to browser it would have reloaded and will display the original website without having the data we entered.

It has no problem. In left side it has a tiny crack, just like a line. But it is mentioned in flipcart that if your old phone have cracks, damaged etc, then flipcart may reduce your exchangeable product value. I told the courier boy many times, showed him the exchangeable product reject/product value reduction conditions which are mentioned in flipcart. But he said that their courier company, Ekart gave him the order not to take any phone if it has any small line like crack! And he finally refused to take my old phone and said many times to cancel my order. Later I have to take my order by providing full price. My experience with flipcart is highly demotivating!",

If you play heavy online games then around 4 hours.\n4. Camera is good if you don't look at number of cameras and its megapixels.\n\nCons:\n1. MIUI is really poor in terms of features, it has many bloatware apps that you cannot uninstall.\n2. Camera, it's 48MP is just for marketing purposes.\n3. If you use earphones the they will have some weird treble and base configuration.\n4. With Vi (Vodafone Idea) SIM the network is really poor. It's good in other phones (tested on Realme).\n\nNote:\nI gave it 5 stars for its price and performance ratio.\nBuy if you don't care about MIUI bugs and camera quality.",

Camera performance is good in better light condition.\n4. Battery backup is awesome. On medium usage like youtube, browsing it lasts for 2 days.\n5. Charging speed is great, takes 1.15 hrs to charge from 0 to 100.\n6. Speaker is loud enough with good quality sound.\n\nCons:\n1. Miui needs improvement, it has lot of bugs.\n2. Camera performance in low light is below average. But using gcam port makes this device awesome for photography.",

It's not a proper UI. Realme UI is much much better than this. Otherwise the camera performance is not that great ( comparing with the same censor in my realme 5 pro). So the software here cannot fully utilise the specs. Otherwise it is a great option if you get it at 12000.

            "It's a great phone. Can buy it.\nEverything is good about this phone.\n\nOne slight thing I didn't like is that when you receive calls the quality of voice you hear is not among the best. It should definitely be much much more better. Hope POCO looks into it and improves it's earphone quality or software so when you receive the call, the quality of voice you hear is crisp, clear, and loud. The voice quality you hear on call is just average. That's my only disappoint with this phone.\n\nThe other person hears it absolutely fine. The ability to catch signal is good.\n\nIf you use Headphones to attend call then the voice is crisp and clear with no issues.\n\nOther then this one issue. The phone is absolutely fantastic.\n\nIf the voice quality in call was great, then I would have said this is the best phone under 20,000 (not just under 15,000).\n\nStill I have given it 5 stars. Because the phone is awesome in every other aspect. And I am hoping POCO would definitely remove this issue by either software/hardware change.",

            "Writing this review after 6 months of usage.\nPerformance is not as good as expected from Snapdragon 720G processor because of very poor optimization from poco company.\nLook of the phone is excellent.\nBattery is superb and will easily last for 1-2 days depending on the usage. If you are light user, it will last for about 3 days sometimes.\nCamera is awesome in this range of phones.\nPoco phones come with miui os which has currently becomes one of the worst because of its slow updates, bugs and lags.\nApp opening animations are also laggy,app crashes many times and there are unusual reboots during calls.\nCamera performance of ok but u get saturated photos, but u can use gcam on this phone without root/unlocking bootloader. Gcam and the inbuilt camera quality are almost same, its just that gcam balances the saturation properly.\nThe phones fingerprint sensor is also not working after 6 months.\nAlso, we can see that poco and mi phones are having large problems with their ota updates these days. Overall I don't recommend this phone for long term usage.\nYou can go for realme 8, which is of the same cost(it has a good software, amoled display and indisplay fingerprint scanner which will last longer)(realme gives slow updates but they are very stable)\nMi (parent campany of poco, poco depends on it for almost everything) has released lots of phones recently and making their os stable in such a situation for all phones will be a big burden for them. So better skip them because software is as important as hardware. Also mi has assured only one major update for poco m2 pro (the phone comes with Android 11)\nIf you want a phone for 4-5 years, better go for oppo phones from 15-20k during the sales. And pls don't misinterpret this.I have said you to buy oppo phones in the range of 15-20k during sales. Buying oppo phones worth lesser than 15k will be your worst experience.\nWhile buying phones pls keep in mind, both hardware and software. If you want software updates for longer time, it's currently being provided my OnePlus and recent Samsung phones only.",

            "I got this mobile in 11000 rupees and i think it's a great deal.\nSo start with the\n\nDesign - i purchased black colour and it's look super classy. But weight of the phone is little bit more as i recently used realme 3 pro which is very lightweight and compact size. You won't use this phone in one hand because it has massive 6.67 inch display. So consider this factor before buying this...\n\nDisplay - it's awesome and the brightness is quite good in sun light. No issue with this excellent quality for this price point. It has only 60 hz refresh rate but i don't feel it's bad thing. It feels smooth you won't believe but when you use this device you will know it.\n\nCamera - it has 48 mp quad camera but poco should have gone with the sony sensor because even note 7 pro has that sensor. But samsung one is also a good sensor and doing pretty well in day light but in night it's average\nAnd front camera is good but it makes skin reddish. I prefer any other brands for selfie over any Xiaomi phone.\n\nPerformance - i personally like Snapdragon processor i recently used realme 3 pro which has 710 and it has 720g. I don't find so much difference. It's a decent processor for day to day use i don't feel any lag till now.\n\nUi - i personally like custom skin because I love customisation. And miui got some great features. And thanks to poco as it has no ads and i don't find any adds till now (using this for 5 days). But ram management is poor. Poco should consider this issue.\n\nHaptic's - OMG i never used keyboard with vibrations on. But since i have started using it with this device i love how haptic's are respond. I heard in youtube review's poco has provided z shock vibrations. And really it's a great vibration motor. Other brands should provide decent vibration motor also.\n\nBattery - in battery department it's a hit and miss till now. I expected better with this but it's good i got 9 hour battery backup in moderate use. So it's not bad. May be miui optimization is not as good as OnePlus or samsung. Poco has provided 33 watt charger in the box and it charges 0 to 50 percent and 0 to 100 percent in 1 hour 10 to 15 minutes. So for me it's a excellent charging speed.\n\nIn short go for it if you are not a camera lover. Specially for selfie lover i suggest realme smartphone. Except camera it's a great device.",
