Nothing special..\n7) if you want YouTube and other features so go with A23 pro. Some spend extra 1600 amount.\n8) conclusion here for 4g lte options calling and hotspot features go can go with this. Yes some time network issue.but that depends your operator. Vodafone having issue but jio works fabulous..\n9) internet speed same like my latest smartphone. Nothing different..\n\nOverall good value for money if you have tight budget. Thanks seller and flipkart...\ud83d\ude0a",
            "I ordered it for my mom and she loved it this phone is really good and the special speaking feature of this phone is raelly great the model and sound quality is little bit low when itvcomes to media player I think but overall its really good just go for it",
            "Writing this review after 18 days of usage\nI wanted to buy a portable 4G hotspot device which supported all sims but none were available in reasonable price .\nSo I brought this phone\nBattery backup on only hotspot mode lasts for 8-10 hours depending on room temperature and signal strength\nHotspot speed is very good\nAnd you can use this device to connect upto 8 device but I have only tried with 4\nI don't recommend it for daily use as a phone\nIt has its utility as a portable hotspot device\n\nTip- Silent mode is available deep in settings\nFrom # button you can only toggle vibration mode\n\nOverall it is a value for money purchase\nIf you want a hotspot device for sharing internet to laptop or PC or tablet then this is what you are looking for since this is not carrier locked like airtel hotspot and jiofi\n\nBattery Backup - 5 star\nHotspot Range - 4 star\nInternet Speed - 5 star\nValue for Money - 5 star\nLooks, Design /Build - 4 star",
            "To the point review....\nCall quality awesome, crystal clear voice with BSNL Mobile 3G network. Did't try 4g volte yet. 3g is enough for me. Looks good. Overall value for money.\nCon as of now is that it takes too much time to fully charge its 1900ah battery. There is a charging problem. Charging from 13% to full takes almost 7.5 hours.",
            "I have given five stars as this phone at this price range is a God send. Great Network Strength, Super Speed Internet. If you want to buy a Data Card/ Dongle with similar battery, it will cost you around the same. So it doesn't make any sense to go for a Dongle when you can buy a freaking phone at the same price. Serves many more functions.\n\nWorks well On Jio 4G\nGreat Build Quality.\nGreat Network Strength.\nSurprisingly good camera at this price.\nExcellent Call Quality - Better than my Nokia 5.1 Plus\nBasic Earphones Included\n\nAt Rs.2499 this is a steal.\n6.5/5",
            "Review after 2 days of usage...\n\n1. Form factor / Looks / Build Quality - Look wise phone is absolutely stunner. Very polished and properly finished product. Colours are glossy. Feels little slippery in hand. But thats OK.\n\n\n2. Usability - performance wise is good.. buttons are little hard. I didn't like keypad very much but its decent and does the job.\n\n3. Screen - cant expect much. But it is well enough in this price range.\n\n4. Features and Performance: Frankly speaking, i bought this phone to avoid the wastage of money in wifi hot spots or any external FTTH connections. This phone is a great deal for those who are looking for a 4g volte phone with hotspot in their budget. I got this in 2199. I did an endurance testing of battery and results were beyond my expectations. Really impressed me a lot in this department.\nIn this test , I used two airtel 4g sims with 32 gb memory card with hotspot and bluetooth headset connected. Started testing in 2.45PM noon and this phone was standing till 11.30pm which is almost 9hrs.. Amazing !!!! I was expecting not more than 4-5 hrs.. But next day , that is today, I started same test again but this time its single data only sim with hotspot only.. I started this in today morning around 9am and its still on and has 47% battery left. Attaching image.\n\n5. Battery - Its almost 1800mah but is good enough for normal stand by.. Even with hotspot or wifi on you can have a day easily.\n\n6. Charging - Bit disappointed in this department. I use Mi 2i powerbank to charge and it takes 4-5 hours to charge fully. I havent tried with any other brand normal charger or fast charger, or even with its own oem charger. I have Oppo 30Watt fast charger with normal 10W chargers along with 5w-18Watt power bank.. i will try with other chargers and let you guys know.\n\n7. Call quality is good enough. Loudspeakers arent much loud but yes they are good. Ringtones too are moderate and pleasant to ears.\n\n8. Connectivity : you have all commonly used connectivity options in this phone.. Dual Volte 4G , Bluetooth, Wifi, and Hotspot. One thing I would like to share and that is, although its bluetooth is v4.2 but its range very nice.. I have Oppo F9 Pro which looses BT after 15 -20 feets but this phone works even beyond 20-25feets.\n\n9. Camera -E cant expect anything..\n\n\n\nFinally, this phone reminds me of year 2002 when I bought nokia 6600. This phone made me nostalgic...\n\n\nAnyways, wrapping.. This is a review of brand new phone.. i will keep on updating this review every two - three months.. Fingers crossed .. nd hope for the best..\n\nBut for now.. Kudos to ITel",
            "Very useful backup mobile, superb voice quality and 4g hotspot is cherry on the top.\n\nInstead of data card or dongles go for this. I using from 1 week and its speed is top notch and continues. Haven't face any problem till now.\n\nFeature phone can easily provide such features nowadays but due to monopoly and fishy policies they are not providing. Thanks to #itel for this innovative.\n\n#Must have.",

So... simply I would say an excellent product and thanks to the manufacturer doing the right job. Thanks",
            "This is a best alternative for 4G dongle or data card at a decent price. But the performance is not good since it restarts every time I turn the hotspot on. Also battery should be improved despite the auto on/off feature. Overall not bad, can go for its build quality.",

            "Very good hot spot for 4g connection. That's what my main purpose. Software is good and no hanging... (Jio feature phone is zero stars in that case). Voice call super clarity. Alarm is good, wakes up even the phone is switched off. Fine finish and good tactile feel. The best 4g feature phone with hot spot and Bluetooth.",

            "This is my 3rd magic2 device. I have a small development team so I am basically using this phone as a hotspot device only. I have Airtel/Jio hotspots at the same price point but were useless. Waste of money.\nSo I ordered this.\n\nThe product originally delivered has some fault. Its wifi was working but hardly giving me a speed of 7-10mbps and a battery backup of 5-6 hrs. Whereas my experience with same devices was quite different.\nI own two more same phones and both giving me 20+ mbps speed with 8-10hrs of battery backup.\nSo I call for replacement and got the expected product.\n\nKudos to itel",
            "I purchased this phone as an add on.. The sole reason was it\u2019s a 4g phone with hotspot feature. Build and finish is good\nCamera: Horrible. Don\u2019t buy this for camera.\nBattery: very decent battery. I had left the phone with hotspot switched on.. it lasted much more than my jiofi\nNetwork: Excellent 4g Reception. I have compared with my iPhone 11,galaxy s8, Moto G5,Note 6 pro MI it just beats them hands down. This even surprised me.\n\nDisplay: The company could have gone for a better display. This is a real 1990 1st gen colour display. Anyways text and images are legible. Colour reproduction not so good.\n\nCan\u2019t play YouTube. That\u2019s sad\n\nTo summarise this is good feature phone. Buy if you are looking for one.\n\nThe company should consider other platforms as OS. I mean there are so many strip down versions of android, Symbian is still there. I think with those the company can make wonderful things. One landmark phone which the company can copy is Samsung Monte.",
            "Product is nice and mind-blowing but if YouTube and whatsapp is also added then no key pad phone beat itel4g display is nice curved shape flipkart service is very good and very fast",

Nokia used to be really very good before they sold their business. Their symbian OS was really good. I still have nokia 5310 which is still functioning but due to battery unavailability unable to use it. To replace this i bought banana phone with kai OS which is very slow and buggy. So bought this one in exchange of banana. I was surprised and impressed when i started using this phone. The software is really good. All the features are working. Customizations work. There is no lag in operation its quick and smooth. Wifi hotspot works. HD calls are loud enough and clear. Battery backup is good. Looks and color is also good. Display is sharp and clear. But do not expect dslr quality image from camera. This is not a camera phone. I've seen ppl cribbing for camera clarity. Wireless fm is good. Internal memory is enough only for contacts and smses but can be expanded by adding memory card. Overall this can close nokia's feature phone industry again which is palgued by slow buggy software and expensive phones.",

And if almost idle (with infrequent calls) it can stay upto 2 and a half days and even more.\n\nHowever I have used itel feature phones before and i can assure you this is not their best.\nYou see, itel phones in my opinion are the only ones which can make your life much more easier with things like \"make your custom music list and reach it directly with one click\", \"being able to install java apps\", \"being fast cause its a feature phone\"etc. Having simple things like these ultimately decide if a phone is good or bad.\nThis phone doesn't have these kind of things.\nIt does a however support mp4 and 3gp videos in mid resolutions i.e. around 480p. But then again, viewing angles matter a lot. It contains a ebook reader which pretty good but then again only txt format and html is available.\nThe camera is excellent for a feature phone. It almost gave a budget smartphone like quality. Data connection depends on your location and other factors, but no technical issues faced.\nFinally, this is a good phone for calls and hotspot.",

            "If you travel in the interiors of India, there will be many places where your primary sim doesn't have network. There will be many places where you have only BSNL. Many paces where you have Jio in addition to BSNL. If you want an additional phone for such visits but don't want to lug around an expensive and large smartphone, it's best to have a 4G enabled feature phone as Jio wouldn't work on a 2G phone. Also one of the best kept secrets about BSNL is that it's providing 4G services in many interior locations (why it doesn't do so in metros and big towns is anyone's guess) and if the feature phone isn't 4G enabled, you will not be able to make use of that. And if you are going to need whatsapp and email on your main phone or a laptop, you need the second phone to function as a Wifi Hotspot. The Itel Magic ticks all boxes. For about the price of a wifi dongle, you get a feature phone that doubles up as a wifi hotspot. The phone doesn't have whasapp but you can continue using the wahtsapp on your main phone by connecting it to the hotspot. When one looks at the lternatives, there is simply no other 4 enabled feature phone with hotspot function at even double the price of the Itel Magic 4G. The phone has excellent battery life too and I like the looks of it as well as the convenience - you can put it in your trouser pocket and won't even notice that it's there. All in all an excellent innovative product.",

However, I am not able to run any video, possibly due to video file format issue. I wrote this to the agency but they didn't bother to reply.\nLastly the reliability part need to be seen.",

            "First of all don't mix the review with overall rating that I have given to itel magic2 4g.. i.e. 5star as the product deserves 5* no matter what review talks about. My purpose of review is just to share what I could have wished more from product and there are only pros that one can see in the price v/s utility of this product. Go for it without even reading below you won't regret your choice if your prime use is basic calling and to have carrier independent hotspot\n\n1. Camera - didn't click single photo yet but vga resolutions are not to be tested these days.\n2. UI comfort- nice user friendly considering that it is keypad phone. Messaging could have had emojis but not a prime concern.\n3. Features - with Bluetooth I cannot answer from Bluetooth that let me down a little. Wish there could have been an update feature like nokia 215 4g but this is outstanding nokia without update as well.\n4. Sound - speaker is typical feature phone speaker which distorts over 60% volume.\n5. Connectivity - true 4g speed you get on hotspot and hotspot offers you device restriction features as well to allow only whitelisted devices to use hotspot. Wish browser could have supported java script but that is too much of ask I would say from product at this price. Mind you it has dual VoLTE dual standby. I wish it could have given option to select default calling sim selection feature which is why I have to press calling button twice each time I have to make call.\n6. Battery - so far without hotspot it went well around 3 days with average calling of 30mins daily. With hotspot I could download close to 1gb with 60% battery so yes it drains battery if hotspot is something that you are going to use more. My office work consumes 1.5gb of daily use which I think it can last woth full charge.\n\nAll in all go for it as you are still reading this review. Itel Magic2 4g costs same as other hotspot devices also cost this much and this one is carrier independent and can serve as hotspot for any sim that you may have",

Mocor OS had decent customization options. you won't regret buying , infact you will love your purchase and hold it dear for years to come :). itel serves in many countries. and service network also good in hyderabad.",
