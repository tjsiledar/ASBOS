            "This phone will be known for its camera and design for sure. Battery back up could have better and Vivo need to do better in videography.Still photos are simply superb. The absence of dual speaker is a point of concern.\n\nNo smartphone is perfect till date hence this phone too has certain drawbacks apart from having many advantages.\n\nIn short if someone is looking for a phone with excellent design and great still photography can go for this phone.",
            "Writing this review after using this for 5 months\n\nComing from One plus 6T, was pretty spectical about the OS performance and regular updates, but Fun touch OS has been evolved a lot , with providing regular intervals of security updates and very less amount of Advertisement on third-party apps.\n\nSnapdragon 870 works like butter, without any sluggishness and no heating issue, even on extensive usage. Since the OS has been optimised a lot and with 120hz screen refresh rate, the experience is quite good.\n\nThe AMoled display is punchy and little bit on higher saturated side, but watching full HD or 4K content looks pretty good. The side bezzeles are pretty slik.\n\nThe back looks stylish, with corina glass 5 protection, feels sturdy and the weight is pretty less, for which even with cover for longer usage, it does not feel very heavy.\n\nThe battery is moderate, since my usage is on the heavier side, with only 120hz refresh rate, the battery back up is not that great, but with 33W flash charge, it juice up , pretty fast.\n\nThe Zeiss collaboration is quite nice, though it does not have gimble stabilization and T* coating on the lens, but default OIS is quite sufficient. The night mode is quite effective if hands are not shaky. In daylight, pictures are quite sharp, but bit on higher saturation side. Selfies come pretty sharp even on low light or in video calls as well.\n\nIn smartphone industry, finally Vivo is producing some killer products.",

Apart from that it's a good buy. Battery life is gr8. Lasts me almost 1.5 day. Phone is fast enough. Display is quite rich. Will add more after a months use.\nAlmost a month now...Found basic UI issues in the phone, the phone got warm only the first day, prob coz of high usage.\nThe camera is amazing. It is definitely worth buying. Hoping to see the new Origin OS in Vivo X60 soon.\nBattery still lasts 1.5 days with bluetooth on.\nReducing ratings from 4-3. After last update my camera isn't that great. Not buying a Vivo again. My 3 year old one+6 takes much less time to update the apps.",

After last update my camera isn't that great. Not buying a Vivo again. My 3 year old one+6 takes much less time to update the apps.",
            "Very nice mobile Amazing Camera fully satisfied with this mobile,\n\nPros:\n1. Camera\n2. Display\n3. Battery backup also good\n4. Flash Charge (10-100 within 60-70min)\n\nCons:\n1. Bloatware but you can uninstall it\n\nOverall its very nice phone\n\nI have worst experience with Flipkart delivery got delayed, i was directly went to hub to collect my pack and they said we need to search the packet even though it got reached one day before to them on second visit i got it by self delivery and also they charged 1700/- extra for mobile exchange without any proper reason.",
            "It's a good deal to buy this mobile. Battery can run for a day even if you are heavy internet surfer. Gaming is smooth. Portrait in low light doesn't give better image. Better to use Google camera or TR camera apps which gives top notch quality pics. Phone doesn't look weight even with smoky backcase. If you can spend 40+k then try x70 pro instead of X60. Compared to one plus photography, vivo X series gives better quality images.",

Over all performance is nice.. only downside I can see is battery..it drains very fast...\nUpdate after 2 weeks of using\n1. Speaker is not that good as compared to the price\n2. Performance is okay..no issue is heavy gaming like Asphalt 9, COD PES\n3. Camera is really good\n4. I found few basic things are missing..like there is no file manager, calendar.. you can download 3rd party apps but they will keep showing ads which is irritating sometimes.\n5. Absolutely no theme or font available for free... So you need to use default one.\n6. Vibration haptic feedback is of poor quality...you need to turn it off else you won't get premium feel.\n7. Doesn't heat much while gaming.\n8. Camera photos take atleast 1 sec to process while applying filter or any other camera function. Don't know if the 12 gb ram or sd870 is upto the mar or not..",

Never hanged. Not a gamer. So no comments.\n\nIf you are thinking between x60 and x60 pro just don't spend 9k for curved display and gimical stabilization camera. No difference in photos.

It works normal on tap focus, but the focus slider should work. It works on a much cheaper device as well. Hopefully it will be improved with a software update as I really wished to use this feature.\nThe same goes with playing captured videos. The default video player sometime shows jittery video but the same plays good on VLC media player.\nBattery is decent but it should have been more at this price.\nCharging is also decent. Takes around 1 hour and 15 minutes to charge completely.\nIt's slim and feels great in hand but at the same time its also a bit fragile. So handle it carefully.\nI have a network issue on this mobile that sometimes it automatically gets out of network though you will think it's in network. The customer care helped me by doing some setting changes. But the issue came up again. I have set up a scheduled shutdown and restart every night. With this the issue is managed somehow.\nOverall the performance is great except some improvements that Vivo need to do in this mobile.",
