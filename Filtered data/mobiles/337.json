            "Everything thing is gud at this price. The phone is fully worth it. Nd even comparing this model with the other smartphones offer by the Chinese company like oppo-vivo-redmi-realme is not that much fair as Lava is an Indian company which don't have that much financial support like those companies. Yet by this model it is clear that the company is trying very hard to compete with the others. Although no one will deny that their is a large scope of improvement specially in the software.\n\nHardware is pretty gud. Except the processor they must go for the chipset of Qualcomm or MediaTek that will improve the performance in much better way.\n\nBut at the last again I will say that u will not face any big issue related to either hardware or software if u use this phone for the modrate work.\n\nSupport Make in India. Let's change vocal into global.",

In this case it beats it's Chinese rivals ,if you are a normal user you can buy this",

Good video calling quality. Screen in crystal clear. Played video on YouTube in 1080 resolution. Viewable from all sides. No distortion in sunlight. Phone looks is gorgeous from back and front. Calling quality is good and voice and volume are good. I don't know why this phone rating is low. I think they are obsessed with redmi realme.

            "Based on the Budget it exceeds expectations. Also, it's an Indian brand which I believe is the most important factor for me. I might have been slightly liberal with the review but I strongly believe if we support by buying Indian brands and give constructive feedback it will bring in good competition to Chinese phones. Having said that couple of constructive feedback. Display and Camera quality can be improved. Also, for future phones lava should seriously consider Type C charging point. Else everything is Good based on its budget..",
            "Nice mobile colours are awesome I love this mobile\nBest thing I love it that it is an made in India and Indian company mobile... its battery does not discharge easily... I play free fire in this mobile and I am shocked to see that the game does not got a single lag ... now who said that Indian mobiles are very bad.. two things I hate in this mobile that we cannot hide apps and we cannot put app lock on this mobile .... other things are very awesome in this mobile... so go for this mobile\n#vocal for local...... also we didn't got mobile cover in it",
            "I am writing this review after using Lava Z66 for 1 week. When I inserted my Jio sim the Internet was working fine but the VoLTE was not working. There was no any option of enabling VoLTE in this phone, but when I inserted another Jio sim all the functions was working and the same Sim which was not working in this set, was working fine in my honor 7a phone. I replaced the Sim from Jio store then VoLTE activated but sms was not working. It was activated three days before.\nOther features like camera, battery backup is superb. Finger touch processing is little bit slow.\nI may suggest to purchase this phone. It is a budget phone.",
