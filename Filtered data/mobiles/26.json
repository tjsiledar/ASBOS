            "Best in this price band, I bought for my sister, and she loved it.... Camera is perfect for this price range, decent performance, buttery smooth experience as it has 90hertz display.. Just one thing, if there would be a wide angle lens, it would be better, but no issue.. Go for it",
            "Great phone under budget for gaming and for taking pictures. For PUBGM/BGMI players you should know that this device has gyroscope delay(5000milisec) but while playing BGMI in Graphic:smooth FPS:ultra(40) works well without lags... And tbh this is a great gaming phone under budget.",

            "Honest Review after 7 Days..\nLet's start with cons\n1. No notifications light (except charging)\n2. Noise cancellation of phone mic is not so impressive\n3. Lots of Bloatware which you can't uninstall\n4. Game boost mode crashes every time while trying to launch\n\nOk now pros\n\n1. Phone is big, I mean really big\n2. Battery life And charging time is best in class\n3. It comes with 90hz refresh rate but i am using it at 60 hz And it works flawless\n4. Sound quality of speaker is best\n\nHonestly at this price you can definitely go for it",
            "This mobile is budget beast... Good processor with good camera, awesome battery but I'm giving 4 stars because it has not that much satisfactory day to day performance... One can see little bit lags like switching in multiple tabs and so on, rather than this this has really awesome gaming performance too....\nI'll suggest all andriod users to go with it as in future they may fix issues of lag with updates.",

            "Review after 10 days..\nDisplay is awesome, 90 hz actually works. Viewing angles are also good and there is no colour shift.\nCamera is good, tries to capture every minute detail even in low light because of wide aperture.\nPerformance is very fast, G88 works too good in daily tasks.\nRam management is not great but it is ok for overall perspective.\nBattery takes about 2 hrs to charge from 20-100% and lasts 1 day easily and 1.25 days when u turn on power marathon. Warms little bit but no overheating issue.\nThere is no any lag and bugs in UI, but u have to spend some time to uninstall and disable some bloatwares to avoid ads.\nSound is great, crisp and clear. Strereo effect is there but not that much balanced like high end phones. Loud enough like mini bt speaker.\nOverall If u are looking VFM phone in this price range, u should go for it...",

Phone Looks Decent , The camera design looks premium wish It didn't have glossy back\n2. rear camera is Inconsistent Sometimes it captures so much detail sometimes itne photo Quality is bit bad\n3. Night performance is excellent due to 1.6 Aperture .. The beauty mode is good , Portrait mode is good , Color science is good ,\n4. in night it sometimes make photos look way too bright which might be issue\n5. out of the box fron camera is decent but after updates it performs good ( keep in mind it has a fixed focus camera)\n6.Phone is currently running on January security patch which is really good\n7. Phone feels smooth\n8. display is on cooler side nd I haven't found the feature to make the display bit warmer , Reading mode might help\ndue to cooler side display the color looks bit less punchy\n9. Buttons are good\n10. Speaker is good dual speaker but it's not super loud.. has depth in sound which is nice\n11. Phone is easy to hold.. decent grip\n12. software isn't that heavy I would say compared to previous infinix device it has improved a lot , The UI is feature rich nd smooth\n13. Has front nd back flash on both camera.. back flash is really bright\n14.No 4g aggregation\n15. Refresh rate feels smooth there are no zitters mostly\n\n\nWill update if I face any issues",

But at this price mi has no similar phone so it is ok.\nThere is no hide folder option.

No problem in this side (9/10)\n3. Nice case and screen guard provided in box\n\n\nNagatives:\n\n1. Pathetic UI! Lot of unnecessary notification and default launcher shows 10 apps as ad on top! I have to use another launcher in order get rid of it. There are many customisation available and it's useful! Performance is good! It's ad making it annoying so use another launcher and you good to go. (7/10)\n\n2. Cameras! Oh god don't believe on 50MP. It's not so good but I believe all mobiles under 10k are having this issue. This only bothers when you've used good camera mobiles.\n\nApart from these, everything is good, no issue at all!\n\nFor whom this mobile is ideal? For non-techie parents and for children.
