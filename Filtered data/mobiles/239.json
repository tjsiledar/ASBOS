            "The design is similar to the famous Nokia 6300 with 16 million color screen display. One among the most pathetic products offered by HMD global under Nokia brand. For the price they are selling it at, the single speaker for ear piece and music/ringtone is awfully low in sound. The speakers should be audible enough if not then what's the purpose of feature phone? The screen is decent enough and the wireless fm is good feature to have. Never saw a Nokia feature phone (previously made by Microsoft/hmd or the original NOKIA itself) with just 6 ringtones in it.",
