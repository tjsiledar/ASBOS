            "It\u2019s my first iPhone ever and I bought it with my earned money through part time jobs in college\u270c\ufe0f\n\nI am a tech freak so you can trust my views -\n- A14 Bionic is the fastest, most efficient and reliable processor till date\n- The camera focuses so quickly that you can take DSLR quality photos.\n- The screen size 6.1 inches is the most comfortable screen size out there and the OLED retina XDR display is so crisp and everything feels real.\n- The stereo speakers are so clear even on high volume and gives awesome vibe while listening to music\n- iOS has no bugs at all\n- 20W charging is lit \ud83d\udd25\n- The Face ID feels like having no lock for yourself, there\u2019s no issue while using Face ID even in the dark because it uses infrared rays to scan the face\n\nDrawbacks -\n- Battery could be better",

            "I really m glad that i went for i phone in place of all other android devices like the Samsung S series nd one plus .\nAlso , m amazed by the battery life in this i phone . Single charge and its last for a day easily ..\nEven the gaming experience was great",
            "This was an awesome buy. I bought this phone for my father who was upgrading from an iPhone 6. He is very happy with this phone. The size is really good. He said that it was even more comfortable to hold than the 6 as it had flat sides. It is Smaller than most android phones but big enough for anything and everything.\n\nThe performance is Stellar. You won't notice any lag and it's very fast. Ram management is good too. And the phone stays at a reasonable temperature even when using Gmaps.\n\nThe battery life is good. Not as good as most android phones but the efficiency of this processor is really good. You will have to buy a charger for 1800 rupees and that is a genuine inconvenience. Even though it charges at a good rate when charged using my mac mini usb c port.\n\nThe camera is awesome. It takes some awesome photos and the video is just pure wizardry. It drains battery pretty fast while recording 4k videos which is expected due to the heavy processing and HDR it is doing. 30 fps videos can be shot at dolby vision HDR.\n\nThe display doing 60hz is fine. It's very bright and sharp. You will get used to the notch in no time. 120hz would've been appreciated though. Speakers too are awesome. Stereo speakers make it very enjoyable. The haptics is next level and i am very happy with it.",

            "Switched from Android to iPhone and this transition was really smooth due to its easier GUI. I bought this 128 Gb variant and Didn\u2019t waited for iPhone 13 as iPhone 12 has all ,what one need in a perfect phone. In person white colour seems much sexier than purple and black.

            "Overall performance of the phone is good as expected from Apple, but there is major overheating problem with the phone with minor usage and during charging(even with authentic 20w charger). The phone feels real hot even with minor usage especially on upper left side and left side. During charging, the phone gets very hot(not warm, like literally hot), so i have to plug out the charger after 10 minutes to avoid further heating. I don\u2019t know if the problem is only with my device or its general, but one should be careful before investing on it.",
            "After being a long time samsung user i switched to iphone again after iphone 4s and i am thoroughly enjoying it. Ios 14 is much polished and android users will surely enjoy using ios now. Battry lasts a day with moderate use. Performance, usability, camera, sound and display everything is top notch.

            "So far so good. It\u2019s my dream to own an iPhone for over a decade. Finally came true with iPhone 12. Previously owned Samsung S9 plus so competing with android i will say my likes and dislikes.\n\nLikes:\n1. OS is really fluid\n2. Security features like facial recognition for app installation etc\n3. Little nuances like ringtone sound reduction automatically after I see the mobile\n4. Camera is good though still equal to Samsung can\u2019t say extraordinary\n5. Facial unlock is really quick\n6. 5G ready so future proof\n7. Performance is extraordinary with so many apps opened but still fluid performance\n8. Very light weight\n9. OS update for next 5 years\n10. Compared to S9 plus I like this battery better\nDislikes:\n1. Not happy with the screen compared to S9 plus\n2. Less customisation\n3. Siri is not fully developed like \u2018hey Google\u2019\n\nThese are my own experience. If you are like me and want to try iOS you can definitely do it. Less chances for you to regret it.",
            "What a amazing phone ! I bought this amazing beast for my soul mate & she\u2019s very happy and blissful.\nWonderful camera , beautiful design must buy worth every penny",
            "I have been a pixel lover and pixel user for so many years. The only reason for shifting to Apple was the ease of content creation on iOS environment.\nGoogle hasn't been launching new pixel devices in India for almost 3 years now and that is really disappointing. My review is based upon the difference between the 2.\n\nApple lovers may not like my review but even though there is a lot of difference between google and apple, I've still rated the phone as a 4 star product.\n\nI will start with...\n\n***** Camera *****\n\nStill photography is still much better on a pixel device. In fact, the pixel 4a clicks better stills than iPhone 12 (as per my experience). However, pixels video quality has been really disappointing. Specially with front camera. This is where iPhone beats pixel. You are not just going to click stills but also would like to take good quality videos. Content creation is all about cameras that are good in doing the both. Hence, I would say iPhone beats pixel because of the video quality and a good (not the best) still photography.\n\n\n***** Battery Backup *****\n\nAmazing!! Just amazing! Again, this is based on the comparison between iOS and Android. I've heard that battery backup on iPhone 12 is not that good but someone who is coming from and Android environment will notice a considerable difference. You can opt for iPhone 11 if battery is a major issue for you.\n\n\n***** Siri vs. Google Assistant *****\n\nSiri is no where around GA. There's a legitimate reason for this. Google has been collecting data for so many years. Hence, the GA is smart enough to respond to and act accordingly. Context switching is what I miss when I use iPhone 12. But that's Google vs Apple and not something that is related to iPhone 12. So chill!!\n\n***** Look & Feel *****\n\n5 stars! Hands down!\n\n\nI bought it for 48k during BBD sale. To be honest, that should be the true price of this phone. IT IS NOT WORTH 80K!!",
            "First time in my life I'm trying iphone, I'm an android Samsung note user. There are no powerful android phones which are compact to use single handedly..that's the main reason I'm living the iPhone. I didn't go for the 12 Pro max as it is ginormous in size and the 12 mini was reviewed to have sub par battery life. 12 and 12 Pro are the ideal phones for the best of both worlds. I didnt need the telephoto and Lidar camera, so I went with 12 to save some thousands. I'm enjoying the single handed use, power of A14 bionic chip and the awesome cameras. Luckily this 12 unlike iPhone 11 has amoled screen and it looks crisp and vivid. Battery life has amazed me with easily 1.5 days of usage on any given day. It doesn't have fast charging like android but I can live with it. Final verdict, I dont regret choosing this phone.",
            "Switched from Android to iOS and won\u2019t regret a bit. This one of the best devices have used in a while.\n\nPros:\n\n1. Performance is super snappy, no lags whatsoever.\n2. Battery performance is pretty good too. M not a heavy user so currently charging it once every two days.\n3. Haven\u2019t used camera much but pretty sure it\u2019s splendid too.\n4. Size is spot on, neither too big nor too small. Very easy to use in one hand.\n5. Display is good too. One note though, for those feeling display is too warm should turn off True Tone and adjust colour setting under accessibility.\n\nCons:\n\nPrice: Agree it\u2019s bit pricey, but if you enter apple\u2019s ecosystem then it\u2019s worth it.\n\nOverall, if you can afford, just go for it.",
            "It\u2019s a very light phone I totally loved the performance of this phone Shifting from android to IOS has some initial challenges but now I am use to it its a perfect fit phone in hand\nBattery is pretty good for normal use I you and not fond of watching Videos and play games it last for 1.5 days with some gaming and video its manage to last a day.\nCamera is super awesome in day light and performs pretty well on Night also.",
            "price range is not for everyone but if you can afford it don't hesitate a bit because this phones gives you most realistic camera, stunning filters, efficient battery life, multimedia files take low storage, applications run smoothly and last but best part is the security features for messaging and payments.\n\nI am not asking everyone to buy it but if you can afford an apple phone then you should always go for it without giving a second thought",
            "Was using the OnePlus 7 pro before this, it was a 2 year old device but still had better battery backup than this Iphone. Rest you all know its an iphone, great camera, nice screen, ios is very smooth and consistent which many android phones lack, Face ID is a pain during Covid and boy they don't give charger which sucks.\nOverall a nice phone, battery should have been better",
            "Upgraded from iPhone X.Noticed 3 major differences instantly.\n\n1. Lot of difference in camera pictures. The best camera model from iPhone so far\n2. Light weight and feels very handy during one hand use\n3. Screen brightness is better than iPhone X\n\nNot mentioning about other aspects like performance , speed as they already are close to perfect.\n\nBattery - not more than one complete day after constant usage of WhatsApp, safari, emails, spotify music & youtube videos",

Camera is the best no need to worry about that...the bionic A14 chip is fast no lags or anything screen is good too...ummm everything is fine but if u want to try something new don't go for iphone...that's my opinion...",
            "Overall a good experience. Takes sometime to get used to iOS if you're coming from android. The display is good, looks natural. I turned off true tone as I felt it made the display warmer than I like. Also you might find the colours not very saturated if you're coming from a Samsung phone.\nBattery is very good, lasts an entire day and more for me. Camera is also pretty good.",
            "Finally moved from Android (OnePlus 7T) to iOS & it\u2019s a different level. Display is outstanding. Camera superb as usual. But surprised with the battery performance, its really great. Only drawback is the missing of 90Hz display, missed the fluidity of that. May be with time will habituated with that. But it\u2019s worth noting. Overall an awesome luxurious experience from a luxurious brand.",
            "Moved to iPhone from Android since cupcake days and I\u2019m loving it so far. Brilliant display, camera and performance. IOS is still a little behind Android in terms of features and shortcuts in my opinion but it\u2019s very close. Still getting used to all the features of iOS. Per-ordered on the launch day and it arrived barely on time. Overall happy with the purchase.",
            "Migration from android to iOS, very much exited to use this phone and the quality of the camera is very good, faster and m very happy with the product. Request to send the proper bill along with the product n that is the only concern I have. Thank you.",

Once I got the product first thing I did was to check the serial number in the apple website and confirm the originality of the product. I was very happy as everything was perfect.\n\nNow coming to the packing ,it was packed well and no damage was there. My old Samsung phone was exchanged for a good price and was also picked up by them.\n\nI am really enjoying my first iPhone. Battery i am getting one full day with full charge. No issues as of now. Will post the second review after I use this phone for few days. Overall this purchase is value for money.",

            "Writing this review after 50 days of \u2018heavy\u2019 use.\n\n\u2022 The performance is just flawless. I played BGMI usually 6-7 hrs daily for 25-30 days (both classics and tournaments) with screen recording and never got even a single framedrop.\n\n\u2022 Battery performance is also good. While playing heavy games continuously it gives a backup of around 4hrs and around 3-1/2 hrs with screen recording. If u are not playing heavy games then the battery will last all day long and there will be still left around 20% by the end of the day.\n\n\u2022 Camera performance is excellent in good light conditions and in low light is also good but could\u2019ve been better since the shutter limit in night mode is only 10secs but its enough.\n\n\u2022 Display is lovely. I have compared it to that of iphone11\u2019s and yes it is noticeably better.",

Camera, display, looks, performance, smooth interface is all that makes iphones standout from rest. And iphone 12 delivers all that you require. Though iPhone's battery has always been the downside. Apple if you are listening we need much more larger battery capacity and you wont have to face any competition.\nAnd thankfull we didn't get Nirma soap in our box\ud83d\ude02",

            "Definitely an awesome product...an awesome experience if you are upgrading from android.... Bgmi experience is unmatched...\nThe performance and day to day activities on the mobile is way different than any other can offer....\nMy suggestion is ..if you can afford it....you may go if you are a lover of quality over quantity..\nBattery is okay...neither like it cant even run few hours nor like it will run till days...in between...you can take it with a little over mild usage....for 6 to 7 hours...\nFor spectators......not much of a difference between 11 and 12....\n\n\nIt was my dream....and after a lot of reasons not to buy... I went for it...\nHave to pay 10k a month for the next 6 month....\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\nBut still...looking and using it daily....will give me a reason to work hard and earn everyday....\n\nPS- purple, red and blue is better if u want people not to misunderstand it with 11....\nBut this color is just love \ud83d\udc95",
            "Save few bucks and buy this and avoid 13. Used this for a year and great compact beast if you got money to waste else restrict yourself for under 30k androids.\nNot having great of everything but still best as it got everything you need in top notch phone.",

            "Great service by Flipkart. Iphone 12 is just awesome. The only con is they must provide charger. The battery is not that much great but works for a day if sufficiently charged.",
            "Pros:\n- Same screen quality compared to 12 Pro. Features are also mostly similar except for a few (for example, three back cameras instead of two), which is not a matter of concern for me.\n- Consistent and super-smooth user experience of iOS. (If you are looking for feature richness, better to go with Android)\n- Predictable battery life. This means, if your phone is on standby with 2% battery left, you will see the almost same battery percentage even after 2 hours.\n- Square-shaped design comparing to iPhone 11 brings a little more compact feel. Also, the phone is lighter.\n\nCons:\n- iPhone 13 is getting released this month. But, still, feature-wise, not much difference unless you are not going for 13 Pro (120Hz refresh screen). So, this may still provide value if the prices are reduced.\n- Not much difference between iPhone 11, except the OLED screen, compared to LED. You will not notice the difference if you are not spending too much time in bright conditions. Practically, not much difference in Battery life either.\n\nConclusion:\nFor an average user, I feel the experience with the Phone will be similar for iPhone 11, iPhone 12 and iPhone 13. So, make the decision based on budget.\n- If you are looking for a substantially better value comparing to iPhone 11, go with iPhone 13 pro because of its 120 Hz variable refresh rate if your budget allows it.\n- Go with iPhone 12 if you value square design. Otherwise, iPhone 11 will be a better choice for a cheaper cost.\n- Spending on iPhone 13 doesn't make much sense for me comparing the features and design with iPhone 12. Buy iPhone 12 if you don't have the budget for iPhone 13 Pro.",
            "My first ios device. Oh boy this is a great device. I am so glad that I made the switch. The only thing I miss is the fast refresh rate of android but it\u2019s not as bad as it sounds due to fluidity of ios\n\nCameras are excellent but not as sharp as newer android phones with bigger megapixels. But the quality and color accuracy of pictures are great.\n\nBattery life is also good. It would run a day and charges upto 90 percent in an hour.\n\nThe display is gorgeous. One of the best.",
            "Awesome product\u2026\nCamera: it\u2019s superb.\nBattery : quite good and runs for whole day if moderately use.\nDisplay and design : perfect. iPhone 12 is looking so premium and best till date.\nPerformance: perfect and very smooth and premium.\nColour: i prefer Green because it looks more light green and different than others and ofcourse it gives premium look\u2026 2nd option can be white.\nFlipkart order : firstly I hesitated to buy from flipkart as it is of bug amount but I ordered and got my phone one day before promise date. I\u2019ve checked everything about phone. And I\u2019ve found a super se upar phone . I must recommend it.\nThank you flipkart\u2026 I\u2019m loving it so much\u2764\ufe0f",
            "This is my first Apple product and obviously I was very excited before unboxing it. The phone feels very premium and truly goes with the brand. Each and every specification of the phone is worth the money. So just go ahead and purchase it without any second thought. I pre-ordered it and received the product on time. Thanks Flipkart for prompt service.",
            "Best ever Mobile. Worth every penny. Overall a good purchase. Processor is superfast. Loved it",
            "My final review after using it for whole one week. Awesome Was a Hard Androider but as I switched really loving iOS Know. Guys the product is geniune please those who are saying flipcart is fake and all. Belive me it's an trustworthy Family. I thanks My seller and the entire team of Flipcart Thank you so much. Regards.",
            "Worth the money invested. My first iPhone and it could not have been better than this. The look, the ease of use, the security and the display+camera it's just awesome.",
            "As switched from an android to ios it's worth upgrading .However ,there are some things particularly in iOS which i dislike for instance,it's a big challenge to transfer your data to a laptop unless it's a MacBook. Overall i can say the camera quality is top notch and processor which we all know it's the fastest chip yet furthermore the security we get is far better than android devices moreover thanks to flipkart for delivering the product earlier than the scheduled date.",
            "Firstly I would like to thanks Flipkart for one day delivery with secure & safe. Its realy awesome phone. I loved it. This is my first IPhone which I have swep from android to ios. White colour provide premium look. Tea Cup Pic is from IPhone 12",
            "I recently upgraded to the iPhone 12 and I have no regrets. The phone is very sleek, streamlined and svelte looking, especially in the red color, which I prefer.\nThe phone works flawlessly, with great audio and a decent speaker, for voice or music. The text feature, likewise, is extremely easy to use and intuitive. The phone takes excellent pictures, rivaling many stand-alone cameras and equipment, and the panoramic feature is very useful and cool. The other apps work great as well and open quickly and seamlessly. Personally, I\u2019ve always really enjoyed apple products.",
            "Review after 15 days: Upgraded from iPhone X\nExcellent phone with amazing battery back up, easily last a day with high usage.\nFast charging is also great. Charged 30% to > 80% within 30 mins.\nNot to mention Camera quality. All iPhone have great camera quality. But upgrading from iPhone X, this phone\u2019s camera quality is even better with better crispness and great in low light.\nLED screen is pretty awesome. You can get great pictures and videos steaming.\nDesign is pretty awesome. Flat edges gives me nostalgic feeling of using iPhone 5s.\nPhone is pretty light weight.\nOverall best iPhone to buy as of now. \ud83e\udd29",
            "An apple fan, I find iPhone 12 light, easier to use than iPhone 11 as is compact in size and weight, display is a little better than iPhone 11, speed is also better and satisfactory. To my disappointment; there was no charger and no earphones in the box. Also the price strategy of apple for its products in india is positioned much higher than the developed countries while it should have been the other way round as the capacity to pay of people of developing nations like india is much lower than US and Europe. I see it unfair on part of apple and completely unjustified.",
            "The most value for money iPhone of 2021 after the iPhone 12 mini. Flipkart just killed it with their pricing and offers on these iPhones. Would definitely recommend to both iOS and android users. Good enough cameras, nice display with slim and \u201cequal\u201d bezels, overall a really great experience",
            "Got an iphone 12 128gb green colour as I expected thanks for flipcart. And when it comes to phone iphone is good and i love purple colour but i got green but it's ok when it comes to its performance and camera excellent and battery backup and charging speed is also good..\ud83d\udcad\u2665\ufe0f",
            "Well I bought this at 67k..using Amex discount! Lucky enough for that. Thanks FK & Amex\nMow coming to the device and specifically to its camera, its over hyped according to me!\nI have watched a lot of reviews and all those sweet things about camera and pic quality but there are some caveats.\n1. Picture gets pixelated when you try to zoom in even after 30 to 40% of actual image\n2. Though the device houses the fastest chip across the globe (at the time of release), it still take couple of seconds to process the image\n3. Ultra wide is just average\n\nWell, since the aperture of camera is good, night shot does come great!!\n\nMy primary reason of buying this phone was for camera but m not very satisfied.",
            "This is my first iPhone after being an android guy for last 10yr. Main reason for the switch was, having an Macbook and airpod already. So wanted to experience synergy between apple products in its ecosystem. Here is my 2 week review\nPros\n1. Screen Quality is great. My last phone was Oneplus 7, so jump in screen quality was noticeable\n2. Performance. This phone with iOS feels extremely fluid. The old phone feels not so snappy compared to it. Also, since i have never used a 90Hz display so didn\u2019t feel anything missing\n3. Battery life. There were lot of threads online putting doubt in my mind about battery life of iPhone12. But am getting much better battery life than my OnePlus 7. >6h screen time. Also the standby time is excellent allowing the phone to easily last whole day with 50% charge remaining on light usage. I have bluetooth, Siri on always\n4. Form factor and lime green color looks awesome. Smaller than my last phone so feels lighter and easier to hold in hands\n\nCons\n1. Only disappointment was camera performance. I was hoping for magic/ drastic improvements with iPhone camera, but didn\u2019t see any such results\n2. iCloud storage is painfully limited",
            "Nice camera nice design ios is extremely fast as expected.\n\nCons: if you are switching from android 5000mah battery and fast charger like 65w then you are going to face a big problem with battery backup , as apple support 20w fast charger so make a note of it .",
            "What a phone ! Its a beast in terms of performance and great battery life. Love the red colour. Got for a great price ! My first apple phone !",
            "If you are first time ios user u are surely going to miss few things frm android but the sense of security u get frm ios is unquestionable , and about the device its upto the mark the screen is so fluid that u will love it and battery optimisation is also top notch all the games i hv tried run buttery smooth so if u are ready to compromise on some features u can definitely go for it",
            "As always awesome product by Apple and Nice timely and safe delivery by Flipkart.\nFirst confused about colour but as compared with others Red does look Royal",
            "It's maintaining apple's quality as usual. Good phone and compatibility use. The phone is little bit small when compared to other competitive products. There is no outstanding features in this phone when compare to Samsung or one plus. But I'm sure Apple uses must love this phone. The seller is also very good and they keep promising to deliver things on time for meeting Beyond expectations.",

            "Finally got the most awaited iPhone 12 with favourite white. With this purchase I have now a complete Apple products family range includes MacBook IPad and now iPhone 12. Very easy to initiate after denoting the iPhone as I had migrated all the data quickly with signing in.\nWell it was a great deal with Flipkart, off course I got the the phone in two days after placing an order.\nIt\u2019s been a few weeks now using iPhone, it\u2019s different experience altogether.\nThank you Flipkart n Ekart logistics.",
            "Superb phone from apple. Buttery smooth and blazingly fast. Just missing telephoto camera at this price. This could be provided by Apple. Also charger is not coming along. At this price customer expects that.\n\nNothing else to complain about. It is very good looking, compact and light weight. Master piece from Apple.",

            "Providing review after 1 month of use .. no doubt it\u2019s a good mobile handling is very smooth n performance is very good as well front camera is descent back camera is awesome with a nice detailing\u2026 cons battery life is not very long proper use of phone may need charging once in every 10 hours \u2026 if you lay down and try to open the phone by face recognition then it doesn\u2019t work .. you need to hold the phone flat parallel to your bed then it opens up.",

            "Its a very good phone having fastest processor A14 bionic and a very good camera along with beautiful super retina xdr display. Handles daily task like a charm. Also water and dust resistant make it worth every penny.\nGaming is really good on this phone with high settings.Sound quality is amazing and loud.\n\nios is stable as always and handles ram management impressively, no lags what so ever in games as well as daily tasks.\n\nThe only downside of this device is although apple claim that it has a ceramic shield and all, it easily get scratches on display and body.\nThank you Flipkart for the fast delivery and good packaging.\nOverall its a nice phone go for it!!",

            "Battery is typically like a 4000mah device uses with two sims. ( assuming u use iphone 12 with one sim with location wifi etc off). For office type use its no issue. Field work types people will want more battery for sure. Cameras are good. Apps aren\u2019t bulletproof as they claim. Ola app has bugs. Doesn\u2019t hang. But its still not as fast fluid as one plus. Its not slow mind it. But the buttery transitions on ios make it relatively slow. Speakers have bass sorta.",
            "I am switching from Android to iOS after almost 8yrs of android phones usage.\nOverall I really liked the iPhone 12 due to its seamless high quality display and greater performance.\n\nPros:\n1. Display quality\n2. Performance\n3. Great features/inbuilt apps from iOS\n4. Camera in good light\n5. Build quality\n6. User friendly interface\n\nCons:\n1. Heats up very fast after few mins of camera use and gaming.\n2. Battery drains very fast within few hrs of continuous use for WFH so you need wireless fast charger for sure.\n3. Camera and pic quality is good but few flagship mobiles gives even better quality pics\n4. Few basic features from android not available and difficult to adjust\n5. No adapter provided which is additional 1.8k expense.\n6. Basic functionality of Back option not provided at bottom but on top, so you need 2 hands to handle most of the times\n\nI am only giving 3 rating for the seller who have reduced the exchange price of my Old one plus 7 phone just for a small scratch at bottom corner. Old phone was in very good condition with full functioning and no cracks on display as it was only around 1.8 yrs old. Thus I was expecting a full exchange value for it but was disappointed to have 3.3k reduction.",

            "I have bought iPhone as i have been gifted with airpods and now apple watch. So taking about the pros are it has superb screen and camera is way to awesome. I feel UI is better than andriod phone and Siri helps a lot. Cons would be battery backup is not good as compared to andriod phones. Also I bought it for 67999 which is indeed a good amount. Also it only has one sim so you cant use two sim like android. So its upto you to decide which suits you more and buy accordingly.",
            "Received my device today and I must say it is AWESOME. Delivery time was just 16 hours and it was nicely packed.\nThe camera and performance is top notch. Night mode works superb and the design is flawless. I will provide detailed review after few weeks of usage.",

            "My first switch to the iOS ecosystem, been a wonderful with experience. Glad it was with Apple iPhone 12! Great product absolutely loved it.",
            "It is really a nice product by apple but there are some disappointments too. First the battery is small, and that\u2019s why the phone is very light (this is the advantage), If you are updating from iphone 6 or 7 you will not mind but if u are updating from phone 11 then you would definitely find a difference. Second thing the display is not that bright. I compared it with iPhone 11 and 7 plus and saw that 11 and 7 plus both were more bright. Third when we use the camera for like more than 5-10 min the phone starts to heat up, but once we stop using camera the phone cooled down immediately which means it does not affects the battery so no issue. Else the phone is perfect, but I think iPhone 11 is better than iPhone 12. It is just that it is a newer product so people are cutting it. The camera quality of iPhone 12 is lot better than iPhone 11 so if camera is not your priority then you can but iPhone 11 too.",

Both os and apps are very good looking and best in performance.\n\nAlso apple accessories are available everywhere not like other brands whose cases or chargers we can\u2019t find easily.\n\nReally apple is the consumer oriented company and i salute the spirit of steve jobs for his vision towards all of us as due to his efforts we are now having world class technology in our hands... so price doesn\u2019t matter just go for it blindly.",

            "It\u2019s a beauty which comes at a cost. The transition from Android to IOS has been pretty smooth.My views after 20 days of usage are as follows\n1. Amazing display\n2. Excellent camera no comparison with other phones\n3. Very good sound quality\n4. The interface is confusing, will get used to it\n5. Battery is good, could have been better\n6. The design is awesome and very light in weight.Blue Color is really vibrant",
            "Ok let me specify this real quick\nThis device is a beast in every way\nBattery: i charge to 90% in morning at like 7 am and after i return to home at like 9 pm it still has 20-30% juice left in it ( screen on time 6 hrs ) so even if u are a heavy user(except games) the battery is insane for you\n\nDisplay nothing to say :-)\nGaming :)\nCamera :)\nEverything is best so just go for it without any issues\nDont spend extra money for iphone 13 its not worth it",
            "The flipkart delivery was good and the delivery guy opened the pack in front of me as per the steps described. He also asked me to check all the checkpoints to identify if phone was in a good condition. Iphone 12 is amazing and had a good battery life. Lasts 1.5 day with normal use and 4g services shut down when not required. Has a amazing processing speed",

Go for iphone 12 however if like to invest 40k more for one more camera, 180 nits brightness difference (which you cannot differentiate b/w both of them) and slight design difference then go for iphone 12 pro.\n\nOtherwise iphone 12 gives you all the features which an individual wants in a good phone.",

            "Great phone. The performance is top notch, no lags in daily usage and UI is butter smooth. Camera is does a good justice too, the best part is it automatically adapts to lighting conditions and turns on night mode. Battery\u2019s lasts for a day with normal usage.",
            "Over a Decade long android user switching to the iPhone for the first time.\n\nFor the longest time i was an android fanboy, on account of being a power user who always wanted to customise things as per my requirement.\n\nI\u2019ve come from using different Sony devices to 3 different OnePlus devices to the Apple iPhone.\n\nI weighed the pros and cons as one would with all the fairness one can impart while making a personal choice of buying a smartphone. Pros being that android was highly customisable, open source-ish, lots of freedom.\n\nCons being the instability of the OS, the apps built on it, the crashes, bugs, etc. And overall the aesthetic being more function-focused and less on beauty.\n\nAs I grew up in life, my priorities changed. And with that, the time and resulting inclination i had for the functional aspect of the phone.\n\nI realised that the number of apps i used on my phone had come down to the handful of basics - such as the dialler, camera, email and a handful of social media apps. This is when I started evaluating the differences between the androids and iPhones of the world and I found myself increasingly siding with the PROS of an apple device whereas caring less and less about the cons of one.\n\nThe iPhone is an incredibly powerful device.\n\n- Camera is best in the business (Sharp lens, true colours, great 4k video, the works..)\n- As long as you can bear the notch, the display is straight gorgeous. The colours are just a class apart and the display PPI and smooth transitions make it an absolute buttery delight.\n- Call quality is superior compared to any android phone I\u2019ve used\n- Compact design (although its got a little bit of weight to it, which might not be an issue for most people seeing as it is well distributed)\n- Stability: Hasn\u2019t crashed/died/hung on me a single time (I\u2019ve seen the most powerful android phones hang and crash at times)\n- The little things: Some incredible gestures (Certain kind of taps that make useful menus pop up, when you immediately switch from one music app to another it gently decreases the volume of your existing music and then gently increases the volume of your new music like a fade out-fade in, and more such things i discover every day).\n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be switching back to another OS as this one just handles everything beautifully.\n\nHope this helps some confused android user who\u2019s wondering whether to pull the trigger and make the switch.",

Phone performance is very slow... My previous sony xperia z is far better than thjs Iphone\n\n2. Basic functions like call also doesnt work properly... Calls disconnects, drops and takes too much time to connext sometimes\n\n3. Mobile Net speed is slow due to signal drop issue.... wifi connection doeant work as expected\n\nAlways some issue and they try to resolve with new update but unfortunately it brings newer issue's, Its make me feel Apple like company dont do proper testing before rolling it to users\n\nWorst mobile and not worth the price.... Apple disappointed very big time",

I made my cousin bought the same phone so that i am not the only idiot letting down our family .\n\nJust to let you know guys, this mobile has sane call quality which a nokia 1100 (15 years old mobile) had.\n\nNow a days i hold my phone in a manner so that the apple logo is visible to everyone, even though i am speaking to my credit card collection team for non payment of my last EMI.\n\nI have stopped watching Zee and Amazon prime these days and switched over to Netflix , Apple TV due to obvious reasons. Now my monthly food expenses is lesser than Netflix yearly subscription.\n\nNow I don\u2019t buy Indian brands and only wear Gucci and Armani (2nd copies) to live upto the standard my iphone 12 has .\n\nBy the way i had to buy the charger for this phone for 2000 bucks . I had to act cool in the store while shelling out my hard earned money.\n\nAnyways, After buying this phone my maid servant has started asking for a pay rise. I am also waiting for my bosses to buy one so that i can ask for a pay rise also.",

            "I am writing this review after 1month!! First of all I would say that this is totally overpowered phone. As I am a gamer I hav youtube channel so it's really support all high level games. I have done streaming also its run smoothly. But battery should get more as I have to charger daily at 2 times(heavy user!\ud83d\ude09). Its really support my work. Really a most powerful phone with A14 bionic chip, greatest chipset for 2020 to 2022 as I think because it is the winner chipset in 2021. I will highly recommend this.\n\nIt is a genuine review from me I will also update this review after 4months.That wht is the condition of my phone.",
            "It\u2019s almost a month, and I can fairly say,this IPhone 12 version is just fooling people,\nPerformance : Not satisfied as you expect from IPhone, it should be smooth. Instead it\u2019s get hanged sometimes\n- Cameras: I would say, it\u2019s equivalent to Cheapest android phone\u2019s camera. U can\u2019t zoom in.if you do pixels get spread and shows you a blur image, in normal way, the quality of pic is like a cheaper phone camera\nIt takes almost two three second to save the photo after clicking. Even changing live mode to normal, U can\u2019t click multiple photo within a second\nCamera quality so poor\nNo fingerprints option already makes it a bad one phone, Face ID also not recognised sometime and very slow few times like a cheaper phone\n\nConclusion:\nI just bought in a sell and now I realised why they were Rushing to sell, because it\u2019s really not worth buying it. Better would go with One plus.",

            "Ok here\u2019s the thing. The only thing apart from the charger that will probably make you think twice \u2018why apple, you could have at least added this\u2019 is the Apple earphones. At least a wired one. That\u2019s not much of an impact but at one moment it will for sure hit you. Otherwise it\u2019s an amazing phone. The best so far.",
            "Yes yes yes, I was planning for 1 year to purchase a good iPhone but fortunately I got this iphone 12 (128) Variant which is beyond my expectation, only 51 k with the charger. Thank you Flipkart to provide me a super opportunity to get it owned.",

I wanted to get a new phone that can be used for another 5-6 years and it could only have been an iPhone. Looking at the battery degradation over the time, 12 seemed like a better option than 12 mini.\n\nComing from a budget unit to a relatively flagship one has been a great experience.\n\nPros: Cameras, Display, Usability - gestures are way more intuitive than home button, Battery, Faster antennas w/ 5g,\n\nCons: Size/Bulk and Weight (I am coming from a 4\" phone), Glass back, Only Face-ID available which is a mess while wearing a mask, No headphone jack, No earphones/charger included",

The delivery guys are the worst. Its good that they are providing us by delivering the products but the management system is what i want to talk about.

MaH doesn\u2019t matter as long as it is effectively used my processor. And the phone super smooth for daily activities and the camera no words to describe. No heating except the regular temperature. Even human body should have 36.9 deg. And I simply loved it. Only thing is you need to buy wall adapter and headset if you don\u2019t have. But that is acceptable as Apple said. Since it is concerned with earth. As a general person this is pretty daunting but as a supporter of reducing the Corbin footprint I agree that. But Apple can do one thing they can give option for customers who bought nee apple devices can buy accessories in half the price of original accessories.

Not as flexible as android. Currently I\u2019m getting screen flickering issues too. I\u2019ve been using a vivo V5 for 5years and never for once did I get anything to complain. So getting a phone with more than twice the price ,with the apple brand on it and getting continuous issues is disheartening.",

No comparison of iPhone with any Mobile when it comes to performance & camera. Though it\u2019s 60Hz refresh rate display but far better than 60Hz android display. Display size is perfect, not to small not too tall, aspect ratio (WH) is ideal. Only caution for persons migrating from Android to iOS that Android is very user friendly so expect hiccups & give time to yourself to become familiar with iOS. Think twice before switching. If sure with this than go with iPhone 12.",

            "Got it this beast on Flipkart big billion days for 50k . And in this price range I don\u2019t think so anyone could beat him . Obviously it matters if you\u2019re thinking to switch into a world where your personal data, camera , video , and a little bit of gaming . Used for almost 3 years and it didn\u2019t lagged a single bit . Overall if you want to experience a smooth display , a awesome hepatic feedback and a processor which can handle more things than your android then you should definitely change your world to iOS. Also those who are interested in 5g this device supports many bands something around 10-12 (even more maybe) . So this is for future purpose also . On the charging part yes it heats a little beat while you are charging your phone . Don\u2019t worry that much cause it won\u2019t explode like one plus did. And the speaker quality is way more better than any device I had gone through . If you\u2019re getting it around 50-55k don\u2019t miss the deal. Will update more , thanks for reading .",

Lack of higher refresh rate display\n3. No fingerprint scanner\n\nI bought it on Big billion day for 52k. I\u2019ve been a oneplus 7 pro user and the one thing I really missed was the finger print unlock especially when we go outside with mask. Also coming from the 90hz QHD screen, I\u2019ve had to adjust in terms of display. But iOS clearly is the winner for me. The OS is so simple, smooth and clean.\nLack of customisation won\u2019t bother you much if you use your phone for applications rather than personalising.",

In a typical day you can get upto 1day of usage for sure.\n\nAlso this is my 1st transformation from android to iphone. So for sure you will get bored because you dont have that compatibility freeness to use as android.\n\nBut if your are new to iphone or switching from older to newer iphone. I highly suggest to go for it rather iphone 13. Since their is not much difference. This is my review after usage of 1month.\n\nWhy am I not mentioning about camera, performance and all is since it is an iphone. For sure you will get the best from apple products as this also gives me best. Also for 4star only because of getting bored quickly within a month. Other than that phone was super in all everything as performance, camera is my major priority.\n\nI have really really liked it, just anyone looking to buy iphone 13 or 12 pro. I highly recommend you to go for 12 only.\n\nThank you",

Love the clean screen on Android phones.\nFinding the phone lil thick but very sturdy and with good grip.\nOverall, very satisfied based on 2 weeks of usage so far.\nThanks to Flipkart for proving best festival deal (and additional Rs. 2.5k off offer from Amex), delivering it before promise date and making follow-up calls to enquire on feedback and explaining abt 1 year warranty.",

            "Good choice!!\nGot from NVIGR retails, authentic product faster delivery. Phone is good, I moved from 6s to 12 so at first, felt bulky but with time perhaps one would get used to it. Price wise it\u2019s ok for 54k. So overall it\u2019s good, yet to check the battery sustainability, though I guess it can do around 7-9 hours screen on time. Form factor is seemingly handy given the fact that bigger phones are trend, however if someone wants the slick convenience of single handed usage then 12/13 mini are better options , though there are a few caveats while choosing mini options - 1) 12 mini battery around 6 hrs screen on time , which is quite less , 2) 13 mini holds same screen on time as compared to 12 however it\u2019s price is higher side; if budget is not your concern and you want handy phone then 13 mini can be a go-to choice. 3) In case you want to spend time on bigger screens like playing games watching video, browsing, basically if entertainment is all also a part of your usage, then mini won\u2019t render you with the desired experience. With Apple, I believe, buying a year post the release of the device can save a considerable amount of money over buying on release date, hence 12 is apparently a right choice right now. Few tips while ordering and taking delivery - 1) when ordering , make sure to check Flipkart assured icon and check the seller rating 2) while taking delivery - ask the agent to open the box for you while you make a video of unboxing 3) the IMIE number on the box should match with number on the bill. 4) Apple has introduced a QR code seal tab on the packing of the phone, make sure the seal is there and intact. Post delivery , you can check the imie number in general setting of the iPhone and match it with the bill. In iPhone setting, You can also check the warranty tab and check the time stamp that is one year from the date of your iPhone purchase, this will assure the coverage of Apple company warranty. Also, you can check online, with the serial number of the device entered on apple office website can also help you check the authenticity of the product. With all these check you can assure the legitimacy of the phone.\nGiven 4 out of 5 basis my expectations from Apple; in-display finger print, a little more handy device along with a better battery would have garnered 5/5 here. Overall it\u2019s a good phone, Flipkart is genuine, NVIGR seller is authentic , product is genuine.\nHope this review helps.\nThanks",

            "I have been avid user of android before purchasing my first iPhone. Used two one plus devices before this and was in dilemma to switch to apple or not. I have iPad Air 2 which lasted me 5 years and still running great so thought of giving iPhone a try and went to iPhone 12 green 64gb model.\nFirst look was great I like the 6.1 inch which perfectly fits in my hand. Green colour is really nice and fresh. I opted for 64 gb and waited for big billion sale to get it. Got it for 43k after bank discount which is really brilliant.\nDisplay is really good. I am in dilemma to go for 11 or 12 but just for the latest led display I opted 12. Colours are bright and crisp.\nPhone is fast as of now. Didn\u2019t tried games yet.\nBattery should have been better. We have to charge it daily considering the moderate usage. Good thing is phone charges really fast compared to old models thanks to 20 w fast charging technology.\nFor android user it takes a bit time to adjust to the apple interface. But apple interface is very good fast and you will get habituate to it soon.\nThey should at least provide 90hz as this model is only 60hz which is very outdated when compared to latest android models. You will find the difference clearly when you are browsing.\nCharging adapter is not given in my box. This is really a big thing as we have to shell out 2k again for the adapter to enjoy the phones fast charging technology. But I purchased iPad Air latest version along with this mobile so I am using the iPads adapter for this which sorted my problem.\nHeadphones are not provided they should at least provide wired headphones which will be basic requirement for everyone. Shelling out again is a big thing.\nCamera is great pics taken with this are really good. Will update the pics shortly.\nOverall I can say this is best option to try an iPhone. 12 is good option now compared to 13. iPhone 13 is not that good upgrade compared to earlier iPhone models.\nGo for 128 gb if you can afford or else you can buy a pen drive which supports apple device and keep that as backup.\nHope my review helps.",

            "It\u2019s a really great phone. I\u2019m a first time iPhone User, and TBH, it\u2019s so much finer than any other Android phones I\u2019ve used. And I\u2019ve used some great flagships, like Galaxy S7, OnePlus 7T etc. You won\u2019t regret buying it for sure.\nFor an Android Power User, you might feel Battery Life is a little low, and from my experience, if u r out of the house for a day, using LTE, GPS, full screen brightness the whole time, you\u2019ll probably need to charge the phone by evening.\nBut, using the phone 60-70% of the time indoors, I am getting 6.5-7hrs SOT easily every day. I usually charge every 24hrs.\n\u201cPS- I\u2019m not a hardcore gamer. I play games casually, maybe 30-40mins a day. So that is the battery life for me.\u201d",

The notifications, the dialer, the messenger even the lock screen will irritate you like hell. The notification bar and control pannel are two different things here so you have to slide it from different different ends.

Display: first time ever apple gave same Display on non pro Iphone, Display is same as 12 pro, OLED panel. Super smooth\n\n3. Very much handy unlike 11 pro, they gave us 6\u20191 inches screen this time, which fits perfectly in hand and doesn\u2019t look too small or too big.\n\n4. Value for money, if you\u2019re getting 128gb under 60k then believe me it\u2019s worth it.

            "A decent phone with a dull display. Had a lot of expectations before purchasing the phone, was using XR till date. The iPhone 12 display was absolutely gorgeous when I last saw it on the Apple store. But feel a bit disappointed after flipkart online purchase. This has never happened earlier with my earlier purchases online. Lesson learnt do not purchase high valued products online. I guess these phones meant for sale come from manufacturing vendors with inferior internals. Apple online support is just as rubbish as it can get. 1 hour on call to log the case with apple support and still the support executive trying to convince me that yellow tint on display is common. On top of that the Apple service Center B2X Chennai informed that there is 2 displays from Apple one is yellow and other is blue but when I asked if his statement can be supported with a Apple support link. There was no answer. Did not return as I purchased it on a best deal. I know flipkart wouldn\u2019t have accepted the return and I did not want to go through the hassle of calls and emails with the . Possibly Will go for a exchange on store next year with 14. Something not right with the display compared to the store ones. It looks yellowish and a bit dull. Rest all is ok.",

Well, the device is typically apple.. well built, smooth experience etc. However I personally didn\u2019t find it to be an upgrade from my iPhone X really. People who are upgrading from X or Xs will know what I mean. The screen has a warmer hue, I was told this warmer tone is more accurate than the cooler one on previous models. The in hand feel according to me is far more premium on the iPhone X but it might be due to it\u2019s steel chassis against that of the iPhone 12 which is aluminium. And I found some pre-defined sounds like the lock sound, bedtime reminder, message tone to be considerably lower than that of the iPhone X. Naturally worried, I visited the nearest service centre and I was told not to compare the new phones to the old ones like X, Xs, Xs max etc.. lol. Otherwise the 12 is really good, fast, and more efficient with the A14 chip. Hope this helps.",

You will absolutely fall in love with it, I damn guarantee you.\n2. Camera is superb. Even in low light it woks awesome.\n3. The face unlock interface is very fast.\n4. Performance is smooth, no lags no freezing.\n5. Battery is very good for me as I don\u2019t play much high end games except some. It gets me for at least 12-14 hours which is fair.\n\nCons:\n1. As I just switched so I face some difficulties while switching apps or pressing back button, it will overcome by use.\n2. Everything is paid, so you have to spend some extra bucks or better subscribe to ota apps.\n3. No adapter to charge, had to buy 20W separately.\n4. The eSIM is not as good as it says. Some apps don\u2019t run unless they detect sim, mostly bank apps.\n5. Image format is HEIF/HEVC. If you are switching to JPEG, you will lose the 4K 60 fps feature.",

It\u2019s definitely worth an upgrade if you\u2019re coming from any phone below iPhone 10. Not so much difference from 11 though, except for design. You\u2019ll see performance difference only if you put both the phones side by side and compare otherwise you won\u2019t notice in daily ordinary tasks.\n\nIt\u2019s sad that apple chose to remove charger in the name of environmental protection. I could do without an earphone for once but a charger is a necessity.",

But u can save your battery percentage and health for leng term purpose by doing changes in settings or putting it in a low power mode. But it is not that bad though it doesn\u2019t give battery backup as android fons which are having 5000mah or above. You dont have to worry about it much. Performance wise its super. Very smooth. I got it for 56k. Iam happy with this. Camera is superb btw. Go for it if you are a normal to medium user and mainly focused on camera features",

            "Not a big upgrade in camera bt as per price it\u2019s worth\nAmazing battery life\nAwesome performance no doubt\nOnly you have to buy charger separately \ud83d\ude1c",
            "The phone is a true value for money product\u2026and I\u2019m writing this review after 1 week of use\u2026there are some important things to be mentioned\n1. The premium feel is the most important thing one can deserve\u2026this phone is the best one to have that feeling.\n2. The most satisfactory thing is the battery performance\u2026you can use the phone whole day after having full charge in the morning. Battery draining is very less unless you\u2019re doing some heavy work.\n3. Now talking about the camera experience\u2026the camera is a bit low graded in comparison with android\u2026in this price point android provides you a better camera quality and many editing options\u2026but iPhone is more concentrated about sharpness of the image\u2026the pic you click is the sharpest one but not very detailed one like android\u2026still it\u2019s a 12+12MP camera.\n4. The OLED Display is super smooth and you will fall in love with it\u2019s smoothness\u2026a bit orgasmic\ud83d\ude1c.\n5. The backup platform i.e. iCloud is not very satisfactory\u2026it provides only 5GB of backup capacity in built\u2026you have to pay a good amount per month to increase it to 50GB\u2026that\u2019s not what you expect from this phone.\n6. One problem that I faced recently just for one time that is when I tried to click a picture of some tasty momos\u2026suddenly the camera application hanged and my phone just switched off automatically\u2026after turning on it behaves normally\u2026I\u2019m still confused what happened then\u2026may be a bug that I have to fix,god knows.\n7. You will get all your necessary applications for free from App Store.\n8. Most importantly, buy this phone only from a reputed retailer and check the ratings of that particular retailer\u2026if it\u2019s above 4.5\u2b50\ufe0f..then only buy from that retailer\u2026otherwise you may get an iFone instead of an iPhone\ud83d\ude1d\n\nSo, according to me the phone is almost perfect for those who want performance for their work purpose\u2026but if you\u2019re a gamer and thinking of buying an iPhone 12, don\u2019t buy it\u2026it\u2019s not for gaming\u2026yeah you can run BGMI or PUBG or CODM peacefully but try avoiding games\nSo signing off by telling you last few words\u2026don\u2019t hesitate\u2026just remember those above mentioned points and purchase it\u2026afterall it\u2019s an iPhone 12.\ud83d\ude0c",

Everything thing is made to waste your time and irritate you as a user.\nI am a gamer and even though gaming performance of the phone is good, the experience is really bad. No headphone jack, small screen make it uncomfortable for gaming. No charger provided, I thought I will manage with other phone chargers but these rascals provide type C to lightning cable in the box and not the USB A to lightning. So I purchased the apple 20w adapter for Rs 1800, for headphones I purchased the lightning to 3.5mm adapter for rs. 900\nUI is pathetic. Even unlocking involves two steps. First tap to wake screen or press side power button then swipe from the bottom of the screen after face id\nunlocks it. Face id is such a hassle with masks. Every time you have to lower your mask or enter password to login. Keep lowering your mask to unlock while traveling in metro or in public places.\nWhats the point in paying such high amount of money and still facing difficulties, even in the most basic functionalities like unlocking your phone.",

It captures more light than i can see in real life in dark scenes. Lol.\nA different UI. Still getting used to it. Very smooth but still missing that back button.\nBought it for 55k at sale and I feel this is definitely worth it.\nThe package arrived well.
