Couldn\u2019t stop it anyways other than switching off the phone. Flipkart has no guarantee for phones after 7 days and so I had to contact Nokia. They only send some automated emails saying they have created a ticket for this issue, but when again contacting them to follow up they\u2019ll create another ticket so going back to square one each time we contact them. One guy told they\u2019ll arrange pickup for this item from my house and will then send a replacement. But the next time we follow up with them, they will again create a ticket for the issue. So I have used this phone only 2 weeks and then it\u2019s gone. Still waiting to get a response from Nokia or Flipkart. Very disappointed!",
