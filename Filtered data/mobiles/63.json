            "First of all I really thanks to flipkart & my favourite brand infinix Indian brand now I will say few words about infinix note 11s I used for ten days with roughly I did not get any issue with this mobile so I can say heartily & honestly it is one of the good, awesome, marvellous & fantastic mobile for the year of 2022 so dear flipkart customers I am giving rating so that you can resolve by yourself 1.camera front & back 4/5, Gaming 5/5, Display 5/5, performance 5/5, battery 5/5, Display br...\nREAD MORE",
            "Good choice for this price\n\nI am reviewing this phone after using more than one month. Dispite being around 7 inch size, it doent feel bulky in hand. Its handiness is very good and has very decent looks. One more thing I like about this phone is the battery backup. This 5000mh phone gives more backup than my previous 6000mh samsung galaxy M30s phone. The UI experience is quite rich. Performance is also good never lagged on any day to day tasks. Charging of this phone is super fast. Biometric scans are fast enough. I haven't used camera much, so can't say much about it.\n\nNow the cons part. This phone doesn't come with widewine L1 certification, so Netflix 1080p level vedios are not supperted. Secondary noise cancellation on mic is not provided. And lastly, one particular thing i didn't like about this phone is when calling in handsfree/speeker mode, the audio quality deteriorates. This is a very basic feature and much cheaper phones of every other company provide good audio quality qhile speaking in handsfree mode. Infinix should look into it.",
            "Awesome phone at affordable prize really pleased with the product and team Flipkart thank you guys",
            "When Comparing with infinix note 11 only good point is\n1) screen is cool tinted and colour accuracy is good, like any other good lcd, which makes reading on screen pleasing, note 11 suffers from tint issue, so white looks cool to warm.\n1.2)And colours are natural, good for some , may not please some.\n1.3) reading documents is better compared with amoled.\n2) speed is great, no lag at all.\n3) had wide wine L1.\n\nBad points\n1) heavy, difficult to use with one hand.\nAnd lowest brightness is not low enough, so at nights if you r using phone, it hurts eyes.\nHere also note 11 excels, with lowest brightness setting keeps brightness very low.\n2) sound output is lower and not as pleasing as note 11\n3) Amoled excels in movie watching and probably in games too, due to extraordinary contrast ratio, which lcd lacks, that said on its own it is ok, but can't match with amoled.\n4) big , difficult to use with one hand, but weight is balanced well.\n5) not as classy looking as note 11\n6) camera has over exposure problem, and suffers heavily from exposure problems, brightness is changed all most every second in video, basically software is bad, and we cannot use third party camera apps to correct that.\n\nVerdict: if you don't bother tint issue of amoled and widevine L1, note 11 is much better than this, for normal users, may be gamers might feel it underpowered, but regular users would be delighted with note 11 compared with 11s, particularly at the present price of 10.5k and who r normal users like me(i mean non gamers).\n\nBuilt of both phones is great, main reason why I bought them.",
