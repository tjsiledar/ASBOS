Battery drains out faster than M2 reloaded. 4g network bandwidth are very weak. Compromise on speaker is a big load. Worst thing is ,it doesn't have a wide angle camera. I dont understand why! In the package, they should add one ear phone. That's missing. Refresh rate is a bit slow. I guess, after a load od datas, it will hang a lot. But let's see.\n\nGood parts are, Looks - A1. Touch and Feel - A1. Camera - Showing problems after few days of use. Display - Buttery Smooth. Brightness - Works fine for me. Size - A little Bigger than usual phones.\n\nOverally, its not value for money. Go for a better range 5G phone.",
