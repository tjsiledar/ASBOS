            "It's the best phone i get in 2021\nMy experience was like whole new level like literally\n120Hz display in very reasonable price and Helio G96 processor the performance which I got was amazing\nI tried playing high GPU games like BGMI , Free Fire there was not even a single lag in high settings\n\nThe camera was okay but it can be better i think the settings in the software was not optimised i think this problem may also be fixed from the updates\n\nAnd The Updated XOS version 10.0.0 i like so much with new customisation but it's not fully optimised for the battery\nI faced a little bit problem from battery as it uses more resources even being 5000mAh it's giving In-Display time upto 5~6 hrs which i don't like\n\n\nThe OS still need to be optimised\n\n\nAnd the most i like form this phone is it's 6.95 inch Display wow it's so big and it's changes the exp in the game\n\nBut one problem it has Wide 1 L3 certificate with means u cannot enjoy the full HD experience in ott platform u can watch upto 540p clearly sadly",

It's great experience",

I THOUGH BIGGER DISPLAY IS BIGGER FUN but it proved me wrong. It's quite uncomfortable actually.\n2. Cannot perform Heavy duty (Crashes and apps stops working, keeps disconnecting from wifi automatically and other devices doesn't do that\n3. Because graphics is not that good. Compared to Realme 8 and redmi note 8 pro, those phone never hanged while doing something. And I have not even used 3gb ram out of 8.\n\nI would say don't go for it, it's not better than Realme and Redmi",

            "Infinix Note 11 s Free Fire Edition phone is great. Go for it. More than 5 stars from me. Screen size, battery performance, camera, ram, storage capacity all perfect in this price range. In a month I hv bought 2 Infinix brand phones 1. Infinix Note 10 Pro and 2. Infinix Note 11 s free fire edition for my daughter. We both are super happy. These phone is up to the mark for all my phone requirements. 5\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f",
