You have nailed it.\n\nInitial experience -\nI was pleasantly surprised with the quick delivery of the phone.\nOn opening the package, I was even more surprised pleasantly, as not only the phone but it's battery and charger are also made in India.\nThe phone has a removable battery.\nThe phone has a nice blue colour.\nThe phone is easy to set up. Performance of the phone is decent as it did not lag (normal usage with social media etc.). Full charging takes slightly over 2 hours and then it easily lasts for 2 days with normal usage. A screen guard was also given along with the phone.\n\nTo summarise the positives and not so positives of the phone -\nPositives - Made in India; Good performance; Huge battery; 2 sim slots + 1 data card slot; Value for money.\nNegatives - None found till now.",
