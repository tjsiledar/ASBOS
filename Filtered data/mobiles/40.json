            "Review After Using 5 Days:\n\n1. SD 750 works very well and give a very good performance\n2. Fingerprint Sensor is very quick and responsive\n3. Camera is not up to the mark. Many other devices in the same range perform very well comparatively.\n4. Charing adapter not provided in the box. Gives a bad impression. Although the device supports 25W. See below the charging speed analysis.\n5. Samsung Keyboard's haptic feedback is awesome. I have not tried any other keyboard.\n6. Knox security present\n7. Display is decent. But the 120Hz refresh rate lags sometimes. Sometimes it's buttery smooth, sometimes it's not.\n8. One UI 4.1 and Android 12 out of the box, which is impressive.\n9. Battery backup is decent enough for entire day usage.\n10. RAM management is decent so far.\n11. Sound quality is pretty decent. Better than many competitions.\n12. Bloatwares are present but most of them can be uninstalled.\n13. No back cover and tamper glass was provided in the box.\n14. True 5G experience with 12 bands.\n15. Has a dedicated memory card slot along with two sims.\n16. Call recording without announcement is present.\n\n\nCharging Speed Analysis:\n1. Samsung 15W charger - Took around 2 hours 30 minutes to full charge from zero.\n2. Vooc 18W charger - Took around 2 hours 30 minutes to full charge from zero.\n3. Dart 33W charger - Took around 2 hours 10 minutes to full charge from zero.\n4. Samsung 25W charger - Took surprisingly around 1 hour 30 minutes to full charge from zero.",
            "In love with this phone. \ud83d\ude0d\n\nMy first Samsung phone and it's really worth it.\nBgmi Cod Asphalt all are running smoothly on this device.\nMade a great choice thanks flipkart.",
            "Everything is good except the charging adaptor and camera quality. Specially the camera is not upto mark. Camera quality is just okay neither too bad nor too good 2.7/5 stars.\nAlso note that as this model is very new. So back cover is not available in market easily.\nF23 photos are not sharp and crisp. Poco was better. I had bought the phone and camera is not good. Xiaomi and poco vivo are offering better camera. You have to make a choice between processor vs camera. If you want camera then don't buy this phone but if you are a gamer then processor is good.",
            "After 2 days of use i am giving this review\n\nCamera is good but not very good.\nDisplay is awesome, couldn't expect that a TFT display can give a awesome experience of video and graphics. And touch is extremely smooth, it is actual 120hz refresh rate.\nBattery backup is good.\nThough it has mono speaker but sound is clear and loud.\nAnd processor is First enought to play BGMI in HD and High frame rate.\nCan play 4k video smoothly.\nThe only issue is no adaptor inside, but charging cable is there we need to buy a adaptor by our own.\n\nOverall performance is good in this budget. I am happy",
            "First of all, this is a Samsung 2022 5G phone.\nPros:\n1. Android 12 with Oneui 4.1 out of the box is extremely good os, feels like a flagship.\n2. Call recording without announcement.\n3. 5G ready with 12 5G bands\n4. Rear camera is very good. Ultra wide cam is also usable.\n5. Processor SD 750G is extremely fluid and doesn't throttle or heat up even in summer.\n6. Battery 5000mah is just awesome. I charge with Portronics 18W charger which takes less than 2 hr to charge.\n7. Display is TFT LCD but believe me, this is very much equivalent to any good IPS screens out there. Very high quality TFT screen used here.\n8. 2 year OS update and 4 year security update is good for future.\n9. Career aggregation works good. NFC is present.\n10. Full fledged Samsung pay is available along with Knox.\n\nCons:\n1. Charger and Back case not included in box.",
            "A good phone in the budget of 15k- 20k with a better processor compared to other phones in this range. Also, refresh rate is higher than other phones in this range. Weaker points are the TFT Display, Front Camera and Drop Notch. Forest Green colour is near to Black colour not making it to look odd but decent.\n\nOverall satisfied with the phone in this price range.\n\nDelivery was on time and the packaging was quiet good.",

Audio quality via headphones is crisp and balanced. Battery lasts easily for 24 hrs, on medium usage. It is a fast phone, and handles normal tasks effortlessly. 2 years android update, which hopefully samsung will deliver. Overall, I think it is a good phone, which can be a good daily driver.",

Processing power is strong and I haven't experienced any lags yet. Tried Asphalt; amazing graphics. It actually has a 3.5mm audio jack, which many websites have got wrong. Charger is missing, but it's just another grand. Charging is super fast, and battery life is more than you'd expect from phones in this range.",
            "Just the best product for my dreams. 5g, Dual sim, hours of browsing, fantastic camera, extended memory support, good network capturing, high speed, zero hanging!!\nWhat else one could imagine for this money.. made for India i may say.",
            "Nice phone ,nice design,medium quality,normal screen,in this price performance was best , overall good Samsung phone , happily buy this phone",
            "Overall a good and nice phone , for whom who are looking for a budget phone , performance , battery , camera are very good , value for money",
            "After using this phone for more than a week i can say that it is a good phone for day to day use.\nI personally do not game on my phone so not sure on the gaming performance.\nThe camera quality is okiesh not the best but never the less it's good.\nCharging time is fast provided you are using 25w charger.\nFor the price it's a good phone with knox security and with 2 yrs of Android OS updates and 4 yrs of security updates.\n\nNote: Initially the phone did heat a bit but after updating the software updates from samsung the issue seems to be fixed.",
            "Flipkart delivery is fulfilled as per 2 days commitment.\n\nAfter 3days usage the phone meets my expectations\n\nPros: Good processor with 12 5G band support and 120 Hz refresh rate\n\nThose who are giving complaint better read the specification before buying",
            "bro awesome product . buy it if having a budget <20000. TFT display not an issue. cameras top notch. little bit big screen. processor best. notch is outdated. best design.",
            "This device provides premium user interface and refresh rate is kinda mesmerizing while there is a missing of amoled display. Battery is literally weak and drains quickly eventhough it is in its early stage. I don't know how battery will perform after a couple of months.\nSamsung met its audience's expectation of camera without any doubt and I am in love with it. Its camera is way better than that of poco, realme and redmi. Finger print sensor also works pretty well but proximity sensor is not working properly (Hate you Samsung).\nThe major drawback is no charger, back cover and tempored glass. Back is covered with plastic and back cover is really necessary. Also it lags a little even if it is used less.\nIn conclusion, purchase this device if you want samsung's brand, good camera and android updation otherwise go for poco.",
            "Device is Real Great for it's price.\nMany people have criticized it's display because it's old TFT technology but display is quite good and on par with most of IPS displays.\nMain USP of this phone is it's software. Other brands provide a bit better specs at the same price but they lack on UI and software updates. Samsung is better in this case with regular updates.\nSamsung pay is really useful and way more faster and convenient to use than any other payment app.\nSamsung knox security is huge bonus at this price point.\nSamsung one UI works ok. But one ui 4.1 on android 12 is still a bit glitchy. There are some issues which Samsung must address. Sometimes phone hangs while unlocking with fingerprint and takes 5-6 seconds to unlock. Also phone randomly restarts while it's locked.\nOverall a great 5g phone at the price point.",

The headphone jack should be in top.\n- The area where the back cameras are mounted, is little outside in compare to back body, which can cause scratches on the camera while placing this smartphone on the rough surface.\n- Volume key and power key is on the same side which creates confusion.\n- Front camera is very bad. Before clicking the picture, it shows better quality on the screen, but after capturing, it shows in bad quality.\n- Speaker is in the bottom side, which gets cover sometimes by hand while holding it, which creates trouble.\n\nAbove drawbacks are only in the design, feature wise and quality wise, this smartphone is good.",
