            "After using 1 month there is no issue\n1.Performance is next level\n2.Camera is the best at that price\n3.Display is super smooth\n4.Battery is 5000mah with 33 watt charger is a good feature\nI\"ll recommend all the people to buy the phone",
            "Nice phone. Worth every penny. Very fast and smooth. Nice display.\nIt is fully loaded for a budget smart phone. Anything you can do with a premium smartphone is possible with this phone.",
            "Best phone in these segment considering price & so much durability & strong so it is worth purchase. The combination of 8+256 GB is rare at this price segment with Full HD display of 6.95\" & with hidden flash for front camera is a surprise for person who clicks it.",
            "Awesome phone\nPerformance is next level , I have not faced any lag when doing multitasking , 8GB ram is great advantage.\nIt's processor is very much optimised so we can play heavy graphics games smoothly\nAnd 256 internal memory is enough to store a lot of things, I think almost all other phones in this price range has only 128 gb memory\nCamera is also worth for that price.\nBattery backup is great ..for normal usage it can go up to 3 days and that is more than I expected.\n\nOne thing I have noticed is when we watch hd contents it's colour production is not that much good . expect this I am very much satisfied by this purchase.",
            "After going through various reviews i ordered this phone by prepaid. Received the mobile from Flipkart on 2nd July 21. Thanks for one day in advance delivery. This is my first infinix mobile.This is my 3rd day usage only. At the outset this mobile looks somewhat premium though plastic built-up. Somany inbuilt useful features. Thanks to Infinix. Regarding display it is big like tablet but due to its height easy to hold and use. But display brightness is low even in indoor when compared to redmi, mi, realme, samsung, techno mobiles which I have used and using now. For comfortable sharp viewing brightness should be put in full. I feel in daylight display visibility is almost not up to mark. I hope infinix will definitely improve screen brightness by immediate software updates. Cameras back and front are ok for normal photography. If it is improved by software updates then this note 10 pro is one of the best in this segment. Regarding ram management it requires lot of improvements. Though it is 8 gb ram, around 3 gb only available almost all the time. 256 GB storage is the highlight. So definitely there will be no chance for storage shortage. Even if we want more space then we can use dedicated sd card. Screen refresh rate also good so far. Fingerprint, face unlock are fast enough. Next i feel battery management should improve. I am not a heavy user. But battery is draining very fast. Within 5 hours of normal usage 50 percent of battery drained. For the past 3 days i am charging this phone twice a day. Speakers are sounding well and audible. This is also good part of this mobile. In general frequent software updates are essential for any kind or brand mobiles. Infinix should also provide software updates then and there. Out of the box this mobile i am having now updated till March 2021 only. I hope that infinix will definitely sort out (1) battery draining, (2)screen brightness, (3)cameras performance, (4)better ram management atleast up to 6 gb out of 8 gb ram etc.issues by OTA updates. This review is strictly on my personal opinion and usage of my infinix note 10 pro. Thanks.",
            "I am writing this review after two week amazing phone great battery and fast charging.the camere is just woww.... Display is very good .the design is highly appreciated. Over all it is worth to the money",
            "I am posting this review after 3 weeks of usage.\n\nOne of the best and unique smartphone you will have with tons of features which makes an amazing experience having it.\n\nExcellent Camera, Huge Big Display & Refresh Rate with amazing Design and Vast storage. What else we need in this segment.\n\nWe don't daily use Camera or store couple of things. Selfie & Rear Cameras are perfect as well. The company no-where discussed about the camera sensor. Selfie camera provides amazing selfies, I have bunch of moles on my face, and this camera shows them crystal clear. Haven't seen any camera providing such details with the other brands.\n\nBut Gaming, Streaming and Multimedia are indeed the daily tasks for almost everybody. Other than this, the most amazing thing I eargerly wanted to have an infinix mobile was - features. It has the premium features which could only be seen in high class/ bigger brand mobiles.

            "Awesome phone in this price range. Best feature is its Ram, Rom, Camera, Battery & 33w Charger.\n\nGifted to my daughter. The happiness and the smile on her face after seeing this phone was more worthy to me than the price of this phone.\n\nOnly Pros are there, no cons from my end as it brought happiness & smile on my Princess face. Thanx Flipkart for delivering on time and Thanx to Infinix for such a budget friendly great product.\n\nWaiting for new amazing gadgets in coming days from Infinix.",

            "I have been using a Super Amoled Screen phone since 4.5 years. Initially it was confusing whether to buy a phone with IPS LCD or not. But the screen of this phone does not feel like an IPS one. The design of the phone is top notch. The sound quality is crystal clear.\nThe face unlock feature is very responsive. It unlocks the phone even if you are wearing a mask.\nI would strongly recommend people to buy this phone if you are looking for a mid range smartphone.",

I trust you Flipkart, thanks to you too......",
            "I have used this phone for almost two months now. The pros and cons of this phone are as under:\nPros\n1. Battery life: It lasts for an entire day. It takes just 90 minutes to charge to full battery. I used to carry my charger to work everyday, and now I don't.\n\n2. Camera in day light: Camera in day light is very detailed, and captures high quality images.\n\n3. Processor: Even though it is a 4G device, the processor is very efficient and fast. Doesn't lag at all and it great for users like me who don't play heavy games much.\n\n4. Storage and RAM: The cheapest phone with 256gb storage and 8gb RAM. It really makes a difference in the performance of the phone and it is a great thing to have.\n\n5. Volume: The volume on the phone is adequate. You can hear it loud and clear.\n\n6. Connectivity: No 5G here. However, the voice quality for calls was fine.\n\n7. Other random premium features: You can use flash while on videocall and many others. They are great.\n\nCons\n\n1. Display: It is indeed too dark. You won't enjoy movies on it much, especially movies with dark lighting. You won't be able to see the details at all. In fact its darkness is the reason I am giving it 3 stars. It cannot be improved by any software update also.\n\n2. Camera at night: It is just ok. Nothing special. Images can be blurry.\n\n3. Weight: It is a large phone and you will most certainly feel it in your pocket at all times. It's screen is huge too.",

            "Thought of terrible experience awaiting for me as My brand new Infinix Note 10 Pro went all black within 20 hours of receiving it (Display was blinking, No control over touch screen such as Apps juggles between, Install's self, Cam clicks pix's with Flash itself, etc.) before going for complete blackout.. I Felt like watching some Video Game.. LOL..\n\nFinally, Checked in for Flipkart Support for Replacement though had initial apprehension's but within little over 2 Days (27 Hours), I got my replacement which works perfectly as of I'm reviewing the product. Online Support, Technical guys visit, replacement... All happened in two days time.\n\nProduct: For this price, it meets all my expectations so far and may be the battery stays little over a day that could have been better. Speed, CAM, performance, Audio, etc are definitely good for the price.\n\nThanks to the Flipkart & Infinix Teams for the hassle-free replacement process.",

It's a bit confusing why Infinix using plastic in modern time when almost all brands using glass back panel. And moving files within drive takes time like moving files in external storage. I think this software issue hope they'll fix in next updates. And internal storage has UFS 2.1 I think not UFS 3.1 like modern mobiles. May be this is the reason for files copy and move take long time. Overall good like display and regress rate.",
