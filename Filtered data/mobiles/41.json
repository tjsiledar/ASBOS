            "Great Value For Money phone.\nI have 2 Mi flagships launched this year as my daily driver. But could not resist buying this for the price. Moto did not disappoint.\nThe camera in daylight produces bright images ready for social media. You can reduce the warm tone in post if you like a cooler vibe. Even the wide angle is very good and produces better images than all 8mp snappers till 30K. Definitely better than my Mi 11x which I use as a secondary phone. I used latest gCam mod and found the moto stock cam to be better in 70 percent scenario.\nDisplay is good enough for the price. There is no stutters in UI as the processor is good enough. Moto even gives 1gb expansion for 4gb ram.\nBattery easily lasts a day with heavy use. Moto guestures are very convenient. The UI is clean and no boloatware, so very light on the resource.\nPeople complaining about low internal space is true. However, I think, thinkshield security and Moto softwares (which are very good once you use it) takes up that space. In my opinion hybrid sim slot could be a deal breaker for some. Atleast I wished there could be a dedicated card slot. There is also no option for you to use external memory card as internal. So you can't move your apps. Although, you can move your images and videos etc.\nVerdict: Go for it. It is definitely better than 4g phones like G40 and other 5g phones available in its price range",
            "Excellent camera with different pixel density modes, clean OS with useful UI and gesture customisations, solid build quality, long lasting battery, nice back cover, does not feel heavy due to good weight distribution, has good in hand feel, 20W charger supports fast charging.",

Future proof 5g with 12 band support so you don't have to worry when 5g will come to india, its a long road but its a good thing to be future proof.\n2.

            "Review after 1 week of use :\n\nPros:\n*Build quality is absolutely one of the best in this category (after using multiple smartphones of other brands)\n*Looks much attractive & eye-soothing in reality, compared to that in pictures\n*Camera quality is really great. Moto didn't comprise a single bit in quality. Portrait mode is mostly perfect & well composite with its AI processing. Colours stands out really attractive. Details are very well preserved even in ultra wide lens. Primary lens is wide, which makes it really useful in tight areas framing. Front camera is very well sorted and detailed.\n*Moto phones have really nice displays. With 120Hz , the display is the BEST YOU CAN GET IN THIS PRICE SEGMENT. Trust me I mean it (even compared to phones with budget amoled displays). Moto IS THE ONLY BRAND WHO ALWAYS DID & STILL PROVIDES glance display for quickly checking out time, notification even in LCD display.\n*The stock android experience is the smoothest compared to all bloatware loaded UIs for other brands.\n*Being the biggest phone (6.8\" display + 5000mah battery), still weighs significantly average.\n*With Dolby Atmos sound is great with earphones plugged in.\n\nCons:\n#No memory expansion & no more storage options models\n#Display maximum brightness is a little less in bright sunlight. Could have been a bit more.\n#Fast charging >20 watt should have been a feature.",
            "Pros :\n1. Daylight camera is good. Front camera is also good. Also You can install G Cam in moto Phones, I request all of you to install G Cam on this phone.\n2. UI is good and no major lags.\n3. Performance is surprisingly good. BGMI( Smooth + ultra with gyroscope runs without lags.)\n4. Display 120hz refresh rate handles good.\n5. Battery is good with auto refresh rate.\n\nCons :\n1. No option to change video resolution ( even can't see in which resolution I am shooting the video ).\n2. Very bad camera UI. It's sometime lags.\n3. Hybrid slot with 64 Gb storage is very less for storing apps also there is no option to transfer app data to SD card like One UI.\n4. Display Quality is average.",
            "Nice phone. Good performance.. It does it's duty under 15k specifications. Camera quality is acceptable. Height is little bit long.. 33w charger is best for this phone for fast charging.. Battery backup is good..Otherwise this phone is amazing. Worth for 15k.",
