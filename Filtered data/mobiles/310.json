            "Let\u2019s keep it simple,\nPhone is damn smooth and if you are coming from Android, you will really notice the difference no matter which smartphone you used earlier.\nPros:\n1. Camera and image processing (portrait modes)\n2. Battery (7hrs screen on time) i.e. all day battery life\n3. iOS (If you are coming from Android, you will need 2 days to get used to it.. like gestures and all but once you are into it, there's no way turning back. Animations are refined and you will enjoy them)\n4. Face ID is super fast and 100% secure\n5. Performance is superior to most Android smartphone in market as of today in this price bracket. A12 it is !!\n6. Speakers are excellent\n7. Haptic feedback is next level. I can't explain in words.. in short it feels like someone is sitting inside and knocking phone's display \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nCons:\n1. Glass back costs half price of phone itself if in case you end up shattering it\n2. Phone is heavy.. 194 grams to be precise and when you add screen guard and back cover, it will add up and finally be around 210~230 grams\n3. Battery charging is slow. Like what else will you expect from a 5w charger.\n4. Front camera res is 7MP and will give you consistent results for 95% of time but for rest.. be prepared for some horrible selfies \ud83d\ude02\n\nSee, if you think that you are ok with a camera performance of 4/5, then blindly go with this phone. And if you are one who has camera as #1 priority then you must go for iPhone 11, it has better cameras.\n\nPro Tip: Don\u2019t judge it\u2019s display and camera based on just on paper specs and numbers. Both are excellent and 99% people won\u2019t have any problem.\nOne more thing.. if possible go with a 128 gigs variant. iPhones eat lot of space !!",

            "I received my phone packaged properly and there were no issues with delivery.\nNow coming to the phone, I would like to rate it 4 stars.\n\nCamera - Decent camera but there are much better camera out there for the price. This camera is good for 2018 phone but outdated for 2021 phone. If you like to click macro shots of flowers, insects then it might be better to look elsewhere. Landscape and portrait photos are excellent.\n\nBattery - Great battery backup and would easily last a day for an average user or may be a little more. I use 10w ipad charger and it charges the phone to 80% in about 30-35 mins. Phone heats up while fast charging but that\u2019s how it is with most phones\n\nDisplay - Its LCD, should have been OLED at this price but hey, its not bad by any standards. The touch is something cannot be \u201ccopied\u201d by the Chinese phones, its smooth, haptic feedback is great.\n\nSpeaker - Good speaker, its loud but bass could have been better. You need high quality audio to play it at full volume otherwise it may produce static. Overall it is satisfactory.\n\nHardware - A12 chip with 3GB ram works flawlessly even in 2021, there is no lag of any sort while multitasking or using heavy apps although the phone heats a little but nothing alarming. You can play any game of your choice provided you have enough juice in battery.\n\nShould you buy it? Yes, if your priority is brand, build quality, IOS, business usage and you are careful with your gadgets(dropping it might cost you a bomb) then this phone will easily outlast any other android phone in the price range.\n\nAnd No if your priority is Camera, customisations, very heavy usage, hardcore gamer because there are better phones available with new gen hardware out there.",
            "It\u2019s a perfect compact phone Great performance a12bionic chip camera quality is very good at daylight but poor quality in low light. Display is quite good no issues. And at the end of the day it\u2019s IPhone. So you should go for it. And yes privacy is extremely superb Thanks that\u2019s all it\u2019s my opinion.",
            "Best ever from Iphone\n\nthis is my first apple device and i\u2019m very glad that i bought this instead of OnePlues 7pro\nThe phone has awesome battery backup, sound quality,style , and camera",
            "I have bought the 128GB Product RED version.\nBeing an Android user, it was a different hands-on experience of the XR and Iam really liking it.\nDisplay looks great, sound quality is great, camera quality is good and mainly the gaming performance is so smooth and fast and never felt a single frame drop ever.\n\nEven though its costly for an \"Budget\" apple iphone, it's worth the money I have spent on this mobile.",
            "Great value for money iphone. All rounder. Still a champ to give a stiff n best fights to many same range flagships.\nNeed an iPhone. Go for it. Good hardware, better with the camera, battery life is can be managed with a day average plus usage. Rest this is not a beast but surly neither a general 1..it got all that you need in a good 1..so in 2021 if this is ur last stretched budget, then blindly choose this as yours.",
            "Once again , very very happy with the product. 100% genuine and timely delivery. Thanks a lot flipkart. Happy to shop from here. Highly recommend everyone to go for this product. Worth buying.",
            "Frankly speaking I was hesitating to place order online for such huge amount phone but the exchange facility, committed delivery time and the packaging is absolutely fine. Thanks to Flipkart.\nTalking about the phone - I switched to iOS for the first time. I am One plus lover but I didn\u2019t want to pay to Chinese product hence got this amazing made in California and assembled in India product. Smooth touch, ease of handling and good battery life is giving nice experience. Value for money!",
            "Awesome phone. Its my 2nd iPhone XR. Still best in 2020.\nMuch better than iPhone 11. Thanks flipkart for this special offer. Many Many thanks to Apple for make this beautiful device. Its far better than Android",
            "After using android for 10 yrs m, i moved to iOS and i must say its very difficult to find n use iPhone...i will come to this later , let me start with features: nice camera but not better than samsung note 8.. display bright n good .. nice sound and very good look... a bit bulky...\n\nWhat irritates me :\n\n1. Setting ur fav song as ringtone: torture to do that...\n2. 90% of good app either wallpaper or ringtones or utility: are paid..\n3 iCloud only 5gb..\n4. Not able to migrate chrome bookmarks here so far\n5. Not sure why select all doesnt work either on msg or whastapp or anywhere\n6. Default charger takes arnd 4 hrs to full charge\n7. Sound is good n default headset gives good sound\n\nStruggle everywhere for android users...\n\nLast but not least, love to have an iPhone .\n\nThanks",

            "I have been using it from last 4 months and are fully satisfied with it. I had purchased it from flipkart and everyone knows that its price is much higher compare to the android phone having almost same features. But everything on an iPhone is premium . Looks great in Corel colour, battery last for full one day. Camera is awesome. Although display is not LED but still it looks great. Sound quality is great. No fast charger in the box may be a con. No heating issue at all,high end games works smoothly.",

The camera of this phone is just awsome, sound quality is very good(thanks to the stereo speakers) & performance is too good A12 bionic is dazzling fast. Only disadvantage's are, no portrait mode for object's & the bazels are thicker than it's bigger brother. Overall I'm totally satisfied.",

            "The phone has a supreme build and a sturdy feel in hands. Coming from a 6S, I felt it was a bit too wide, but It\u2019ll grow on you. The RED is by far the best color among available. And this one is an absolute battery champ and won\u2019t let you down. Charging is also pretty fast if you use a fast charger. I use an iPad 12W charger to top it up and it goes from 10% to 90% within 90 mins. If we take in the factor of longevity of the iPhones (iOS support and updates for atleast next 5 years), this is definitely worth it.",
            "I\u2019m upgrading from iPhone SE, the things i liked in iPhone Xr is\nBrilliant super bright display\nGreat performance\nGood battery backup\nGood cameras\nBigger screen\n\nThing I don\u2019t like\nIt is much heavy.

            "I feel as if the people who gave the iPhone XR low ratings either didn't know what they were getting or didn't do research. I did a lot of research about the XR by watching a lot of Youtube videos of what the XR had to offer and the changes made from the previous iPhone models. The first thing is that the XR doesn't have a Finger Print Home Button, instead it uses Face Recognition to unlock it or a Pin Code. Second thing is that the Control Center has moved from swiping up from the bottom to swiping down from the top right corner. Third thing, it doesn't have 3D Touch, but now has Haptic Touch which doesn't bother me since I've never used the 3D Touch on previous devices. Fourth, since there's no Home Button, to close an app you'll need to swipe up from the bottom. Fifth, to do a screen shot you'll need to hold down the sleep/wake up button on the right side of the phone plus the volume up button located on the left side of the phone. Sixth, to turn the phone off completely you'll need to hold down the sleep/wake button plus the volume down button, then slide the slider to the right. Seventh, the screen resolution is lower compared to my previous iPhone 7 Plus, i can honestly say that i can't tell the difference. Eight, the camera is a single lens compared to the dual lens on the iPhone 7/8 Plus, it still takes great pictures though. It took getting used to with the new features. All in all in very happy with my iPhone XR. So what it comes down to is If you prefer the Home Fingerprint Button and 3D Touch then stick with an iPhone 8 Plus or below, if you like the dual lens camera then stick with the 7/8 Plus, If you're one of those people who can't live without a headphone jack then stick with the iPhone 6s Plus and below. I hope my review helps you with your decision to whether to get the iPhone XR or not. Oh yeah one last thing, the battery life on the iPhone XR is amazing!",
            "Awesome \u2764\ufe0f. Just go for it. I am very happy with my decision for buying XR instead of iPhone 8 Plus, X, XS and XS Max. Here are the comparisons among these models which made it easy for me to decide to buy this iPhone\n\nScreen:\n1. This iPhone has HD screen but others have full HD. Still it doesn\u2019t disappoint me while watching full HD video.\n2. Perfect screen size, Not too big(8 Plus, XS Max) and Not very small(iPhone X or iPhone XS).\n\nDesign:\n1. All these models (except 8 plus) have new iPhone design which looks good and similar.\n\nCamera:\n1. iPhone Xs, Xs Max and XR have same camera quality which are better than X and 8 Plus. iPhone XR has only one Rear camera and others have two. But the picture quality is still better than X and 8 Plus.\n\nPerformance, features and other specs:\n1. iPhone Xs, XS max and XR have better performance compare to X and 8 Plus. Among all these models iPhone XR has longer battery life.\n2. iPhone XR may have got some one or more less features compare to Xs, XS max, but those are really not necessary to have.\n3. In term of performance iPhone XR are similar to XS and XS max. And better than X and 8 Plus.\n\nPrice:\n1. Little higher than 8 Plus but with new design, good camera and good performance I am ok with price and Price is still lesser than X, XS and XS max.",
            "1) Awesome Display - Yes i had done lot of research and people out there were saying about it pixel density, but in reality when you hold this side by side to any phone you will be surprised how good the phone actually is.\n2) Speed - It is just super duper speed, you will be surprised to see that it handles 30-40 apps without tiny lag\n3) Camera - Though it has single lens, it is far better than those andriods having 48MP's.\n4) Battery - This is big advantage of buying this phone as it has LCD display, it wont dry your battery like IphoneX does. 50% charge moderate use you will get full day.\n5) Colors - I thought of buying Red one but at the time of buying it was not on HDFC offer so bought my all time favourite Black. But next day Red was on offer - but i am happy though.",
            "I upgraded from Iphone SE, and let me tell you it is by far the best iPhone you\u2019ll ever have. Value for money, Good camera, Amazing battery life which lasts about 8 hours if you use it excessively. If you don\u2019t, you won\u2019t even have to charge for the whole day. Buying this phone was the best decision I\u2019ve ever made.",
            "I am new to the apple scene and I gotta say I picked an awesome phone to start with. I know it is 2 years old but I bet neither the camera or the processor is outdated. It can keep up with most other bran new smart phones which was released this year.\n\nI am writing this review after almost 1 month of use.\n\nDisplay: I don't see any problem in this LCD. It is very accurate and I barely feel the need for an OLED.\nBattery: I get backup for a whole day with around 6-7 hrs of screen on time .\nCamera: Like I said it keeps up with the meta even after 2 years.\nLooks and quality: Well I don't have to say anything yea? The build quality is amazing and each time I remove the back case, it is a beauty to behold.",

            "My second iphone after 6S. It's really a beast. After two years from date of launching still it's ahead of most of the android phones. If anyone is confusd between OnePlus and iphone than go for iphone. I have used 6S for four years, did not found any lag even with very heavy usage and after that I sold it at a decent price. Resale value is always great in iPhone.\n\nWith great price we get a very decent product.",
            "Glad I had bought this phone at 45k before the process went up.\nPerformance is top notch, the A12 BIONIC chipset is a beast.\nCamera is great and HDR kicks in automatically to bring that extra detail in the photos and videos.\nHighly recommended.",
            "Now used for almost a week. Performance is great with A12 bionic chip. Almost no lag. Battery lasts for a day with normal usage of online streaming, social media, gaming. Camera is good with great colour accuracy but low light performance is not as expected considering the premium pricing. Overall decent using experience. Blue colour looks cool without case, though one should use case to avoid scratches and glass breaks from unwanted falls. Though 3 gb ram but ram management is excellent. Happy with the product.",
            "I\u2019ve bought this phone in 2021. The phone has an amazing battery life and camera. The screen has a resolution of 720p only but it doesn\u2019t look bad at all in real life. I would give the phone a 10/10 in all departments. The only real let down is that there\u2019s no Fast charging brick in the box or infact no charging brick at all. I ordered this phone twice, first from supercomnet seller and then from truecomretail. The order from supercomnet never came through. I waited for more than 3 weeks for the order, then Flipkart called me and told me that the seller doesn\u2019t have it in stock. The second order from truecom retail got delivered in 5 days. Although the order was shipped from Delhi itself and was to be delivered in Gurgaon. I guess that was due to the pandemic, so no worries. Overall the phone is amazing even in 2021, will last for 3-4 years easily with a single battery change at the 2.5-3 year mark.",

This is my first ever iphone and trust me guys I was confused between this and newer model like SE2 OR 11 OR 12 but this beast is nothing less than the newer ones. I was luck enough to get the charger and earpods with it. It's so smooth, battery life is also good. Camera is beyond expectations!! Go for it it'll never let you down. Getting all the iOS update like the other new models. Just a advice to buy a fast charger adapter it'll be beneficial as it cahrges in half of time than the one's in the box as it's 5 watts charger. I bought boat 18 W fast charger and it charges like a beast. XR IS STILL YHE BEAST!! GO FOR IT. NO lagging and no issues with it.",

            "I am writing this review after almost 9 month, reason being, i didnt want to rush it by giving half baked reviews.\nThis phone is undoubtedly the best phone among all the phones i have ever used, this phone is all about the useful things at their best and no gimmicks or unnecessary things.\nDesign and look depends on individual, so leaving this on you.\nJumping to pros and cons\nPros :\n1.best feature i like about this is the battery drains only when you use it, and thus it lasts longer and spends the whole day on a single charge.\n2. Sound quality from speaker as well as from earpiece is loud, crisp and clear.\n3. Haptic feedback in this phone is a true delight, while typing or while scrolling options in a menu. (That \"tic tic\" sound \ud83d\ude01)\n4. Night mode in this phone makes it more comfortable during night and dim lighting.\n5. Switching between apps and simultaneously using multiple apps is effortless.\n6. Back Camera is good, video quality is amazing.\n7. Pubg in this phone is one different experience, use it in high frame rate and u will feel the difference, the smoothness is great.\n\nCons :\n1. Drains battery really fast when playing heavy games.\n2. Fast charger not included in the box.\n3. Its not an easy task to use any custom ringtone,you have to go through a pre defined procedure using \"garageband\" to set custom tunes.\n4. While connecting to wifi hotspot you have to keep that \"personal hotspot\" page open.\n5. Front camera is not so great, okay for video calls.\n\nThese are some points which in my opinion falls under pros and cons and may help you in deciding best for yourself. \ud83d\ude0a",

This display has 322 ppi pixel density\u2026 if you don\u2019t know then Samsung\u2019s latest phone Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 has a 366ppi pixel density ! Now decide yourself ! And if you\u2019re thinking about updates then you\u2019re getting 3 years of software update and 1 year security patch update by the time I\u2019m writing this review ! The battery backup is very good if you\u2019re a regular user ! If you\u2019re a gamer then you\u2019ll get almost 4 hours of gaming with a single charge and brightness at 50% \u2026 performance is beastly despite being a 2.5 year old phone .. camera is absolute beast just lacking night mode if you\u2019re a night shooter then go for iphone 11",

            "I was initially skeptical about buying an XR or SE2. Finally, bought XR for its battery capacity and a larger screen. The screen was not really an issue as I used 5s for 4 years.\nAfter using it for a week, here are my observations:\n1. It's a great phone for everyday usage with a decent camera.\n2. Battery lasts really long even if you use it for a longer duration including Netflix, prime, youtube.\n3. Camera is good too. You can take good pics and selfies with a portrait mode. Also, can use the camera extensively as the battery lasts long.\nThe iPhone 11 has a better camera, but XR was in my budget.\n4. Performance is great with all my office email and chat apps working fine with additional apps.\n5. FaceId works really well.\n6. Handling and dimensions are up to the current trend.\n7. Screen is not bad for an LCD phone.\n\nSo, it's the best phone in 40-45k range. I gave a miss to 11 due to budget and also it is not compatible with 5G.",

            "Nothing much to write about this product, great phone. Very quick to use. Some key points\n\n1 - Moving photos from android is a pain, Apple wants to ultimately ensure that you're locked into it's ecosystem.\n\n2 - Battery life is ok, with a reasonable amount of use, it can last for a day.\n\n3 - Camera is great in light, but night photography is where this phone lags ( Guess Apple has nailed night photography finally with iPhone 12 ).\n\n4 - I expect the phone to last about 4 years for me. This phone was launched in 2018, so it should receive updates for the next 3--4 years.\n\n5- Apple phones have a great resale value even if I want to switch later on.\n\n6 - buying an iCloud subscription is a great feature for sharing photos. Default storage of 5 gb doesn't cut it. 50 gigs for Rs. 75 and 200 gigs ( shareable with family) for Rs. 220 might seem pricey, but the peace of mind is worth it.\n\n7 - In the long run, you'll see small nudges from Apple to pay for apps or if you're health conscious, buy an Apple watch. Apple watch integration with health apps is far more superior to that of Fitbit.",

            "If you're considering iPhone XR in 2021, I think it is still a good choice and definitely a better buy than the SE which looks a decade old.\nLet's break down its various aspects-\n\nDISPLAY:\nYour screen is something that you constantly look at. I won't say it is the best screen out there in this price range because it's an LCD panel instead of an OLED with a pretty low resolution. But are you going to notice it in daily use? No, unless you're pixel peeping or use to high quality QHD+ OLED panels.\n\nDESIGN:\nNot that it matters to me, but to some people it does so, I would say since all the iPhones (even the latest ones) still use the same design with some minor changes it certainly does not feel outdated. A glass sandwich design with aluminium frame. (feels premium in hand as every Apple device out there)\n\nPERFORMANCE:\nAlthough, the phone launched in 2018, it doesn't feel slow by any means. A12 Bionic is still capable of competing with the recent high end phones and certainly outperforms any upper midrange device. So, no issues there. Moreover, everything in iPhone is well optimised.\n\nCAMERA:\nWell, it was a flagship when it was launched so camera is great. It only has One primary lens compared to other phones in 2021 which offers 3-4 lens as well as bigger sensors and higher MP count. So, it does not have the versatility but the single camera output is still better than any midrange device. Just one thing, if you prefer your photos to be vibrant, overly saturated and some beautification like Oppo and Vivo does, this is not for you. iPhone colour science is more inclined towards a natural looking output which some people absolutely love and some people just don't.\n\nBATTERY:\nWhen it was launched, it was the longest lasting iPhone out of the bunch. And I feel it is still going to be the same since it offers LCD panel which consumes less power and A12 is quite battery efficient. So battery life should not be a problem.\n\nOS AND UPDATES:\nThere is no need to explain how smoothly iOS runs. Coming to the updates, you must be wondering how long is it going to get updates? Is it good to buy after 3 years of its launch? Well, you get major updates for 5 years and 6 years of Security updates whereas Androids OEMs usually give 2-3 years of Updates. Do the maths, it is probably going to last you more than an android midrange that's for sure.\n\nOTHER PERKS:\nWireless Charging\nIP Rating",

I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not gonna change this mobile for min 2yrs. I\u2019m enjoying allot. Thanks to the Flipkart I received delivery in less than 2days.",
            "The phone was a gift for my father. Apart from being on the heavier side, I didn't find an issue with the phone. The hardware, fit and finish and display are spectacular in every way. My Dad being a music lover claims that this is the best sound quality he had ever experienced on any other mobile device! Price could have better though. I still feel the product is overpriced even though I purchased for 54k after heavy discounts. But as long as my father is happy, all is forgiven! :)",
            "This is my first apple product and it\u2019s truly worth the price. Sooner than expected delivery by flipkart, the phone was received in brand new condition and I checked the warranty and authenticity on apple\u2019s site and it\u2019s genuine. iOS is so smooth and amazing, Face ID works like a charm and given the updates till 2023 this phone is the best in 2020. This won\u2019t disappoint you at all. I had heard a lot of criticism about the display but it\u2019s just amazing, a normal consumer won\u2019t bother about lcd and oleds.Thankful to flipkart and Supercomnet for this amazing iPhone ,Apple is always miles ahead of it\u2019s competitions, so go for it.",
            "After discount at 54000 this mobile is best due to top class built and best ever OS. Very good camera .",
            "The iPhone XR is best Phone forever. Because the best battery life, Best Camera, Best Ultra Liquidretina Display. Mostly the phone Like premium look & Quality. I Recommend 8.5 out of 10. Good Products at 2021.",
            "The product is good but seller isn\u2019t good because i had ordered the phone during offer period and after the offer ended seller was telling me to cancel the order from my side and reorder it again I don\u2019t know why which by then price was hiked back to its normal rate. I had to literally wait for one complete month for the product to be delivered that too by contacting customer care like around 7-8 times and requesting them like anything.",
            "I jumped from Android to iOS with much excitement n this iPhone XR didn\u2019t disappoint me. Its such a smooth os experience n performance. Great display good battery life awesome touch n feel ok camera. Its a good buy for iphone lovers!",

            "I wanted very secure phome in this time when cyber crime is going to upscale. There is no phone in market above 30000 which provide chip level security. ios is more secured than android no doubt. So it was a wise decision from my side to choose iphone xr with decent battery life and every year update i am sure upto 2025. So anybody who think of having a fast phone with security can go with iphone xr",
            "One the best iPhone out market. Trust me the display is one of the best with most accurate colour reproduction. In terms of speed its like a monster with excellent battery life which can last upto a day and a half for a moderate to heavy use.",
            "I first took the feedback from my friends and all said it has good battery quality so why waste money in 11,11 pro or 12 when XR gives you good value for money. \ud83d\ude42I never bought mobiles online , this is my first purchase and it was excellent \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udc4d. Also I suggest to take a video and check the parcel when the delivery man delivers the item in door step.\n1.Good camera\n2.Long battery life\n3.It comes with cable, Adapter and Earpods\n4.Touch and accesibility excellent.\n5.I loved the size as it comes handy.\nI would say Good for it.",
            "I loved it.. Camera is a superlike, Performance is awesome, and most important battery backup is great. I love this more than 11",
            "One of the best decisions I have ever made. When I switched from android to iOS, I thought it\u2019s going to be difficult but it wasn\u2019t. This phone is amazing. It\u2019s fast, have a great battery life, awesome camera (inspite of no night mode, which I don\u2019t need) and flawless performance. Perfect!",

            "For someone who had been stuck with Android all his life, this was first IOS change. The phone bought during big billion days costed around 40k which again was a pretty well bargain for 128 gb version. Pretty convenient in use and camera quality is simply amaze. The battery issue in X are like non existent here (I guess also depends on usage). For me who uses it for like max 3-4 hours a day, it lasts almost 1-1.25 days in single charge (maybe I don't use pretty heavy usage apps apart from social media ones)\n\nAll in all, best deal.",
            "My first iphone\ud83d\ude0d. I loved it. Very nice product. Red colour is awesome. Great battery backup, it can compete with latest iphones in 2021. Display not bad because of LCD. Apple nailed it with LCD display. Worth for money.\n\nDelivered on next day. Thanks to flipkart.",

I love apple products always \u2026been using iPhone 6s from last 5 years.now I purchased this one for my brother.\n\nSurprised one thing that package does not have any accessories\u2026except type-c cable.\n\nLooks like apple started looting people money in the name of green environment \u2026 if that is the case why apple selling their accessories separately \u2026?? Definitely they should not make or sell accessories\u2026this is the best way protect our environment.\n\nApple seems to be following AP LIQUOR Policy: \u201cIf alcohol prices rise, people will stop drinking\u201d after effect this policy\n\u201cDrinking people have doubled and government revenue has tripled\u201d .\n\nStop looting people money in the name of green environment.",
            "I have been using the phone for 1.7 years and i bought this phone on sale for 35.5K rupees which is an absolute steal for that time.. and the phone performance like battery backup , camera, gaming perf is bang on great even now, also i am currently on ios 14.5 and still running smooth AF. Best ios experience.. so far thanks Flipkart for selling such genuine product. The seller from which i got was SuperComNet",

            "Excellent experience so far....... switched from android and loving the IOS very much. Blazing fast performance, good camera bundled with a snappy processor. A12 Bionic chip does its job as its best. No complains so far regarding performance. Unmatched Face ID performance. Too much accurate even in low lighting conditions. Loved it.

            "I have used this phone for like 1 week and then giving this review .\nI bought it for 43 k (128 GB) model white.\nPros-\n1-Flipkart delivered it in the estimated amount of time for me it was 2 days and it was delivered to me the same .\n2- Camera Quality is awesome u can click large amount of photos live or not live according to you choice . Also you can record slow-mo , time lapse etc at 240 Fps which makes it worth buying .\n3- You can also record 4k video with this phone at 60fps .\n4- Touch response and face ID recognition is at its best in this phone\n\nCons--\n1- Battery drains a little but if you dont perform any heavy tasks it will work roughly for 2-3 days .",
            "Even in 2020 if people are smart than they will buy this instead of one plus 8t. Also, buy an apple 12 w usb fast charge adapter for fast charge.",
            "My first iPhone, i moved it from android and its very worth in every aspect. Camera is natural and its performance, battery is like beast. Totally i loved alot..... \u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f XR \ud83d\udd25",

            "Battery management of IPhone XR is pretty good having 6hr screen time. I guess 3GB Ram is sufficient for this phone as I don\u2019t see any lagging. But again it depends how you use the phone.\n\nCamera is quite impressive. And if you have doubt against look wise and then ya that BIG NOTCH will make you irritate.\n\nIt supports wireless charging too. It\u2019s heavy comparable to Redmi or one plus , Due to build design.",
            "Some time there is a network problem. Price is very high as Compared to other phone which is available in market. If ur iPhone lover the u can go for it. It is better then iPhone XS.",
            "Awesome phone as apple always rocks and Flipkart super fast delivery made my day. phone is superb no lags and battery backup is also superb. I suggest to buy although price is slightly higher but it is ok when u strat using this phone.",
            "1) This is my first iPhone. The phone comes installed with iOS 13.7 and an update of iOS 14 ready to be downloaded. I struggled to download the update, as it requires a high speed wifi and won't download on mobile data. As the download size is 3.4 GB, the download sometimes stops for no reason and it happens to many iPhones world wide.\n2) Display is satisfactory. I have been using only android phones till now, and the last phone had a Full-HD screen. However, there isn't any noticeable difference between both the displays.\n3) Camera is convincing if you have normal usage and not a photography enthusiast.\n4) Battery - So far so good. Only strange thing is that, the battery percentage increases once you restart your phone. For normal usage, it will easily last more than a day. For gamers, less than a day. Charging slows down after it reaches 85%.\n5) No heating issues as such. But yes, the back panel gets slightly warm, when used for more than an hour. Having thick back covers may not be a good idea.\n6) Call quality is great. RAM management is also convincing.\n7) I received the phone on 27/4/2021. The phone was manufactured in September 2020.\nOverall a good product, so far.",
            "After using for few months, I would just like to say that after using iPhone, u would not like android again. Specially talking of iPhone XR, this is the first iPhone with excellent battery backup, camera, usage and sound.",
            "I really loved this everything is perfect in this device also flipkart gives me a good support and best service.",
            "This is my first iPhone. Before it, I was confused between XR and 11. But I purchased XR and I am very happy to see this that XR is copy paste of 11.\nI am very happy to get this. I am reviewing this comment after 1 month of using this phone. I bought this on 37K. Very reasonable price.",
            "I hope no doubt in Apple product.\nit's very great and super. If I talking about Feature so everything is perfect most important thy is your data security. So Apple always fallow up to secure your data, if you compare Android device.\nIf you want security so no doubt apple is best .",
            "Phone is good for the first time user of iPhone but not for the other iPhone user who thinks its latest version compared to 8plus this will be degraded version of apple , i donno y this one is not even a full hd display? Its lukg lyk below 10k android phones display, no 3d touch is tolerable bcaz i wont use ofter, upgraded were processor which is a sec faster than a previous nd camera even single portrait was fabulous but viewing that image in this display was lukg bit bad if we transfer that to other model lukg great those pics, my conclusion not worth for 70k this is lyk 5c which disappointed me previously.",

            "The product is amazingly good. I loved it based on my day 1 usage. Camera is definitely the best part of this phone. People who don't want to change thier phone for 2 to 3 years should buy it considering you will get security updates at least till 2023 and the processor is capable enough to work for next 2-3 years easily",
            "Amazing phone with a very powerful battery. Its the most practical iPhone. Though it has a LCD display it still feels premium n feels the best. It's the best choice if being upgraded from iPhone 7 or 8 or any lower iPhone models. Nothing to think of it its the best in the range, the camera, the built, the battery are really powerful.. A worthy purchase",

            "Can't tell u how good this phone is. however if you don't like iOS it's better to go for the other options like the S10 and OnePlus 7 Pro. but if you need to buy an iPhone in India, there is no better value for money phone than the xr.",
            "Switched for the first time to iOS ..it's a different experience altogether as it takes some time to get use to it. Initially it was tough buy after using it for 1month it was Ok. Products hardware and software is good with no lags. Touch is super smooth. Some features are missing if compared to Android which I was using since last 10 years\nOverall it's a good experience and I beleive that after using for few more days, it will become more friendly.",
            "I was a bit skeptical about purchasing a phone online however had a great experience, I bought iPhone XR as a gift for my sister and she really loved it so thank you Flipkart for arranging everything so well, from the shipping to the delivery. And not to forget the delivery boy, he was a great guy, I haven\u2019t received any link to provide feedback for him who\u2019s from EKart I guess however would like to extend gratitude towards his service too.

            "There's no comment on this phone's performance, look, and value for money.\n\nThe best thing about purchasing this phone from Flipkart is that they would call you to check if you get the right product or have any issues. This was the first time I got this kind of call from Flipkart. It's really good customer service and it will build great customer base for sure. Thank you, Flipkart.",
            "Here is my short and simple review after switching from Motorola G5s plus to iphone XR\n\nPros\n1. Lag free fluent software.\n2. Amazing Camera. (better than my Cannon 1500D DSLR.\n3. Security from apps stealing personal info.\n4. Screen is LCD but looks like Amoled.\n5. Midway price between Iphone SE 2020 & Iphone 11.\n6. Guaranteed s/w updates for next 3-4 years.\n7. Charger and earphones (Earpods) are included.\n\nCons.\n1. Battery drain.\n2. Using Face id in corona time is difficult.\n3. If you are gamer then dont buy iphone instead go for mi 10 ultra or Oneplus 8t or Rog phone 2.\n4. Apple s/w and h/w ecosystem is expensive.\n5. Though waterproof , water damage is not covered under warranty.\n6. When you are coming from android then you find difficulties operating iphone such as file transfer or you can not simply copy paste any song / file from pendrive or laptop.\n7. Whatsapp backup from android to iphone is not easy and you will have to buy separate third party softwares.\n8. Each and every app installation or settings change require apple id password, so use face id.",

            "After 15 days of usage rear camera is good front camera is ok. U wont notice HD display until u consume some media display is noticeably less sharp in youtube videos battery life is good",
            "Fantastic beast it is. Looks stunning just upgraded from iPhone 7. In between I used pixel 3 but I am not satisfied so I returned back to I phone family.",
            "Not sure why I bought this. Must be an accident. Why? Will,\n\n1. Display is not even Full HD. Retina display is a gimmick.\n2. Camera is overrated. Nothing's extraordinary about it.\n3. Performance, well, if you're not allowed to customize, not installing apps or games, how will you calculate performance? Remember, Windows 10 S? It's same.\n4. OS is nothing special, like the android. Only miss the Lumia phones!\n5. Battery is so so. Better not talk about it. Oh yes, this model comes with a charger!\n6. Price is almost 2.5 times higher than it should be.\n7. Photos are not extraordinary. Nothing to talk about it. Pretty petty.\n8. Yes, it overheats.\n\nI regret the purchase.",
            "It's Apple. So no questions on overall quality.\nIt's just that XR could have been more better from camera and screen resolution/pixel density standpoint.\nPhotos come out pretty well but could have been better.

            "As expected both phone and delivery are excellent and as per scheduled time. Phone is beautiful crimson red with obvious smooth feather touch and clear display. I got great deal too at 37,999/-.\n\nOnly downside is apple is not providing charging adapter and earpods with it(citing environmental reason). I have already ordered it. I will be able to explore further Detailed features only after i receive the charger (i choose apple original).",
            "Very good display. In fact best LCD display. Amoled displays cause eye strain but LCD display does not. So people having sensitive eyes should go with LCD displays only. Camera is very good too. Moderate usage gives one full day of battery. Performance is good. May be iPhone 12 performs better than this but for day to day usage this is more than enough. Overall the most value for money iPhone.",
            "At first I must say it's not that bright red it's beautiful cherry red. And it's 100% real and I did all the reality check. Battery is not that long lasting but it can give you backup of 18 hours if you use it so much. Display and camera is outstanding. Super handy and gorgeous. I am now a satisfied Iphone xr user \ud83d\ude0a",

            "First of all, I have to thank Flipkart logistics for the super fast delivery. The specs of the phone is not what I expected, they are superb. Picture clarity and sound quality is almost out of this world. What I had not expected was the seller\u2019s promise of supplying lightning connector and EarPods with connector would be fulfilled. That is what clinched the deal for me. Now the price has increased by 4000/-. So all in all, I am a very happy Flipkart customer.",

            "Excellent phone. Battery performance is unlike other iPhone models. Minor itch is in respect of selection of sim in auto SMS requirements like google pay. A safe bet for secured financial transactions",
            "Got it at 36.5K. At this price, you get a flagship phone with guaranteed performance for 5 years and then resale value. Display is not the best Apple has but it still amazing to look at, no complaints at all. Maybe you will run out of storage if you click too many photos and videos, since its camera is exceptionally good.\n\nBest part is the 4K video recording with stabilization. If you know how to shoot, you can take cinematic videos from this phone. You can check my video on youtube, search \"Maheshwar short film iphone\" and you will be amazed at how sharp and stable the camera movements are even when handheld. It has just one wide angle camera which is made of fine optics and the software processing gets the best out of it.\n\nRight now, iPhone 11 is worth the extra 10K but this phone is by no means dated. The performance is just mind blowing fast as expected from iPhone. One can expand memory by using Google Photos/Drive or just using a lightning USB 3.0 pen drive.\n\nNice to have the basics like lightning cable and power adapter. Also the earpods are great to have. Just makes it worth it with their excellent sound quality.",

            "Very awesome phone. I love this variant of iPhone. Great performance nice display awesome camera and battery backup is also good. All these things are good but if Apple will give a fast charger with box then it was fully complete package.",

            "It is a awesome phone. iPhone are well known for secure data & pictures and bank accounts app. Next people who thinks that iPhone are always costly than android. They should also think about versions of network data speed like 2g 3g 4g. In android phone when india adopt 4g network then all 2g and 3g android phones were unable to work with 4g sim with 4g speed whereas old iPhone works smoothly with speed with 4g network sim with speed, so in case no need to change iPhone for next next network. Only update iPhone software with smile and forget all worries about network change. Think iPhone Think Big .. Thank you to understand and read complete review.

            "I am writing this review after 1 week of use.. This is best phone you can go for.. moving from android to ios i was in a big doubt that will it be the good decision to buying the apple iphone but after purchase i love it. Battery performance is super more than any mi or samsung etc.",
            "Very smooth performance. nice camera quality. We can open multiple apps mobile wont get struck.. there is not much difference between phone11 and xr except nightmode wide angel lens. Value for money. Go for it",
            "I have used iPhone 7 128gb variant. That phone was pretty good but the battery performance is not good. I was to supposed to charge the battery twice a day. Now in iPhone xr i have to charge only one time at the morning and seriously it gives me about 14-24hrs of battery backup (depends on the usage). Camera is awesome, battery is awesome, display is good not bad. Overall i will give the xr 4.8/5 rating.",
            "Well, its been 7 long years that I stopped using an Iphone and moved to Android. But boy oh boy I must say I missed my Iphone every single day and then I finally bought the XR Black after a long wait. All I can say is the wait was absolutely worth it and im enjoying my phone every single time I use it and it gives me great joy just looking at it. Once an iphone always an iphone!!!!",
            "I bought this mobile after some research and I am satisfied with this mobile.\nIf you are looking for an iPhone under 45000k, then XR is your mobile. Great battery backup ,dual sim, good camera and best performance.. just go for it.",
            "Undoubtedly great single camera both front & back . Excellent battery. Super fast processor. Smooth experience. Great built quality. Feels premium in hand. At Rs35,000/- (that too with emi during big billion days offers) , perhaps the best smartphone value for money, one can buy in 2020. Thanks to Flipkart.",
            "Phone is super at lowest price best offers best deals Flipkart is best",
            "Great product for the prices iPhones are best value when bought after an year or so of its launch.\nGot it for an amazing price smooth experience so far great cameras great battery life when compared to iPhone X.\nDisplay is good too nothing to complaint about\nPrrformance is at par with every android flagship on sale\nGo for it if on a good price it will last for at least 2-3 years on ios support.",
            "This is my first iPhone. Great processing power. You can easily do live stream while playing free fire without experiencing any frame drop. Camera quality is great in daylight condition but not that good in night light condition. It captures natural color. Battery backup is good for a 3000mAH battery.",
            "Bought XR black 128 gigs. Absolutely Worth and value for money 40-45k budget.\nPros easily out weigh cons. Go for it.\n\nPros:\niOS. No nonsense.\nSecurity.\nPerfect size. Not too big nor small.\nLiquid Retina display\nCamera is good\nBuild quality, glass back & premium feel\nFace unlock is super quick\nA12 Bionic chip. Excellent performance.\nLightning connector headset quality\nApple woo factor.\n\nMinor Cons:\nFinger print unlock feature could have helped\nPhone weight in hand\n5w Charger takes 3-4 hours for full charge\nOn full charge, Battery comes for ~6-7 hours call & social media consumption to gather.",
            "I was so lucky to get this product in 35k.\nPros- Long battery life my screen on time is more that 6hr never thought would get this much.\nNo legging issue whatsoever, Despite being a heavy user.\nAwesome Camera but front camera is not that good compared to other phones. 15k phone front camera can beat it.\nCons-\nSlow charger provided in the box.\nI find this phone to be on the higher side in terms of weight.\n\nIf you are kind of guy for whom front camera is not the key point than you wont find anything good this price range.\nTrust me from price to performance ratio it is even better that iPhone 11 and IOS 14 security features are just great",
            "Fast delivery by flipkart mobile is fantastic for this price range camera is awesome and pubg plays smoothly ....not sure about battery will update about it later....go for it.",
            "It\u2019s been almost a month now and I love the experience.. Should buy and yes red color looks super sexy \ud83d\ude01",
            "Phone is awesome... takes time to charge almost 3:30hours to get 0 to 100% although supporting fast charge but you have to purchase a genuine 18 w charger for it. Camera is overall good. Premium looking phone",
            "Excellent phone with high speed processor has very decent features and battery life is best among the iPhone models and also suitable for gaming with good graphic.\nOverall can buy without second thought.",
            "This is my first iphone and i would say its awesome .\nCamera is very good\nBattery life is really awsome its stands more than 1 and half day .\nPhone is really very smoth when you play Pubg while opened multiple apps in background.",
            "Best iphone in this budget\nGives a feel of premium phone\nCamera is excellent\nBattery once charged gives a full day usage to normal user\nIt is worth buying",
            "iPhone is best phone I love it good performance nice camera",
            "It has been wonderful experience using this phone and going back to Apple. This my 8th iPhone and it still amazes me with its ease of use and simplicity.",
            "The Iphone XR has a great camera, good processor and a very good body finish. But the battery backup isnt yet that great. If you use your phone for normal usage like instagram music WhatsApp it lasts for 6-7 hours at max. Battery drops by 1% every 2-4 minutes. The battery is a big issue when it comes to regular users. Rest all works awesome.",
            "9-Aug-2019: My first brave step to choose iOS and I don't repent my decision.\n1. Compared to Android iOS is so smooth. Super fluidic response and also the security is great.\n2. Moving from Android, you need a lot of time to get used to iOS as it's not as easy usage as Android.\n3. Activated airtel eSIM in just 2 hours which works exactly like physical SIM.\n\nDisadvantage: There is no finger print reader. This could have been given behind where the apple logo is making it almost invisible to know that there's finger print reader.",
            "Good Quality best working better than iphone 11",
            "Awesome\nBattery back up - full day net on WhatsApp live location on 9am to 10 pm , at 11.30 20% remaining\n4k Vedio smoothly playing\nNo heating issue\nCamera equivalent to DSLR , some pop up camera in the market like 48mp its 12 on xr but 1000% better than that.\nRed is awesome ( Name Product Red, have a nobel cause also help the cancer patient )\nhot spot sharing also great\nI think its better than oled, amoled, Display\nits very Smooth to veiw ( just like Plasma TV vs Led TV )",
            "there is a confusion choose between android and ios ,Now listen me carefully ios gives you smoothest screen feel and performance is outstanding but it fall down in battery quick ,also takes lot of time to charge unless android have now fast chargers that really does the work fast .i would suggest go for one plus mobile they are now coming in more afforadable prices and phones gives premium feel like iphone.",
            "What? Nope, I didn't sell my kidney, because I am rich. But not that rich, else would have bought iPhone 11 Pro Max XS Ultra whatever.\nSo what's good in this phone? People think I am Ok Rich. And it looks like the same iPhone 7 I had earlier. Even same wallpaper.\nWhat's Bad? My living room doesn't have the LG 4K 55\" TV I wanted cos I spend the money on this one.\nShould you buy? Yes, else how will Tim Rob Jobs Cooks or any Apple employee will buy the next Tesla? With your money of course.",
            "My first iphone and having a amazing experience\nBattery back up is too good\nCamera is awesome\nBest phone to buy in 2021\nI am so happy thank you flipkart\ud83e\udd70",
            "If u r going to buy iPhone then go for I phone 11 or upper versions. Performance wise I will say it is not the best phone in the market. The best thing about the iPhone is always it\u2019s hardware. The outer finish is just perfect & it looks really nice.",
            "Go for it instead of iPhone 11 you can buy iPhone xr every thing you got the same . Happy with the product but not with ekart because the didn\u2019t exchanged my old phone by making some non sense reasons and also they dot even have a swipe machine in their office the delivery boy said it will be 8-9 pm sir instead you can go office and collect your parcel .. overall phone is pretty good but not happy with ekart services",
            "Honest review after extensive use of 1 month.\n1. Battery backup is awesome. With internet on whole day and maximal use, battery percentage at end of the day is around 30-40%. This is so far the best battery I have seen in any apple product.\n2. Ease of access is also good. Especially the face id makes your locking and unlocking, payment experience smooth and joyful.\n3. Sound quality is awesome and with a screen size of 6.1 inch, serves a lot if you're watching a movie.\n4. Camera is not up to the mark. Single camera is there, but quality is not very good, at least not at par with other iphones.\n5. Only series of apple with dual sim.",
            "Classy Phone.\nFor people out there still confused about this phone, don\u2019t even have a second thought, just grab right away.\nIts been a couple of days I got this phone and I\u2019m totally in love with it.\nThank you Apple and thank you Flipkart for the quick delivery.",
            "Battery backup :\nI have been a android user since 2010 and used many android phones this last decade both high end and low end ones and I never had a mobile last me 2 full days of usage!\n\nAndroid vs iOS :\nI want to point out both android and iOS have their merits and demerits but as a consumer we should know exactly what we need in a phone before deciding on the Os .\n\niOS is comparably slow to android but that's just the extra animations in iOS you could equate iOS to oneui or miui in terms of speed but they both are not as smooth and polished in the execution as iOS .\n\nCamera :\nIn both android and iOS devices it's always the same you get what you paid for , so if you're looking for the best camera in Apple ecosystem this phone not it but remember you will get your money's worth of camera provess so exact good photo and video clarity .",
            "This Product was such a good Quality. This IPhone XR Deign quality was very nice. & thank to flip kart to give good product and delivery. i am very frequent customer in flip kart. but i bought this product in flip kart i really appreciate the quality of delivery & easy to access online platform to buy such a good product. i suggest all the Apple Mobiles freaking people buy this product.",
            "Very nice phone with good durable built and colors, screen quality is also very nice. Everything is perfect about this phone except that it is a little heavier as compared to same segment of phones. Also price is on the upper side when compared to similar segment of phones but i guess that's an apple trademark ;)",
            "This is my first Apple phone having migrated from Android to iOS. My initial hesitation to be spending twice the amount on this apple phone vis-a-vis any good android phone has been laid to rest after having used this product for last 5 months.\nGo for this iphone if you have heavy calling requirements, normal camera usage and need to be assured of a lot of privacy from the snooping apps one does download these days. For me, the privacy part is enough reason to be opting for this reliable device.",
            "The item is simply beautiful. More so with its rich, vibrant RED color. Very well designed too. Got a good price along with exchange of my earlier iphone 6. This is the last of the model which came with a charger ( slow one though ) and earphones too. The display is bright and vibrant. Size of the phone is also good. It has weight. Iphone 6 was simply feather light. Everything is slick and fast. Happy with my upgrade and purchase. Easily recommended.",
            "Needed to upgrade my phone as I was using a 6s. It\u2019s a bit large and cannot easily use with on hand as I could the older phone. However performance is excellent and extremely smooth. Very responsive to touch and the Face ID is very responsive. Easy to unlock and have had no issues so far. Ear phones are wired and it has no 3.5 mm jack so older ear phones will not work with this. Overall, very satisfied with the purchase.",
            "Display is good enough for everyday use.Nothing to complain about.Camera is very good and and phone is smooth in any situation.Battery lasts for about a day which i think could have been better.It is a value for money product.",
            "Moving to IOS from Android is a top notch experience. User interface is amazing. Camera quality in light is amazing. Battery back is superb for normal use it almost comes for 1 and half day. Touch is very responsive. Face ID is flawless even in low light conditions. U can\u2019t expect more and it\u2019s a Must buy product in this range.",
            "I\u2019m using iPhone for several years but couple of things I noticed this time. I switched to this device from iPhone 7 and my feedbacks are -\n\nCons:\n- The phone is very heavy and thick even Galaxy A51 is thinner than this\n- The NAUTCH, oh my god \ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude33 its too big for that apple did lot of adjustments like battery percentage doesn\u2019t show, bluetooth connected device doesn\u2019t show\n- Camera will serve the purpose\n\nI personally don\u2019t like the big phones for me I guess iphone SE or 12 mini would be good.\n\nPros:\n- Performance is too good better than same range latest oneplus\n- Display is ips but it\u2019s very good near to Samsung Galaxy A51 super amoled\n- Face unlock its too fast. But now days there is a issue for the mask. And it\u2019s really very frustrating to unlock this huge heavy phone in one hand by entering the 6 digits pin \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\nTo solve this problem you have to purchase Apple Watch \ud83d\ude02\n\nFlipkart delivery was good.",
            "Very nice product in this price range (I've got this for 35999). Made in india, nice call quality nice, video recording, little disappointing about camera but it still better than so many phones at this range. I'm using it for past 3days and getting charging backup for nearly 8hrs, if its ur first iOS you will feel some uncomfortable but sure you enjoy useing it. If you have more budget go for 128gb.",
            "Really I couldn\u2019t stop thinking abt phone all the time man it\u2019s beautiful consistent and super fast ,my first experience with iPhone and I\u2019m having fun thanks a lot to Flipkart for delivering product in time and seller had it perfectly packed\nI\u2019m very happy with the purchase",
            "After searching for 5 months i got the best phone in 2020 which is indeed a 2018\u2019s launched phone. The processor, camera and battery is much better than i phone X. And obviously the value of money factor in comparison to i phone 11. Great !!",
            "Trust I\u2019m a fan of this device. Probably The best budget product form Apple. Hats off to this device. Top notch performance. Battery is awsome. You may heard that display is not good but trust me you\u2019ll find nothing less in this display. Truly good display quality, and as it\u2019s a lcd display it helps to reduce the battery usage much more than any other amoled display and neither it will hurt ur eyes. Just go for it.",
            "Got it as a gift for my better half on eve of our anniversary. Ideal if one wants to try out iOS after spending long time with Android (for a change in the usage/experience) the phone is available now at a cost effective price, would recommend to go for it!",
            "Amazing phone, upgraded from an iPhone 6s and this phone is a beast. White colour looks the best. Playing PubG at extreme frame rate now. Battery life is great can easily last your for two days if you are an average user. With games it lasts for a day.",
            "Very much satisfied with the flipkart delivery\nGot it for 36k in big billion day sale\nComing to device,\n1.The performance is mind numbing\n2.Battery is very efficient though (thanks to the 7nm tech a12 bionic)\n3.Dont mind the on paper specs of display,the display is crispy enough and supremely colour accurate(dont compare with amoled) and sufficient brightness even in bright sunlight\n4.Sound quality is awesome in this device both from earpods and stereo built in speakers\n5.Also no need to say particularly about built quality of apple devices,same here with various colour options.\n6.Face id works with in no time at all\n7.E sim works with out any issues as well.\n\nThings that bothers about this device are the\n1.Freaking 5w slow charger in the box even device is capable of fast charging(can upgrade with apple fast charger which works with usb-pd cable which costs more than 5k/-)\n2.Not providing the dongle(lightning to 3.5mm cable adapter which costs almost 900/-) in the box.\n3.even the display is good enough,in this price range if it comes with more pixel density with fullhd+ resolution it will be brilliant.",
            "Totally satisfied with the phone. Worth a buy if you need a smooth battery efficient mobile",
            "It's the best phone, It's better than iPhoneX as X have A11 bionic chip and XR have A12, XR has same camera as XS and XS Max. Also with better face reorganization, And the best battery of all.",
            "Nice mobile apps and performance is very good when compared to other China android mobiles in the market. But overall i still prefer android over iOS as it has more customisation . But if you are looking for mobile with great camera and performance then go for it",
            "It's an amazing product with high quality camera visibility.... it has a 6.1 inch display that is equal to iphone 11 pro... so it's worth it . N thank you flipcart for the fastest delivery",
            "I just got my xr from Flipkart the delivery was really quick I got it in within 3 days whereas the expected time was 4-6 days\nI am iOS friendly user I have using iPhone since iPhone 6 then 7 and now xr\nThe phone is very handy\nThe phone has a best quality camera although it has a same megapixel that of 7 but still it works more beautifully\nThe display is a bit yellowish due to its OLED display over all display experience it Gud\nThe battery is much improved in the xr as I frequently play games still it gives 10-12 hrs backup minimum\nThe touch is very smooth\nOverall this phone is perfect buy for me at Rs 65000.",
            "Functionality wise android is much superior. You will miss a lot of useful features like app lock, downloading of your favourite videos or songs after switching to iOS. Network issue is also there. My mi phone had better network reception than this phone. Camera and audio quality are superb in iPhone.",
            "Everything good but the main dis advantage is that it will get lot of time to get charged as no fast charging option is available",
            "If you are using a Android flagship, never buy an iPhone - EVER.\n\nI was using Oneplus 7T before this and bought for the iPhone brand coming back to Apple after 10 long years. I was extremely dissappoined.\nCons\n- Software is 3-4 generations behind Android in terms of user experience. Too many things difficult to do on iPhone, like even a copy paste selection\n- Touch is very difficult to manage. Most times it wont select right alphabets and sometimes touch itself is not sensitive\n- Resolution of XR is poor. I feel like going back 7-8 yrs coming from OP7T\n- Battery charging is pre historic era. Takes hours and hours. Modern Androids take it to full charge in 100min or less now. I mostly plug by iPhone overnight for charging. One nigth if I forget, I will never be able to full charge by phone - It takes way toooo long. Fast charger spec also doesnt feel like it will improve charging speed much.\n\nPros\n- Camera is good\n- Build quality is good\n- No lags\n\nBuy iPhone only for the brand show off. NOTHING ELSE",
            "okay so it has been 3 months using i phone XR and you won't believe how amazing it is.\nI was not convinced by this phone before I really wanted to purchase I phone 11 instead of this, but one of my friends suggested me to purchase this in 128 Gb variant it's totally better than the 11, in terms of battery life it looks good, cute, and catchy at the same time\nand most important thing you are not getting a power adapter and earbuds in the i phone 11 boxes.",
            "First time moved to IOS from Android. Excellent performance, great camera, good battery life and excellent gaming performance. Overall fully satisfied with this device. Sound quality is awesome. My rating to this device is 9/10",
            "Nicely packed delivered by sfxdel boy opened by my daughter and only delivery boy exit from my premises. This is my fourth iPhone. Xr was my dream because of the features, screen size and pricing.\nNow I updated with ios14 too.\nAm really happy. This time I choosed White colour, which is really a marvellous piece. Thank you Apple and flipkart.",
            "I was using one plus 7 before which is way better and cheaper than iPhone XR in every aspect,better display,better performance, better camera and better battery and more storage.i had to buy this phone simply for the Apple Watch otherwise I would have never bought iPhone XR.",
            "Wow wonder of I phone y people will like Ds nice build quality is superb sound \ud83d\ude0e camera \ud83d\udc51 nice phone",
            "A good seamless experience for most part, my dominant use is calls and basic usage of net so battery life was a priority, which is good and the phone can last 2 days on a single charge for basic usage. Overall a good package in terms of smoothness of OS, features and performance and not to forget a pretty convenient size for old school folks like me who want their phones to be handled by palms and not arms\u2026..",
            "Really I decided to purchased XR with the opinion of the peoples review but really i say the seller is very smart to sell best XR I\u2019m really very happy to have an this iphone thankyou Flipkart to drop a best price segment and best phone, a person needs that he get all best service in his budget and company never fraud them love this iphone",
            "Product is an original one, good and excellent but there are no EarPods and Charging Adapter as mentioned in the product description. So do not believe the description. It a pure marketing strategy. Saying one thing and delivering another thing",
            "Well,to begin with , I made a major switch... From a mid range xiaomi mobile to this... I was confused between one plus 9 r and this one... But believe me...this might be an old apple product but it wouldn't be in the market if it was capable....\n\nWhy to consider :\n* the camera quality in daylight is awesome.. Better than many android falgships..\n* if you are bored of using android for a long period of time..go for this\n* if security is one of your concerns while using an android device..switch to this ..ios has one of the best security standards...\n* awesome gaming performance ( runs pubg and cod mobile at highest settings without any lags or min frame skips ) ..\n* the apple logo on the back...no one plus or xiaomi or realme would turn heads like an Iphone does !!!\n\nWhy not to consider :\n* the battery runs a day at fair usage ( browsing through social media and texting ) and 5-6 hours at high usage ( gaming or video streaming )\n* screen size is good for people who are not a fan of big displays that require you to use both hand to operate ..but if you are...go for one plus instead\n* low light photography is average\n* you might require some time to adjust to the notch present in the display ..\nThat's all I could say after using the product so far.. Trust me..you wouldn't regret buying this one..",
            "I think this one is the best phone from Apple. Awesome display with a much improved battery performance compared to other variants. Extremely happy with the phone as well as the delivery. Kudos to the seller and Flipkart!!",
            "As a premium phone the quality of the product is nice. Well finished edges. Have a good battery life. For normal use the camera is okay.\n\nSatisfied. Worth for money.",
            "Awesome mobile. Battery backup is amazing comparable to android phones. Display is LCD but far better than android HD + display. Camera is the best thing of the phone.",
            "Apple XR is worth buying even in 2021. Perfect combination of art and technology. Storage and RAM is better than so called 8GB/256 GB phones. Camera is better than 48/64MP...Its quality which matters, not claimed specs.5 star for phone and quick delivery",
            "The product which is I ordered is genuine I am loving this I phone xr and enjoying to use this one thankyou Flipkart your trust is remarkable thanks again....",
            "Purchased a month ago in just 33000/-\nPROS:\n1. 1.5 days battery backup\n2. Best camera for capturing HDR pics\n3. Premium body\n4. Zero lag in multitasking\n5. Best speaker/mic for calling\n6. Sound at max with deep clarity for music/videos\n7. Both SIM (ESIM & Physical) are working fine together\n8. Best performance when gaming\n9. Quick charging\n\nCONS:\n1. Front screen require a guard all the time\n2. It is so smooth and slippery\n3. Quite big so have issue with holding in one hand\n\n\n(I will write a review again after 6months)",
            "I love iPhone it\u2019s best mobile for valuable money..\nalways prefer apple family for mobiles.",
            "Upgraded from Iphone 6, and I believe this is a really good deal at this price. Battery is excellent, display is great and the camera is just too good. Gives true natural colours.\nIt would have been good to get the fast charger along with it though. It's also a bit thick.",
            "This is a cool phone.\nWorth for its price i must say.\nThe user experience is amazing in every aspect i could think of. As Steve Jobs one said design is not not something you feel or see it\u2019s what you work with.\ni phone never disappointed me except for the price. And this one is worth it compared to other Samsung and google.",
            "Everthing is good but still iphone 7 plus have way more better speakers rather then XR and the camera quality is not very good. Further if you are looking for budge iphone then XR will be the best choice",
            "I loved it. it's beautiful. There's just this heating problem whenever I turn the hotspot on. Also battery isnt that great. You buy you buy a cover aswell, hella slippery. Audio quality is superb. The charging is slow(obviously) but yeah I used the 18w charger for my vivo, there's a significant loss in charging time. Camera is amazing but I wish there was a little more zoom. Face unlock works 98% of the times.",
            "Very nice phone my first iPhone got it with a good deal on BBD sales very much satisfied with the seller and Flipkart for a genuine product",
            "Awesome.. I liked the blue color, which is better than the image, i usually buy black but happy with blue this time, The Phone is nice and charging is faster.",
            "Purchased during big billion day...phone was delivered on time. I'm a first time iPhone user..little time taken to adjust to the changes in UI compared to android. Yet to completely understand the advantages of ios..2 major points...camera image quality is too good and color reproduction is excellent. Battery is good and for normal usage I'm getting for 1.5 days.",

            "The product is excellent!! Don't even think of neglecting this beast. I would this is the best phone You will get for 40k. Thanks to flipkart for such a superb deal. I was thinking to go for iphone X but I never regret of making a choice to go with Xr. A12 makes the way for a better world. Just go for it man.",
            "Thanks flipkart for delivering the product a day ahead.

The phone is capable of fast charging but you have to a buy fast adapter and a type-c to lighting cable which will cost you approx 3k if you will go with apple original... so before upgrading take time and think",

Performance is snappy and clean. Camera is good. Battery life is awesome. I get around 8 plus hour screen on time. Its way too bulky and weighs more. The main problem and serious problem is, it has got reception problem in LTE and WiFI. Signal strength sucks. I am kinda confused what to do. Have done a online research and found its common in XR model, since apple uses inferior intel modems in XR models. The problem is not persistent in XS model since it uses a superior modem. Apple thought XR is a really cheap model in the line so did this trade off which is considered a primary hardware an any smarphone. My oneplus 3 is too good to recieve LTE data whwn i campare both phones side by side. Any help will be appreciated. Thank you.",

Many times it doesn\u2019t autoconnect to wifi if connection broke in between.\n\nI loved the camera. Only think I don\u2019t like is the time it takes to charge.

Flipkart has refused to give any support foe the 55000 phone which has a big manufacturing defect!! whenever I start the camera app it makes a flickering noise, tries to focus on the object and fails to do so and gets abnormally heated near the camera portion. Feels like my fingers are going to burn! Once I switch off the camera, the device becomes normal.\n\nUpdate: So finally Flipkart has replaced the defective device and its looking like the current product is okay and working normally. Thanks Flipkart. However, Apple should do proper quality tests with their products before placing it in the market for sale! These are expensive products and we don't want to waste our time running for the authorised (?) apple resellers to repair a brand new phone that has a manufacturing defect since unboxed! Apple has NO RIGHT to ask the customer to visit an unauthorised Apple reseller (That's the only thing we get in India from Apple, since they don't have a genuine Apple store in India) with the defective phone and rather they should replace these defective phones right away, no questions asked!",

If you are a heavy gamer or mobile photographer you can go with other phones at this price.\n\nThe phone build quality is picture perfect with premium glossy metal and glass body. Phone is water proof with 1 meter, 30 min resistance, But I personally don\u2019t recommend you to use it under water as the water damage won\u2019t come under manufacturer\u2019s warranty.\nThe phone camera is okayish but not a deal breaker as it do not show fake colours like other china brands.\nUI is very smooth with no lag or bugs and very responsive.\n\nThe biggest turn off for this phone is the absence of finger print sensor. It comes with face recognition lock.As in 2021 we are living with masks it is bit annoying to type the passcode every time.",

Youtube and some other websites don't work on this phone properly, they get freezed. I ignored the problem first as this is my first iphone so , i thought the websites may be problematic because apple products are not supposed to get hanged, when you spend so much money for a phone you expect a good performance. I also dont play any games or use any heavy apps in my phone. When i complained flipkart, they said after seven days they cannot do anything. Only Apple can do it. 7 days is very short period to assess the performance of a phone. Flipkart should atleast give 15 days or one month time to exchange the phone/replace/exchange/ moneyback if there is any problem. When I called Apple, they said to update the ios, then tye problem will be resolved but even after updating my ios the problem still persists. I dont know whatbto do now, I am very dissapointed with flipkart. i didnt expect such type of service. Please dont purchase it from onlone. it is better to purchase it from apple store.",

YOU CAN NEVER OVER-CHARGE YOUR PHONE.\n\nCamera: I haven't explored much since I'm a basic user... Just for photos on parties and functions. Cool camera. Better than other phones without any doubt.\n\nSize: large but awesome build phone and can survive accidental falls too.\n\nYou'll love the usage of iPhone. It's worth it.",

Peculiar problem in covid era is unlocking the phone while you are donning a mask. This phone doesn't unlock by any other method except faceid. I had to type passkey every time i was using mask. Very annoying. Back camera is single. Photos are okay for single camera but not as good as multicamera systems especially in this price segment. iOS is not sooo good to shell out so much chunk when you are getting obsolete design. Storage is big problem. This phone even doesn't allow to backup WhatsApp messages on other cloud services except icloud. And as usual with apple, you have to pay for every bit of service separately when you have already spent so much on the phone. In short this phone is not value for money. Not even close to it. Those who are apple fans are idiots. They are fooled by apple every year. Apple is lacking on innovation for past few years now. They are just fitting new apple chip and new cameras in the same age old design for years and every time increasing the price tag without giving anything so incredible.\nAlso not to forget slow charging speed.\nDON'T BUY THIS PHONE OR ANY IPHONE FOR THAT MATTER IF YOU ARE WISE.",

            "Not up to the mark. Poor battery and build quality. Screen cracked in spite of handling the device gently. And after the sales service from Apple is so so bad",
            "Build: Build quality is absolutely premium. I got the Red version and it looks and feels very good, bit heavy (nearly 200gms.) and it's IP67 water resistant.\n\nPerformance: Performance is very smooth. Don't look at the specs, apple devices doesn't work like that. It can run any intensive tasks pretty easily.\n\nBattery: Battery life is just below exceptional. With my usage( light gaming, listening to music, streaming videos, social media) it gives me 4.5 to 5 hrs screen on time easily. Disappointing thing is apple doesn't provide a fast charger (sold separately and costs 2k). Stand by time is amazing.\n\nCamera: Apple's camera is best for video capturing. Pictures/Selfies are pretty great too. Apple could've included night mode for this device as it's well capable of processing it. No more complaints there.\n\nDisplay: This is the only department this device is underwhelming. It has an IPS LCD display not an Oled/Amoled plus it's under 1080p. If your main concern is media consuming you might consider other options. It can play HDR content(netflix) which is great. Display is good but not great.\n\nSound: This is the segment which has impressed me the most. It has stereo speakers which is not only loud but pretty accurate. I watch lots of shows and I am blown away with sound effects in different scenarios(empty rooms, distant speech, gunshot etc.). Headphones output is excellent, I think it has DAC. The apple headphones in the box is average. I have 3.5 mm headphones, had to buy lightning to 3.5mm adapter for Rs. 900. (not a typo, I know.).\n\nOS: Learn about iOS if you are coming from Android, like me. iOS is not very flexible like Android but more secure and looks more polished. Power users like me got a little disappointed by the limitation iOS has.\n\nOverall this is my first Apple device and I am very pleased with it. If you want to use iPhone this device is a very good start. Got this for 35k which is a good deal imo.",

Battery (7hrs screen on time) i.e all day battery life\n2. Face ID is super fast and 100% secure\n3. Speakers and EarPods are excellent\n4. I already update the latest version iOS 14.2 are excellent\n5. Camera and image quality is great\n6. iCloud only 5gb\n\nCons:\n1. Phone is heavy... 194 grams\n2. Battery charging is slow (5w charger). Default charger take around 3 hrs to full charge\n3. Wireless charging pad upto 4 hrs to full charge",

Performance is spot on super fast buttery smooth phone front camera could have been a be a bit better though and the one big con about this phone is that u don\u2019t get a fingerprint scanner and face unlock doesn\u2019t work with face mask on.

            "No second thoughts about iPhone. Its a beautiful phone...\n- Its wonderfully built, same form factor as the iPhone 11.\n- Very good feel in your hand.\n- Battery backup is not very good.\n- The phone supports 15 Watts fast Charging but the charger provided with the phone is only 5 Watt charger.\n- You cannot use any charger to charge the phone, you must use the charger provided in the box or the ones specifically designed for Apple. Alternatively, you can use any USB source to charge the Phone, but at a very less speed.\n- Pictures come good, but there is lot of noise when you zoom in, selfie camera is average.\n- Display and Sound are awesome\n- If you have been an android user all this while, it will take a lot of time for you to get used to it.\nOverall a good buy.\n\nAbout Delivery:\n- The Delivery is spot on and on time\n- The packaging is bad, it was not kept in another Flipkart box, it was in a cover.\n- No Seal on the i Phone Box, i was told by the Wishmaster that there are no seals on iPhone Box. However, there was no issue in the contents of the package.\n- This was an 'Open Box Delivery'",

I would just mention some categorical features which distinguish this from other iPhone and android devices.\n\na. Battery life, this has the best battery ever on an iPhone. I can literally use it all day and it won't die.\n\nb. Display: I've heard a lot about it being 720p, so 2014-15ish but trust me the display is gorgeous. You would have to nitpick flaws in it and unless you are already using an OLED phone you won't notice the difference.\n\nc. Performance: Though its 2 year old now but the A12 Bionic still packs punches and can beat any qualcomm flagship even today.\n\nApart from these, you would also love the haptic engine. Those subtle vibrations can only be experienced and no android comes even closer to that feel.",

You guys have more or less better gadget.\n2) If you are an android user and planning to buy premium phone. I will suggest them to please buy iPhone instead of buying an Android. I bet you will never go back to android after using IOS.\n\nNow I want to share my 09 days experience with iPhone 11.\n1) Battery backup is 19 hours as I used it for 1 week.\n2) Mind blowing Camera. Best is slow motion.\n3) Very Handy. And look premium. If you have huge money then please go for Pro max.\n4) Display is more or less good. Worth it because it is not Premium display and you are not paying for 11 Pro max.\n5) You will love the sound when your phone is ringing.\n6) Front camera is awesome and must try slow motion selfie.

            "So, guys here is the detailed review you are looking to go over.\n\nThe iPhone XR features a precision-machined 7000 Series aerospace-grade aluminum frame that wraps around an all-glass enclosure with the same durable glass used in the more expensive iPhone XS. Apple designed the iPhone XR in six colors: white, black, blue, coral, yellow, and (PRODUCT)RED.\n\nWith the glass body, Qi-based wireless charging is supported, and the device features IP67 water resistance for keeping it safe from splashes and spills. iPhone XR features a larger display than the previous-generation iPhone 8 Plus, but in a smaller body that falls between the 5.8-inch iPhone XS and the 6.5-inch iPhone XS Max it was introduced alongside.\n\nApple designed a new \"Liquid Retina\" display for the iPhone XR, which is a 6.1-inch LCD with a 1792 x 828 resolution that spans from edge-to-edge and top to bottom with minimal bezels. As with the iPhone XS, there is no Home button on the iPhone XR and it adopts the swipe-based navigation system introduced in the iPhone X.\n\nApple called the Liquid Retina display the most advanced LCD ever in a smartphone with support for 120Hz touch sensing, Tap to Wake, and wide color. It supports True Tone to match the white balance of the display to the ambient lighting in the room, and Apple says it has impressive color accuracy.\n\nThe LCD does not support 3D Touch, but Apple introduced a new Haptic Touch feature to provide haptic responses to certain gestures on the device as a replacement.\n\nInstead of Touch ID, the iPhone XR uses the same TrueDepth camera system that's in the iPhone XS with faster, more efficient Face ID facial recognition for unlocking your device, making Apple Pay payments, and more.\n\nInside, the iPhone XR is sporting a 7-nanometer A12 Bionic chip that includes two-performance cores 15 percent faster than the A11 and four efficiency cores up to 50 percent more efficient. The four-core GPU in the A12 is up to 50 percent faster than the A11.\n\nAn 8-core Neural Engine completes up to 5 trillion operations per second for major improvements to all apps and features that use AR and machine learning. iPhone XR does not use a dual-lens camera system like in the iPhone XS or iPhone 11, instead adopting a single-lens rear camera, but Apple has made software advances to make it nearly as functional as the dual-lens camera in the more expensive iPhone XS models.\n\nIt features an f/1.8 12-megapixel wide-angle lens with a 32 percent larger sensor for sharper, more detailed pictures in low light, which is in fact the same wide-angle camera used in the iPhone XS. The camera supports optical image stabilization, improved True Tone Flash, and it has twice as many focus pixels.\n\nThrough software, Apple enabled Portrait Mode in the iPhone XR, a feature previously limited to dual-lens cameras. Portrait Mode allows users to take DSLR-quality images with artful background blur that focuses the image on the subject of the photo. Advanced bokeh for better blur and Depth Control have also been introduced, allowing for the depth of field of a photo to be adjusted after it's captured.\n\nSmart HDR brings out more detail in highlights and shadows even in situations where lighting conditions are poor, and wide color support results in rich, colorful photographs.\n\nAt the front, the 7-megapixel TrueDepth camera enables all of the features that are available in the more expensive iPhone XS, including Portrait Mode, Portrait Lighting, Depth Control, and more, for what Apple says are the \"best selfies you've ever taken.\"\n\nWhen it comes to battery life, the iPhone XR had the longest battery life of any Apple iPhone at the time of its introduction, although that's no longer the case with significant increases in battery life for Apple's 2019 iPhone lineup. The battery in the iPhone XR does, however, last for an hour and a half longer than the iPhone 8 Plus, offering 25 hours of talk time or 15 hours of internet use.\n\nOther iPhone XR features include dual-SIM support with one nano-SIM and one eSIM, Apple Pay, LTE Advanced with 2x2 MIMO, support for 25+ LTE bands, and Bluetooth 5.0.\n\nBy Einsstark (Google it)",

            "I am using iPhone XR 64gb variant for 2 days. I have used android for 7 years and later moved to iOS. so let me provide a basic and complete review.\nPros:\n1. UI and Basics: The first impression to use ios is just look and design. Users can easily swipe left right and do normal things which can do in real life like notifications, wifi, Bluetooth, brightness, etc. very easily.\n2. IMessage and Facetime: I am totally impressed with this feature. any iPhone user can send a message without any internet and not just message, emojis, photos, videos, a digital message with amazing graphics which looks amazing.\n3. Camera: I have used a camera for different angles and daylight photography is amazing.\n4. Battery: I did not face any issue with battery life. I have used for 4-5 hours of screen time but it performs average as an android phone.\n5. Notifications: Every time when I installed any application, it is asking for a show notification or not. This is the best feature that I found. It will always stay away from me from unusual apps notifications.\n\nCons:\n1. Charging: It comes with a 5w charger and it can a little bit slower than the usual charger.\n2. Low light camera: Image quality is not good in the night or low light camera.\n3. Space issues: If you are a hard-coded gamer and also photoholic then go for 128 GB. else you need to backup every time on the cloud.\n\nThis is a genuine review for the iPhone xr. Overall it is a very good build quality phone. For anyone who wants to use iOS then it is the best option to experience.",

            "Met all of my expectations...Overall nice package at the deal of 45K...Not having telephoto lens in camera setup does not let you compromise in portrait photos. The color reproduction is really good and impressive as always in iPhones. Battery life is far more better than X and XS. Only one think that you will notice is the difference in display. Don't get me wrong its a best IPS panel that Apple have used but cannot beat OLEDs. If you are upgrading from 7 or 8 then you will see no difference in the display. Moreover if we talk about performance there is no doubt as its iOS. It handles heavy games with maximum graphic settings very smoothly and hardly you will see the frame drops. All you need to concern is at what price you are getting XR otherwise buying 2 year old iPhone will not regret you.",

Used HTC premium before the phone known for their elegant looks and touch & iphone XR fulfilled that magic Touch and style. Coral colour looks very astonishing and attractive. Battery life with approx 3000 mAh is much higher than android phones. Camera with Just 12/7 mp can easily best any 64 MP camera of other phones. Only issue with the phone is limited connectivity as unable to Connect (hotspot)with my MI TV. A buy recommendation for budget of 40000.\nios 14 is very intuitive and easy to use.",

Well, you can use an eSim as your second sim, but it's not the same. You can't choose which sim you're gonna call from right before the call, like I used to do in my Redmi. You have to assign separate sims for calling and messaging for each contacts, or it'll simply use the last used sim. And to change it is a bit of a tedious process, after so long with my convenient, cheap, Redmi. Also, there's no option for fingerprint. Well, the face ID works well and good, but that's available in my Redmi as well. Also, Face ID doesn't work with Masks on, people. So maybe postpone buying this till Corona subsides. xD But yeah. It's an iPhone.",

Performance is still to date is powerful enough to run for another 3 years without any hiccups. Battery is excellent with having only 2942mah & gives me somewhat around 9-10hrs of SOT with moderate usage & casual gaming, feels like using a 5000mah battery & can easily go for 2days. The biggest con is the weight. This phone feels heavy while holding. Man my hands starts to ache while holding the phone for more than 15mins until I start to twist my wrist time & again. Moving from iPhone 6 to XR is giving me quite a hit. Other than that Camera is still good for me & takes amazing quality pics in good lighting condition, still not better than the Pixel 3A in Low Light.\nStill this phone is better to go for rather than going for iPhone SE 2020.",

Premium and Unique.\n\nYou see moto x style in those days was a motorola flagship which was owned directly by Google. It was what Google thought was the best for its premium customers. Iphone xr though certainly isn't the best from Apple. But it certainly handles that feeling aptly.\n\nJust hold the phone without even unlocking it and you somehow feel you are on a way of experiencing something premium, magically.\n\nAnd then there comes the software experience. Honestly, it makes you lazy. Thats because it does those small things for you be it unlocking itself or making emojis or making sure you get the best music experience out there without even touching the equilizer..and you know what, that matters a lot.\n\nSo if you are a person who wants to feel the best feeling you ever had before or maybe for the first time with a phone, try this one for sure.\n\nWhoever said ...\n'if you don't have an iphone; well.. you don't have an iphone.!!.'",

            "Hello Guys\nThis is my XR review in 2020 last phase. Because in October/November the iPhone 12 series may be released. And bad news is that XR will stop their production. 1:: if You are an iphone user and you have a budget of 50k looking for an iphone , this is a super mobile go for it. That\u2019s it.... 2:::Android user\u2019s ready to switch iphone go through the review\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a Category:::::::::::: Camera :: i am used lots of brands in android segment. When we compare with android phones, iPhone pictures are simply superb, sharp, accurate, noise free , natural colours. Videos while recording from iphone are very great \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc Battery:::: minimum 6-61/2 screen time will come upto 20% Battery. Only drawback , there is no fast charger and FYI after 86% of battery every iphone charges at 5W/ hr This is not comfortable for some people.\nPerformance:::: simply superb no words to say UI:: This is the most important point for android users because no one tells a clear opinion about iOS. There is lots of sacrifice we have to do in terms of customisation options like ringtone, dual apps, privacy folder options,so be ready for those. LAST WORDS TO SAY:: if you want to switch android to iOS not bother about customised UI, simplygo with XR best in class and best in budget under 50k Thank you \ud83d\ude0a",

This phone will easily get software updates till 2023. Camera is also great. The Liquid Retina Display, although an LCD, still looks great. Color accuracy is commendable. The battery life on this phone is great, lasts 10-12hrs easily. I recommend to charge it with an iPad 12W Power Adapter, since the charger provided in the box is very slow.",

So decided to go with the apple and honestly the feel which apple gives u no where comparable with android with its Liquid Retina HD display ! Excellent performance and the IOS made me feel the originality of using the apps. Superb design and about the cam u get perfect shot with more camera options like portrait mode with advanced bokeh and Depth Control and video with 4k recording which is really amazing!\nFaceID: Never worry when u are in dark place!! u can unlock the device with even 0% of brightness which is awesome! Coming to the battery it is more Mhz compared to the previous models! Last but not least the speakers gives u Wider stereo playback. About the EarPods with Lightning Connector!\nu can't get the quality of the sound in costly earphones which u get for android !Trust me its really worth for the amount u pay. Only disadvantage is that the charger which is damn slow comes with the device even u can go for the fast charging which is sold separately.\nI'm really happy with my Iphone Xr!\nI give One star less only because of flipkart services ! Yes they delayed almost 1 month to deliver my location..",

If you r planing to purchase under 50k price segment ,then definitely u can purchase it.\nPUBG review- I played on 100% to 40% smooth- extreme in between 3 to 3:30 hours.\nNo lag, no bugs, no glitches,no frame drop\nTouch response is god level.\nCamera- I wouldn\u2019t say a single word about dis bec u can go for google or YouTube to compare any other device.\nLooks- damn sexy for both boys and girls (any colour)\nI recommend to those who will purchase it please don\u2019t drain your battery too much .\nDon\u2019t play games or high graphics anything 5-25 % charge (it will effective in any other device such as android also)\nNever drop down to 10-5% charge\nCharge it between 20-30% if you will use it for a long term, your battery capacity is to be good\n\nSound-fabulous 10/10\nHeadphones quality wire quality is not that much good but it\u2019s sound quality is like fire . You can easily compare with akg headphones and jbl. Both headphones I used . But apple gives you the clarity ,just awesome\nWater resistant- apple say it\u2019s water resistant but care of your mobile as you care like non water resistant mobile because apple would\u2019t give you any warranty on water damage. So be careful. It\u2019s expensive so don\u2019t do that.\nThank you ekart ,for your lovely delivery\n\nIf this review is helpful for you then hits the like button \ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffb\n#jaihind\n#jaibaharat",
