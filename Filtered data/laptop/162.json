            "An affordable beast !\nPros:\n1. Incredible performance, will average minimum of 60FPS on any game (except cyberpunk) at maximum settings at 1080P, even in games with ray tracing.\n2. Display is very good, high refresh rate makes everything better\n3. Fans are good at keeping temps down\n4. Trackpad and keyboard are good\nCons:\n1. When the display shows something totally black, like in a loading screen, you can see the backlight bleed and prominently observe glowing patches on the screen.\n2. Fans, while effective, are really really loud. Headphones are a must while gaming...\n3. Especially because the speakers are sub par, they're not loud, and neither do they sound good\n4. Even though fans are effective at keeping cpu and GPU temps down, the laptop surface heats up quite a bit and you can feel it.\n5. While 3200 Mhz DDR4 RAM is nice to have, it is running in single channel, can easily gain quite a lot more frames with upgrading ram.\n6. i7 10870-H is still a good cpu and performs well in gaming, can't escape the fact that it's a generation older and is 14nm. Ryzen options are more powerful certainly however this chip is ample for gaming.\n7. Even though the display is excellent, doesn't support HDR. Would have loved HDR on this display.\n8. RGB keyboard is cool but will automatically switch off backlight with 30 seconds of inactivity. Haven't yet found any way to switch off this timer. Very annoying.\n9. The amount of bloatware included in this laptop is truly special.\n10.. Have had lots of experience with Acer and so have many people I know. Acer's track record with reliability and build quality is shocking and I swore to myself never to buy another Acer\n\nAnd yet, for this price, the specs are fantastic and the sheer performance is enough to forget all the issues with the laptop. You're buying this for the RTX 3060, make no mistake about that.",
            "Best laptop in this price segment.. battery is quite bad but the performance is beast... You can play AAA games easily and feel best experience..I'm using this laptop since 2 weeks and I'm happy with it. I'm content creator and 3d animator and I can work easily. Go for it guys this is beast machine. Thank you acer for this product and flipkart for the best deal. Render process is super and Best part is Ray tracing you can feel the game.",
            "To be honest\nPro's 1) RGB keyboard\n2)144Hzs with 3ms\n3)Rtx 3060 with 6gb\n4)8 cores 16 Threads\nCon's\n1)it is not value for money like \"if predator comes with ryzen 7 5000 series it definitely a Beast now it is 8 cores 16 Threads in Intel not even beats the ryzen 7 4000series\".\n2)near top of keyboard there is a huge heating issue.definately need to buy cooling pad\n3)base frequency is 2.25Ghz which is the most important and disadvantage in this laptop\nSo guys please think twice before buying this laptop",
            "* Performance nd build quality is good\n* display quality superb\n* rtx 3060 great performance in this price range\n\ud83d\udeabbut there are some software bugs\nmay be they will fix the bugs in further updates\n\u2705Overall in this price range this is best opportunity for\nWho want to buy a new gaming laptop in2021",
            "So i wanted a decent Gaming Laptop with Good specs. Then i found this beast having allround top specs :\n\nPros:\n1. Built and Design : It is a well built laptop No complaints. Design is great too\n2. Display : The 144hz display is Amazing Colours are so good.\n3. Fans : The Fans are amazing . They keep the laptop cool whenever the temp rises.(One of the point which made me buy this laptop)\n4. Performance : Only one word INCREDIBLE will give easily 60+FPS at ultra in most of the games.\n5 HDD and SSD : The HDD is fast since its 7200RPm and 256 GB SSD boots the laptop very fast. I would have loved it even more if they gave us 512GB SSD instead of 256 GB\nSSD\n\nI know this cant be a pros for everyone but for me it is\n\n1. The Booting animation and the sound . I Just loved it. It gives a feel that we own a Gaming device .\n\nCons:\n1. The speakers sound output is very low. My previous lenovo laptop had JBL speakers so i know what i am missing.\n2. Though fans are effective but they are loud and we need a headphone to listen to the sound\n3. The CPU is a generation older and its 14nm. Thought it works really well and is enough for gaming.\n\nThese are the cons which we can improve with Upgrades:\n\n1. Ram is single channel so if we add one more stick then we can get better frames easily.\n\nGames i have tested : (Remember we can get better framerates if we add one more stick) and i have updated rtx 3060 TGP to 105 w from an update\n\n1. Overwatch : 125-130 in ultra\n2. Shadow of Tom Raider : 62 avg in ultra settings RTX on DLSS On\n3. Red dead Redemption : 59 avg in ultra settings (this game will soon get DLSS and after that we can have FPS boost)\n\n\nOverall i will say that seeing the current situation in the PC and Laptop industry i can say this is a BEAST at this price point. Its a must buy for all gamers out there",
            "The Laptop is a masterpiece with stunnig design and premium looks.\nThe packing is awesome with a case to store it. The keyboard is customizable to different RGB colors via the Predator sense application.\n\nThe fan is quite loud when turbo mode is turned on.\nThe screen brightness levels are extreme. You can easily have a great experience even while using it outdoors.",
            "1) display ips panel major drawback, when viewing in black screen mild colour changes occurs but when viewing in different angles it will change, if it changes then its said as ips glow which is default drawback comes with ips panel, if the colour does not change on viewing in different angles then its backlight bleed, then its considered as defect\n2)16 gb ram ddr4, 2933mhz, cl21 is given\n3)gaming tested with games like cyperpunk2077, resident evil8, and red dead redemption 2,good performance,tested for continous 3 hours gameplay, but laptop heatsup a lot while gaming but its normal for gaming, if turbo mode is on it causes more fan sound\n4)8 cores and 16 threads are given in cpu\n5)there were some software bugs like windows update screen quality issue and onedrive cannot be signed in, which are all corrected by updating windows\n6)battery drains faster when on heavy usage , battery capacity could have been better\nOverall a good product except ips panel glow drawback everything is fine, that too when normal screen appears cannot be identified.",
            "This is beast \u26a1\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f and value for money\nBattery backup is good but this is gaming laptop so dont think about battery too much\nFlipkart\u2019s delivery was great on time",
            "It feels very premium as-\nFull metal (Aluminum) body.\nDiamond cut edges\nBacklit logo\n\nAverage of 90 fps in Haven benchmark.\nWorks well with heavy apps (IDK about gaming) such as Unity engine, Unreal engine, Visual Studio 2019, Photoshop, etc.\n\nIf you want more fps just want more fps add one more stick of 16gb, I know 16gb in 2021 is enough but it is in single channel means only 1 * 16 and not 2 * 8.\nMany people it as a con but it is a pro for it as when we need to upgrade it we won't need to waste money.\n\nIt opens heavy projects (10gb - 20gb) in under a minute.\n\nAs most of you are concerned, on a day with 40\u00b0C in India, without fans at max it reached 97\u00b0C but did not shutdown (in almost full load), but thanks to it powerful fans it did not reach more than 75\u00b0C for the processor while the GPU never heats.\n\nMax fan speed processor- 5000 rpm\nMax fan speed graphics card-6000rpm\n\nYou might think that the sad will reach 8gb/s then you are wrong, it works fine like it boots up in 15 sec and everything is just fine but it works upto 500mb/s. It is not the fault of the laptop it is with every ssd, it will reach 8gb/s only when you are open 100's of gbs of files and the app can handle it.\n\nThe display is great and very bright, thanks to it's ips display it is never gonna hurt your eyes. Moving from 60hz to 144hz will make you feel like your windows was lagging earlier.\n1440p is definitely better than 1080p but it just go and set screen size to 100 instead of 125 then it is great.\n\nThe overall performance along with the temperature according to the task we are doing is great, smooth like butter.\n\nThe processor reaches upto 4.3Ghz on all 8 cores and supports multithreading. It is an i7 10870H (not overclockable).\n\nThe GPU reaches up 2100mhz with 105W in turbo mode in predator sense, the information can be found on nvidia's website.\n\nThe laptop is quite upgradeable too, 2 more ssds, 1 more hdds, one more ram slot.\n\nThere is a lot too tell about it's awesome predator sense, it gives you full control of your laptop unlike hp who keeps everything locked.\nThe BIOS is pretty good too and easy.",
            "Best laptop with great discount and offers . Flawless processor , awesome display and stylish body , which looks premium. Graphic card RTX 3060 is great for seamless gaming and graphic experience.I was searching a decent gaming laptop and choose this over MSI due to being loyal to Acer and better service network than MSI . I upgraded my I3 3rd gen to this laptop . RGB keyboard is cool but fans are bit loud and noisy however effective to keep cool .\nNot a bad deal , indeed .",
            "The product is good and nice quality.Got it at a good price\nReview after 6 months of usage:\nLaptop have no issue high fps games need to be careful in the temperature aspects, like buying a laptop stand would help it a bit.\nAlso, serviced my laptop at an official acer service centre loved the support.\nUntill now i have just one complain which is regarding HDD which got corrupted for me randomly but got it replaced for free just lost the data. \ud83d\ude2d Can improve this by using WD drives instead of seagate..\nOther than that i highly recommend this laptop for gaming and workspace",
            "Good laptop but customer care folks are real disappointment, as no information was given regarding Accidental Damage Protection which comes complementary with warranty extension if purchased within 7 day of invoice date and if missed cannot be covered. On the 7th day, I reached out to them but they didn't want to help, they said base warranty registration has not been done (for which no intimation was received neither any software directed for the same post first boot) and now it will take 48 hours and till that time 7th day condition would be missed for ADP to be applied in the offer and they shut the call. Later I anyway went and purchased ADP+2yrs warranty extension on Acer website and asked them to tag it to my laptop serial number. Clear they could have helped but refrained from doing the same. Timely delivery by Flipkart.",
            "This is my first review ever. Value for money product. Good display except for the light screenbleeding issue but the colour accuracy makes up for it .\nRendering in Adobe premier pro is quick without much of a framedrops, 90fps average while playing Forza Horizon 4 in ultra settings. So Gpu is great, thanks to RTX 3060.\nI7 10870h gives a decent Cpu performance. There is no overheating as such. Overall a decent package for content creators and game lovers.",
            "It has been 3 weeks since getting this thing but gotta say it's served well so far.. Except the obvious average battery but that's to be expected from a gaming laptop and almost no audibility from the speakers. The display is good, the keyboard with the rgb is good and it's not too heavy to carry around. The design is simple yet stylish I would say and the performance is good. Also, I learned that you could get a lot of performance improvement from running dual channel ram.. Wish it were dual to be honest. All in all, a very good laptop if you could ignore the sound and battery thing",
            "Great laptop just as per specification.Battery usage is around max 4 hours if you are not gaming. Performance wise is a beast just after reading about processor ranking i think i should have gone with predator i7 11850 model. Overall though great model. Flipkart follow up after delivery and mode of delivery was great too. Buy it if you want to spend 13k less than for predator i7 11850 model.This model has 256 ssd pre-installed too but i would recommend 11850 model comparatively overall thank you flipkart! !",
            "I got it at 107k around a month ago. I have played multiple games during this time, all of them in high/extreme settings and have not faced any issues. The display is also great. The weight of the laptop is not much and is very easy to carry. The speaker sound is not high enough. The turbo mode is enough to cool down your pc when its temperature is high(very rare temp rise).",
            "Awesome value for money. Feels solid. The ports are a bit tight, but I guess it might get better with use. Haven't gone anywhere it's limits yet...don't think I ever will. Overall good product feel and very satisfying buy.\nHad it for a week. Power backup is around 5 hrs @ \"Better battery\" settings. HUGE power brick.",
            "If you want to do heavy tasks like video editing, design work, play heavy games... Do consider adding another 8/16 gb ram to make it dual channel... The performance will be significantly better.\nThere are many detailed reviews in this review section which i also agree with so you can refer to those.\nOther than this... It's perfection for the price range(Rs. 1.14 lakh)",
            "A great performing laptop, the 110W RTX 3060 GPU performs really well and easily outputs more than 60fps at 1080p at max settings. The i7 10850H is a perfect companion for gaming. The laptop has decent overclocking headroom and the thermals are pretty good with vents at the bottom for intake. A cooling pad will keep it even cooler.",
            "Overall very good price to performance ratio.\nWith upgrades like RAM and a SSD, the laptop would be even better - has extra empty slots for the same.\nDoesn't heat up much while gaming. Sound is average.\nPro Tip : Uninstall Nvidia Drivers and reinstall them through System Updates, significantly increases fps in games.\nDefinitely Recommended for anyone looking for a value for money laptop.",
            "Guys, this is a good laptop for mid range gamers and good for editors. But I recommend you to buy a laptop with 1 TB SSD because this laptop has the worst hdd . It's Ssd is really good but hdd is really slow. Also the nvidia sticker is a little bit tilted which makes it kinda uncomfortable to look at it.\nPros and Cons\n1 RTX 3060 is beast especially when you Install game or editing application in SSD. Adobe premiere pro runs very smoothly and efficiently . After effects however runs smoothly but render time is still high and you need to keep turbo fan mode on.\n\n2 . SSD is super fast. HDD is okay in terms of copying a file. Installing a high end game from fitgirl takes very less time in SSD . I installed Just Cause 4 (50 gb) game and it took only 45 minutes to install.\n\n3.Cooling is awesome when editing and gaming. However in ultra high settings cooling cannot hold very much longer and charger also gets very heated. I was able to play Call of Duty Black Ops 3 (123 gb) very well but heating is problem . It may be because I installed in HDD so that's why I mentioned earlier that big size games can only be played in SSD smoothly .\n\n4. The best part is the Design and looks. You will get a premium feel keeping this laptop with you and also the RGB keyboard has 4 zones and with multiple modes. You can choose between 8 colors in 4 key keyboard region.\n\n5. Startup is superfast and Refresh rate is awesome.\n\n6. Worst thing about this laptop is even though it's i7 8 cores you will not get 5 ghz speed at all. You will only get 4 ghz max speed and that too the laptop starts to lag a little bit. I noticed this while rendering an after effects project.\nAlso there are 8 cores so change the description and make it accurate.\n\n7. Multi-tasking is awesome while programming , watching Netflix and keeping classes on at the same time with many tabs open .\n\n8. Camera is good and speakers is loud enough to hear.\nIt's a metallic body, so fingerprints can be seen very easily as compared to other laptops. Make sure you clean them everyday.\n\n9. Brightness is really good. I keep at only half because it's bright enough for all purposes.\n\nI am uploading all the images related to the comments above mentioned .",
            "This laptop is a beast. I can play almost all AAA games with high/ultra settings with DLSS. Display is great for this price range. I added another memory stick to unlock its full potential. Storage expansion is future poof as it has got 2 m2 ssd slots with Sata slot as well. With Intel and Nvidia promotions running I got Watch Dogs Legion and Marvels Guardians of Galaxy free. So I bought this for 1 lakh plus these 2 game bundle made my purchase exceptional.",
            "I hade bought this product a month ago and I used to do both gaiming and editing in this product an I am vlwell stisfide with the perfomence and the cooling system is great and it gives a great out put\nCons\nTrack pad is not so good need a extr mouse\nAnd the blutooth connectivity is not up to the expectations",
            "nice gaming laptop. Handles multitasking smoothly as for as gaming is concerned high end gaming like assasins creed gives juice for 20minutes after that the game starts to shake a little bit and becomes slow . Battery power is good for day to day browsing , mine gives roughly 2 hrs for browsing and other normal use. Sound is not upto the DTS mark u need headset or an external speaker to get the desired sound. If you are hardcore gamer then it won't fulfill ur need. Wireless connectivity is great in this laptop. Price of this unit does not satisfy the expectations that comes with it",
            "I am not a pro gamer, I used this laptop for deep learning and heavy computing,it work like a pro and very smooth in installing anything ,fast startup and very smooth while using.\nJust compare it configuration and price in market. Will suggest you to go for without a doubt",
            "Bought it while it was on sale at Flipkart \u263a\ufe0f.\nFortunately it was delivered without any defects and damages. Got delivered in 6 days.\nThis Laptop is an absolute beast, it has GTX 3060 graphics and most importantly 8 core variant of the 10th gen core i7. If this had 6 core variant of the i7 i wouldn't have even considered this laptop.\n\nAs for the cooling, i play tekken 7 at ULTRA seetings, after 30 mins it does get hot. But once you close the game it just cools down FAST in like 8 mins.\n\nI have been using this laptop for more than a week now and im really glad and happy that i made this purchase.\n\nTHANK YOU FLIPKART!!\u2764\ufe0f",

            "It's an amazing Laptop.. Although louder speaker would have been even better and I was expecting all software would have atlist 1 year license upon buying... But it's not like that... Ms office and few other software needs to be bought to use even though they are installed.. Apart from all this I love it's design and other features.. I would recommend this to game lovers out there.. If they can over look the above mentioned cons.",
            "Best 3060 laptop of this price range. Only better laptop with a 3060 would be the Lenovo Legion 5, which is consequently also quite a bit more expensive(1L on discount vs 1.3L). 105w TDP is only lower than the aforementioned Legion 5 which has 130w TDP. HDD is 7200 so not slow at all and loads every game pretty quickly, and it has two slots for M.2 SSDs as well, although we cant upgrade it ourselves due to warranty seal.\n\nIn terms of actual perfs, the GPU works like a charm and gives 60 FPS min on high-ultra settings in recent games like Halo Infinite (FPS drops to around 50 in some open world segments but that is just poor optimization at the game's end). CPU gets unreasonably hot (10 degrees over the GPU temps) but this can be remedied using Undervolting which works with BIOS version 2.02 but I'm not sure about other versions.\n\nRAM is single channel but you can get additional 8GB 3200 MHz RAM for around 2.5-3k and add it to get a performance boost (Or additional 16 GB if you wish but its not really necessary)\n\nAnother alternative in close to this price range would be the MSI laptop with AMD RX 6600m but AMD isn't really known for having good software support so you may end up wasting a lot of time trying to figure out driver issues for each game.",
            "The laptop is exceptionally fast and boots instantly because of SSD. The screen has good colour vibrancy and trackpad is precise. Liked number of ports on offer, especially Ethernet port, which is now becoming extinct. The 8 core cpu is added plus. Not yet used for gaming, so can't comment on that aspect. But it assures me that it will pull any application, which ever I throw at it.",
            "Performance is good ,but battery is very poor in even if you do normal work like attend meetings surf internet ,you will get backup of just 1hr 30 to 45 min ,if your priorities is battery please go with other brands ,other than this I'm getting good fps in all games.",
            "A great value for money product!\nGreat processors, gpu - most games run at ultra settings with 60+ fps. Note - rtx 3060 is the lowest powered gpu in the 30xx series(better go for 2070 for more power)\nHeats fast, but good cooling - specially the availability of turbo mode to overclock the fans and cool down quite fast.\nSound is not the best, but given its a gaming laptop, its better than average.\nAn overall very satisfactory product, as a gamer and programmer, I feel very comfortable with all the specs.",
            "Good purchased given that this is a rare combination of RTX-3060 with CPU i7-10870h . However dont expect a mindboggling performance (2 less stars) because the CPU appears to be underperforming. it is almost on par with my 5 year old Dell. Can play most games at 60 FPS (CyberPunk 2077, Forxa Horizon 4 etc.) Turbo cooler is a good feature. I was expectig better. If you have a fe more cash to spare go for ASUS Strix. Now dont get me wrong, i mean for beginner to medium level gamers this laptop should be good enough . For pros playing tournaments etc you can give this a miss. probably desktop rig is a better option.",
            "Terrific value for money.\nNumber of usbs could have been increased from 3 to 4.\nTemps reach 77 under 100% usage for gpu even though it has massive heat pipes aswell as radiators on both sides and two on back.\nFor cpu under 100% continuous loads it reaches high 80s.\nI would suggest using it in air-conditioned rooms and keeping it raised and or getting a laptop cooler which pushes air towards the chassis since the laptop fans pull from below.\nUsing rtx was an amazing experience for the first time in tomb raider. Loved it overall.\nAlso the new design of the charger port makes it very hard push the plug in, so give it a hard push on the first time. B",
            "Overall nice product...well no changes in design from previous gen but good upgrade in terms of processor (i7 10870H) and graphic (rtx 3060 100w). No lag nothing, display is mind-blowing,handles multiple operations very easily like it's nothing. Will update more after gaming test.",

Only issue found on Day 1 use is the temperatures are hitting 70C - 75 on tasks requiring 3.5-4 Ghz clock speed on auto fan settings, not sure if this is normal. The top vent near keyboards is always hot. I have connected my laptop to 2K 144Hz monitor\nsetup maybe that's why the temperature but its also sitting on a cooling pad. Will test the laptop individually and play with fan settings and update in few days.",

            "Build quality is good just a little battery issue but still can play upto 2 3 hrs. Has metal build so it doesn\u2019t get overheat but keep it on hard surface value of money",

            "Best products in world",
            "Nothing great, its okay product. Performance is good..Display is not up to the mark and audio is worst than mobile speakers. Battery is 2-3 hrs and heats alot while doing any graphics work. Expected a better product for the price",
            "Nice product.. we need to talk about cons...!!!\n\n1. Electricity leak over metal body on touchpad area\n2. Screen bleeding ( within a week ).\n3. lowest battery life ever in my usage...!!",
            "Very thing is awesome for now and it's a good product that u can buy a beast\ud83d\udd25",
            "Considering period of the pandemic, I am very happy and surprised with flipkart's service. Delivered in 4 days to my very small distant town and packing was also good. About the LAPTOP, comes with cpu i7-10870h which is octa core and amazing gpu rtx 3060. The combination is very good for high end games. It can run Cyberpunk 2077 in high settings without much issue(in ultra settings glitches a lot). I could run RDR 2 in ultra settings with around 40-70 fps. Heat management is okay. I will say if you are tired of waiting for ryzen 7 5800h laptops to come out, go for this laptop.",
            "Took them 11 days to deliver.\nBuild quality is mediocre.\nGPU gets hot even in low load. GPU power doesn't go beyond 30W\nDisplay is perfect.",
            "Amazing Purchase and Value for money",
            "Finally my problem solved",
            "Except Battery Product is good on design and performance rtx 3060 is working well no issues So fast changing so much battery drain maximum only 3hrs of battery life",
            "Is this I a beast for gaming but the only problem I am facing is thermal thothel",
            "Just go for it!",
            "Performance is great as expected, goes with the name.",
            "awesome",
            "Looks and performance wise superb!\nCost wise, not worth it. Bought it for 1L but Legion has superior clock speed processor in same price.\nThe keyboard has very close keys. Handrest at left hand side is small.\n\nGood buy if you are a gamer, bad buy for other purposes, considering its quite heavy too.",
            "Amazing design buy acer\nBuild quality is good\nFlipkart delivery is very fast\nCamera quality is good",
            "The laptop is amazing. You can later upgrade it to 32 gb ram. It will provide you mind-blowing performance. You can also later go to Acer service centre and apply thermal paste. You will be satisfied with this purchase",
            "It is really a beast. Everything is superfine except its heat dissipation system. In hot weather and hot days it becomes more hot without max fan mode on. Audio system is not upto the mark. Also after updating to Windows 11, its booting time is also increased which is a problem of Windows 11 with SSDs. TBH, my overall work performance is the best with this beast.",
            "Very good.",

            "Absolute beast of a laptop at this price range",
            "Just awesome The performance is peak yes it has a little heating issue just switch on the turbo mode and done you can game for long and the fan noise is a bit loud use headphones",

            "Poor sound quality",
            "The laptop is really the best in this segment of price. I got it in 97000 in big billion days sale 2021. The design, the display, the performance is really mind-blowing. Only the thing is you can use around 3 to 3:30 hours on a single charge. But after all this is performance laptop and you cannot expect long battery life from it.",
            "This laptop is very fast and stunning smooth like a batter and color aquracy of display is awesome.,if you are looking for editing and architecture then go for it this laptop is full fill your need as per required \ud83d\ude00",
            "Value for money i can say ...\n\nThere is temp issue if you are using cool pad no problem at all.\n\nPerformance was good i can stream heavy games on multiple platform . If they provide dual channel Ram (8+8) the performance of laptop may increase.\n\nOverall build quality, performance, 144hz screen was give you amazing gaming experience.",
            "Good laptop for gaming..",
            "Definitely go for it worth every penny",
            "just bought it on big billion days in great discounted price, and it's awesome....laptop working perfect no doubt came as it is model..no issue.",
            "ATTENTION!\nDON'T BUY WITHOUT READING THIS.\n\n\nThis laptop is good but this has one serious problem, nothing deal-breaking but very substantial. The laptop comes severely bottlenecks out of the box (GPU bottleneck because of single-channel ram), basically the laptop runs 50 to 70% slower in CPU-intensive games/tasks due to which GPU utilization only goes to 30 to 50%. This is because this laptop only has 1 single 16GB ram(single channel), you need two rams of the same size and same speed in dual-channel to get the true performance of this machine. Otherwise, the laptop is 70% slower. In Apex legends I was getting 80 to 110 fps on the lowest settings (before adding ram), after adding another ram in the dual-channel I am now getting 190to 280fps.",
            "Amazing Machine. Total Value for money. Top class built and performance. Go for it whiteout a doubt...got it during the BBD sale.",

            "Good value for money",
            "Awesome speed with CAD software, attractive keyboard, good speakers. It arrived 2hrs later than expected. Yet haven't tried with games. Care to be taken while plugging USB devices (plug gently). I bought Logitech wireless Comfort MK345 Keyboard which comes with mouse. They gell well with the Predator shape and blue theme",
            "Great product, A++ seller",
            "Good",
            "This is a beast. It can run anything you throw at it.\n\nA bit on the heavy end, especially the charger, but the laptop is a damn eye candy",
            "Great product",
            "Good",
            "Its great and unmatched performance",
            "Attracts fingerprints and dust alot, needs frequent cleaning. Feels little heavy to carry around. Have only one ram stick 16\u00d71, its better to add another 16gb in the extra ram slot.\nHardware is great.\n\nWhen screen goes off while not in use, it takes 3 to 5 seconds to turn it on. Speaker are not bad, but i use headphones everytime. Software is great. No fingerprint. Keyboard and trackpad are good and responsive.\n\n\nI loved the laptop ( ignoring the cons ).\n\n\u2764\u2764\u2764",

            "This laptop is a beast, and a steal for your money. The combo of rtx 3060 with i710870H is just too powerful. Can run any game at high settings.\nBenchmarks:\n- valorant: I was getting 130+ fps in high settings easily\n-warzone: I was getting 80-100 fps easily in high settings\n-gta online: I was getting 100-110 fps in high and very settings\n\nIn all the games played for 4.5 hours straight, the cpu temp. never went above 75 degree C and the gpu temp. never crossed the 67 mark.\nClearly it can be seen that though it has very powerful gpu cpu, it has good geat management.\n\nBuild quality is very good, with some flex on the lid, but its due to the fact that its made of aluminum. You also get thunderbolt here, which is awsome. The 4 zone rgb gives a really nice touch to it. Booting time is around 14 sec with games apps and drivers installed",
