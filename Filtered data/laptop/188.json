            "I just bought this laptop after exchanging my 10 year old lenovo core i3 in 8300 Rs.\nThe laptop is great though the build quality is not top notch and you can feel it immediately. But very light weight and shows premium looks.\nI have opened numerous multitasking on first day, did some office work and some light poker on adda52 and baazi apps. All worked without a issue.\nAll in all a good laptop for day to day work and light gaming.\nOne more things, the keys are soft and feel delicate so dont hit it like keybord or else I feel it can be damaged in no time.",
            "Processer speed very slow.. booting time high.. design good .. battery backup good.. overall satisfied in this budget.. if u want used it for basic need.. it's good otherwise go for another product ...",
            "Best Budget Laptop. I am very very thankful for flipkart for such a amazing Laptop at this price. Battery performance excellent. Display mind-blowing. Very little and minor issue with performance because of processor but overall very decent Laptop and it's design is just Outstanding.",
            "1. Processor pentium silver N5000 quad core = five star.\n2. Processor speed only = three star (performance a bit slower while installation and larg files).\n3. Screen 15.6\u2019\u2019 HD = five star.\n4. Storage 1TB HDD = five star.\n5. HDD rpm 5400 = four star (just very minute delay in retrieving data).\n6. Full size keyboard = five star. (no indicators like caps lock and num lock)\n7. It seems body is plastic material = four star.\n8. Charger cord length is good 2.5m = five star.\n9. Only windows 10 is preinstalled.\n10. No MS office and others are pre installed.\n11. Taking time 50 to 60 seconds to initialize the computer and also little bit time in every application (can be adjusted in budget laptop).\n12. Found good snip and sketch application for screenshots like paint app.\n13. This laptop serves the basic needs like browsing, word, excel, ppt and pdf applications and etc.\n14. Not suitable for who wants to use heavy applications.\n\nOver all laptop rating is four star.",

Any contribution to China's GDP results in contributing to its defense spending which in turn increases India's defense spending , which finally leads to inflation- you pay more but later, not when buying the laptop.\n2, RAM; win 10 home needs more RAM, 4 may be a bit low for intensive use\n\nHowever if you are a poor student or don't have a high budget but need a laptop, then please go for it. Salaried folks in the 30% tax bracket should not be buying these and causing inflation in the country.\n\n1. Please look up a cnet article 10 things to speed up windows, you will need to do that. Windows has transparency effects which you need to disable for example.\n2. I also turned off a windows process that scans for malware , as it was slowing down the hard disk\n3. I installed the opera browser, as Chrome hogs a log it the RAM. Memory utilization came down to 65% from 75% default when using Opera amd not using chrome or Edge .\n\nYes, the problem is windows 20 - it is bulky and eats up RAM,.

            "First un install macfee and micorsoft 365 office and other unused apps either its very slow. perfect for students.....Perfects for programming... Display is good.... Sound is good... Camra poor.... Battery can not perdict. It can be predicted after 6 months.. Heating no issue as it is new.... For price range 17000 to 22000 its perfect. And its not advisable to purchase costly laptop.if you have less money in pocket then go for it.saving money always good for all. main cost is for processor, RAM, and Disk but this processor behaving poor at different Test conditions. So I will give 5 star at this price range.I hope in future some Indian company can also design and assemble products like this.",
