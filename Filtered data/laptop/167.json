            "Firstly thank you very much flipkart for delivering the product on time. Ordered on 16th july and got delivered today. Product was packed perfectly as well. Now regarding the product:\n\n1. Excellent design, build quality and looks. The shining ROG logo, RGB lighting at bottom and rgb keyboard.\n2. Awsome performance of laptop. Intel core i7 9th gen with 16GB RAM is just mindblowing\n3. GTX 1650 4GB Graphics is just perfect for many new games.\n4. Dual storage ( 1TB HDD firecuda + 256GB SSD ) is awsome and perfect.\n5. Perfect display screen having 120hz display.\n6. Battery is ok. Lasts max 5hrs on light use and 1hr on heavy gaming.\n7. Speakers are also awsome.\n\n\nOverall its an excellant laptop from ASUS and highly recommended for all who planning to buy it.",
            "Overall Rating 4/5. First impression was awesome.good quality packing and good outer finish,even though its plastic its still makes you say wow when you open the box.Main attraction is the lighting in keyboard and on the sides.its simply amazing.battery life is good speed and other features are awesome. charging and hdmi and lan port are at backside of laptop thats a huge plus. Has no webcamera thats a negative and has no cd drive that doesn't matter because we dont use cds now. has a writing speed of average 100mbps thats awesome. and as in advertisement it shows only 4GB Graphics ram but Laptop actually has 8GB Ram [4 GB Nvidia GTx and 4GB Intel HD Graphics] laptop shares both rams so technically this is a 8GB Graphics Ram laptop. Sound system is supported by Dolby and this laptop has excellent Speakers,sound is superb quality. has additional battery modes apart from windows mods to help save battery and increase its life span.Asus center makes the warranty and product registrations easier. along with this laptop you will be getting 11,000 Rupees worth Games/Softwares for free as a part of promotion from intel.best laptop you can get at this price range.if you are looking for a affordable gaming laptop then this is your best choice.",
            "It is a very nice laptop with best performance and display quality is also a plus point and RGB lighting is also good.\nonly 2 Drawbacks are there...\n1) No Camera\n2) No Type C port and also right side numberpad on keyboard\nbut if u want it for performance then it is Beast..also have16gb DDR4 Ram Which is so fast..\nalso there is no storage problem 1Tb HDD..and 256 SSD (in which windows are installed and also which is very much faster)... i will say it is a must buy laptop if you are planning to buy it at this price..i purchased it during Big Billion Days at cost of 69990-/rs only..So i am very Much Happy With it......",
            "2 Month Review : The specs are i7 9th gen combined with a 16 GB Single Channel Ram, 256 SSD and 1 TB HDD. Nvidia's GTX 1650 handles almost all the graphic intensive titles pretty well.The base clock of the processor is around 2.7 Ghz and can be turbo boosted around 4.5Ghz,which is pretty much good figure.The laptop performance is absolutely great. I mainly use it for editing purposes (Adobe Premiere CC 2019) and the application works absolutely perfect without any lag or anysort of hang.I have also run games like Assassinscreed Syndicate, Maxpayne 3,GTA V, Forza Horizon 4,FIFA 20 etc, all in ultra settings and there was no frame drop at all.The battery backup is not something that you can rely on a gaming laptop,this laptop gives around 4-5 hours in silent mode and in performance you can get around 2 hours. The main thing I noticed is that the Turbo mode won't turn on until you plug it into a power source and without plugged in you won't be able to achieve the required frame rate in some games like GTA V, Witcher 3 etc. The 120hz display is an absolute bliss. But when you plug in and plug out, the refresh rate automatically lowers to 48hz which is disturbing and to turn it back to 120hz you either have to plug it in or go to display settings and change it back.The thermals are also great in this laptop.After hours of intesive gaming only the portion where the Cpu and Gpu located gets heated up, there is not much heat coming onto the keyboard.The speakers below average.The trackpad is precise, the RGB lighting combined with Armoury Crate is something great to work on and have fun.The built quality is absolutely stunning.There is only minimal(very less) flex of the screen.The keyboard is also fine but after a 2 months usage my \"backspace\" button started to sound a bit different. And for 2-3 times I heard popping sound from the speakers while booting up and it continued and then I had to restart the system, it maybe due to some bug on Sonic Sound Studio Software.i7 9th gen is an absolute beast.It's more than a budget gaming laptop,you can go for it.",
            "Good to buy\nThe specifications are totally worthy .\nexcellent gaming graphics and best FPS\nAlso good for Rendering and 3D MODELLING Software\nthis laptop gives Turbo power when plugged in charger and can enjoy gaming",
            "if u r gamer this laptop is perfect for gaming. current are famous game like hitman2, gta5, mafia3, call of duty advance warfare, etc. play smothly.... negative point~ free game offer, rubbish very poor offer...in high settings fan noise audible... and keypad heated. but these are acceptable, performance like beast, & offer price also good.i bought 74999 in this price range 16gbram, 256 ssd, and also upgradeble.. so do not think more..... like gaming just go for it.this review i submit near of 2 months after purchase",
            "I was not much into the colourful keyboard and the bottom side of the laptop until I got this laptop in my hand and experienced it in real time. the aura sync which is what asus calls the Rgb keyboard is absolutely beautiful in all of its Glory. the looks of the laptop are classy. even though the laptop is made out of good plastic, it no way feels cheap and is almost premium feeling. the hinges are meant to have a better than normal design and improve the life (yes the aren't any normal kind of hinges you see in a laptop, and it looks cool too).\nthe display of the laptop is sleek with minimal bezels and the rest of the body feels a bit bulky but nothing too much.\nthe port placement is weird , all the USB are on the same side, the charging HDMI and Ethernet are on the back which is good actually, with no ports on the right. the fans blow the air out from the back and not from sides which is also quiet good.\n\nthe display is beautiful, might not be the best like an AMOLED screen but it is quiet good and the minimal bezels do provide immersive experience, the colours are quiet good and viewing angles are great. the 120hz goodness is amazing which only works when plugged in and is on 60 hz when running on battery.\nthe keys are fine, the lack of numpad even on the trackpad is a slight bummer to me atleast.\n\nperformance wise this is a beast.\n\nit has silent , performance & turbo mode(only available when plugged)\nAbout gaming :\nI could run pubg at 70-85 FPS with auto configured settings(which was high), 55-60 fps on ultra settings & 100+ on low settings.\nfortnite runs 70+ upto 85 fps on high settings and the auto recommended settings were on epic which runs at 60 fps.\nGTA V auto configured to very high settings on most and high in few and it ran 55-65 fps, I've changed the settings to mix of medium and high and run at 70-90 fps and sometimes touches 100 or more.\n\nwhat impressed me is that no matter the game settings the laptop handled it fine (even if it had to reduce the fps by a bit) and no game ran unpleasantly with hiccups in performance or stuck. but it may happen if you run another heavy app in the background.\n\nthe cooling is fine , a lot of heat is dissipated from the laptop while in turbo mode running a heavy game or any other heavy program and the fans on turbo mode can be heard but not much so as to call it a bummer.\n\noverall this is a lovely laptop for daily use, office use, gaming, or any other high intensity purposes. the display makes browsing or media consuming a delight, the aura sync is a neat party trick (coming from a person who isn't much into such gimmicks) & this device is worth every penny you spend.",
            "the device is fantastic. the look is awesome and it performs beyond my expectations... best in this price range.. bdw got it for 87k on A certain sale... highly recommend it",
            "Pros :\nI7 - 9750h at this price point\nGreat looks even though it\u2019s plastic made\nAsus aura sync looks great\nRuns most AAA on high ( ac odyssey - 45 fps, shadow of the tomb raider - 40 to 50 fps, dota 2 - 80 to 100 )\n120 hz\nGreat screen, good colors, great viewing angle\nGood keyboard\nFans are silent\n\nCons :\nBrightness is a bit low\nSpeakers are bad ( use headphones )\nNo webcam ( not a big deal though )\nModerate battery ( duh gaming laptop )\nRuns a bit hot while gaming ( cooling pad recommended )",
            "Great laptop go for it. the only problem is battery. better to wait for next year dussehra for good offers. It's really cool\nand wait after buying this laptop, you need to upgrade drives and software.\npros:\n1. SSD helps it to turn on fastly\n2. Trackpad and Keys precision is awesome. The finish of the keys and trackpad is way more than awesome!\n3. Nice RGB keyboard\n4. Thanks to Turbo mode. It cools laptop quickly. (works only while charging)\n5. lag free experience\n6. Included windows 10\ncons:\n1. No ms office included\n2. Some bugs in software for built-in including change in rgb lighting\n3. Battery life\n4. Sometimes screen casting would become problem\nThats it folks :)",
            "One of the finest laptop in the market. It's performance is great according to me has a 16gb ram 256 GB SSD so it works great. The appearance is one big best thing the RGB lighting in bottom of the laptop. And even the display is great. Overall I had a ever great experience with it.",
            "It's a beast if you are getting it for under 70K, Handles all the tasks smoothly. Aura lights are really cool and Asus armoury crate is packed with everything. Games run smoothly, faster installation. Battery back up is quite poor, hardly gets to 1 hour while gaming and 2 hours on general browsing. Build quality is okay, I loved the design though.",

            "it's been almost a month now.... works super smooth.... Powerful, sleek...... of course requires power so battery life is not much ....50 mins while gaming without plugged in for charging....1.5 to 2.5 hrs while web surfing n watching videos........N MOST IMPORTANT THING...

            "I would like to start with false marketing or say they hide some facts, and one should do proper research (by proper i mean going through every bit of statement and not just go for the product description as they suggest. Well thats the mistake on my part.) The laptop is quite good. I've been playing GTA V, Farcry Primal, PUBG and performance was good.\n\nMajor con which no one will mention here is that the keyboard is not per key RGB key board, which hence just makes the keyboard effects looks like cheap grade keyboard. doesn't matter you use aura creator or anything else. I own ROG-GL12 from where i thought of importing some Aura templates i created for my keyboard which didnt work properly, and now i know they have just given LEDs to make it look like the real deal. Disappointed!!!!",

            "Best in its league.\nDisplay is more than what i expected.\nHell of a Beast in Performance.\nDesign and build is fantastic.\nThe battery performance is average but that is expected from a gaming laptop with high speed fans and cooling grids. But the good part is that still you can control the fan speed which enables the user to not waste much battery on fans when you aren't doing heavy payload work.\n\nTo sum up, i have been using this laptop for more than 8 months now, and till now it has never disappointed me in any trait.",
            "Everything about this laptop is amazing, works very well, the fans are good the design is good and overall performance is nice the problems I found worth telling are the low battery life and it either works on 120hz or 48hz refresh rate",
            "Laptop it's really good. The performance of laptop is top notch .The Armoury crate software provided by Asus is excellent i would say , you will get a good control of the laptop.The storage on the laptop is adequate enough to store your data, but if you install more games at a time , then the storage might be an issue.The gpu performs really good on this device , no issue with gpu at all. And the way they designed the laptop for heat exchange is really good.The laptop doesn't get hot unless and until you do extensive gaming .I got this laptop during big billion day for 70k.Overall it is a very good laptop.I would rate it 4/5 because i feel for this price , they would have given Nvidia geforce gtx 1660 ti gpu, and also they have skipped on usb type-c and sd card reader and a webcam.If these factors doesn't bother you , then you can straight away pick it.This is a really good choice in the market , or else if you can extend your budget then you can take a look at Predator helios 300 which has Nvidia geforce gtx 1660ti gpu , usb type-c port etc",
            "Awesome laptop with all the features you need. The build is plastic,but it's very strong. The screen is immersive,with minimal bezels. The Aura lights add a cool effect.\n\nBattery is the biggest drawback, but its the same for most gaming laptops. If you are going to use Linux,you're in for a disappointment,with just under 1.5hrs. Everything else is fine",

            "Best product but go for 1660ti coz gtx1650 and 1660ti has bigger difference in graphics performance so better go for g731gt which is available offline but buy in ssd variant of 1tb or 512 gb ssd and go for i7 9th generation with 16gb ram and gtx1660ti 6gb graphics is the best solution if you try to add some what extra 8000rs.",
            "A very good laptop overall. The fans are very silent even at full RPM. The screen colour accuracy was not that great, maybe this is because it has less sRGB %. The build is plastic but its quite dense so no prob with that.",
            "I've been using it for 3 months now and whatever task I throw at it, It finishes it with ease without any hiccups. It really is a beast indeed. The render speeds, Gaming FPS, the refresh rate, the audio everything its complete elegance. I love it.",

            "I don't know how to review in details but here's my say on it because I bought it.\nI bought it exactly a year ago.\nSo the about the body, it's pretty stylish just like you see in the image. The colors are everywhere. It's body is built strong and it can handle some hits. But you shouldn't be careless enough to drop it.\nThe keypad is good but the arrow keys are small. You might take a time to adjust with them but it's all good.\nThe screen is decent. Can handle lights and it won't reflect.\nSo about the performance, the main thing. It's the best part of the laptop. I am no a pro gamer but I have played a lot of games like pubg, gtav, assassin's creed Odyssey etc and they all worked fine. Even in high graphics you won't notice any change.\nBut there was a problem while doing softwares. I also use it to do SketchUp and CAD. And it kinda gets slow when there are too many rendering and it gets you frustrated.\nTalking about the battery life, it's weak. You can use it without plugging into socket. You can play music, videos and do some office works without charging and will last for 3-4 hours but for gaming, always play while charging. Or else it won't work. Simple as that.\nAnd the sound system is pretty good. Not so dynamic but it's loud and clear.\nAnd there are few features given by asus to enhance the experience. Which is pretty good.\nThe only sad thing about this laptop is that it doesn't have a camera. I couldn't do video call on laptop during online classes and that kinda frustrated me because you pay so kuch and you don't get a camera. But that's just because of the classes.\nSo in overall, I think this laptop has every specs you need at a right price. And that's why I bought it. And I have had no issues with it upto date. It's been a year. Works just like the first day. You can go for it.",
