That's it.\nAfter 3 months of usage:\nBuild quality is below average, flimsy feel and somewhat loose joints and have sharp edges.",

If i upgrade to ssd this would surely come down. Over all very good laptop for gaming or editing or even profession use.",
            "HDD makes it very slow, it seems like you are using a 90's desktop from our childhood... An SSD upgrade is must in this varient. If you are purchasing this one.

In this generation it is necessary for a laptop to have a GPU for the laptop to last long.\n\nThe only issue with this laptop is heating issue.\nApart from that no issue.\n\nI mean what else can u expect from a gaming laptop.\nBattery backup is 2 hours max for heavy GPU use.(Gaming and editing)\nFor normal use it gives 6 hours - 8 hours backup.\n\nAfter few days OS keeps updating don't worry because it is OS issue not manufacture issue.\nIt is because it has HDD.\nIf u want more speed then purchase the SSD version.",

            "Got this at a price of 51k during sale. Totally satisfied with the outcome. Performance is great considering the price, get an additional SSD and RAM (personal suggestion). It will definitely turn this laptop into a beast. Battery backup is of approx 4-5 hours, which is very good for a gaming laptop. Display quality is nice, but I've been facing a bit of screen bleeding issue from the beginning. Since, there's no problem in display quality experience due to this, it's totally fine (exchanging and refunding process are very hectic for me). Getting this HDD version and adding a SSD costed me less than buying a SSD variant and an external HDD separately (as per requirement I needed more internal storage space). Go for the SSD variant 5600H model if storage is not your priority.",

            "Got this item at 54990. Delivery normal. Packaging normal.\nI'm gonna say I get the best deal at this price. Ryzen 4600H coupled with Nvidia 1650 (not the Max Q).\nBest at this price! I'm not buying this for gaming but I'm tempted.\nI needed the 1TB HDD for a reason. But imma buy an NVMe SSD 512GB or more later and upgrade this beast to its full potential.\n\nYou may go higher with better display like the 144 screen. I don't really care much because I'm gonna use an external monitor for my work.",
