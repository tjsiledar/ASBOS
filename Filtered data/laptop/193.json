            "It's good, specially best for students. But the battery backup and camera quality is not so good. And not for gaming like gta 5, bgmi, free fire. If you are a professional gamer then see other laptop.",
            "Writing review after thoroughly usage:\n\n1.Best part is SSD, boot time and performance are quick due to inbuilt SSD.\n2. Fingerprint scanner is too fast to unlock.\n3. It is lite weight & Design is good inspite of 15.6inch display.\n4. Battery backup is 5-6 hours of continuous use.\n\nWorst things in this model that can not be ignored are;\n\n1. Camera is useless, not good for regular use.\n2. This model promises UHD display but this is not perfect UHD.\n3. Speaker is not impressive and having lower volume due to position of speaker.\n\nOverall the product is good buy except the Camera, UHD & Speaker quality.\n\nIt would be a good buy If display size and camera are not an issue.",
            "Fast boot up, good design, cam is poor, good display, fingerprint access, 512ssd and 32optane with 4gb makes a fast boot up",
            "Except camera everything is very good, still 5 star because in this price range for me this is the best laptop.\nIt has 2 slots for memory so it is upgradable in future and one more thing in the product description nothing is specified about the battery life, but battery life is also very good.\nAny one who is looking for productive work can go for it easily (Just keep one thing in mind that camera quality is not good)",
            "Good quality product..\u2764\ufe0f",
            "1. Display Screen quality is best\n2. SSD hard drive works very fine.\n3. Processor and optane memory is also up to the mark.\n4. Design is average. Logo at the front is not looks dashing.\n5. Battary is good.\n6. Adapter is pretty.\n7. Overall Laptop is awesome.\n8. VGA camera quality is poor, not expected\n\nOverall Best Laptop I love it \ud83d\ude03",
            "Good laptop in this price.\nSpeed good.\nWindow 11 updated automatically.\nDisplay good , enough brightness. Narrow bezel.\nSlim and lightweight.\nMicrosoft 365 free not premium version.\nBattery backup ok.\nKeyboard good one .\nColor is not good only silver available.\nCamera not good",
            "The Laptop looks nice and even works amazing due to SSD which provides a great speed while working and even starts in few seconds which is remarkable. Best Budget Laptop which is amazing in everything like Battery backup, Performance, Touchpad mouse, its Finger print sensor and truly its Thin & Light laptop except the camera quality which can be manageable at these price. Must buy during the Sale period as it will cost you only 32K-33K instead of 38K-40K during normal period.",
            "1. Unmatchable performance boot will take hardly 5 seconds thats incredible!\n2. Battery is okay okay 6hrs\n3. Keyboard is nice but no backlit slightly disappointed\n4. Fingerprint reader is not bad sometimes i gotta press 2 to 3 times to unlock\n5. Built quality is not so bad and not good also but better than most of the laptops in this range\n6. No LAN port\n7. RAM management is not good i would like to say one shld upgrade but u can manage also not a problem imo\nas there is optane memory\n8. You can't play any high end games this ain't a gaming lap.\n9. Good for students who uses it for coding ppt browsing watchin streaming etc...\n10. Slight noise from the fan and some beeping sound is kinda annoying\n11.Display angle is not good but u cant expect more in this price range i guess.\n12. Crystal clear speaker (sonic master) not so loud but better than all acer high end laptops for damn sure lmao\n13. cant open in one hand light weight 45W charger ig not so fast charging but manageable\n\nWell thats it i guess if i find any issues i will definitely edit the review don't worry!!\n\nRest are fine Go For It If You Get It Below 35k\u270c\ufe0f",
            "Just an amazing laptop you can play a lot of games in that. Good to go for the students as well as the game lovers. The battery backup is phenomenal and the display is next level, you won\u2019t get a better laptop in this price range. Go for it without a doubt. The charger is a let off though looking at the size and the quality of the cable.",
            "Everything is good performance good display good and build quality is good but battery backup is not good I am not satisfied with battery backup it more than 2, 3 hours you can use",
            "I m giving feedback after using it for 20 days ....it's good enough to fulfill all your academic needs as well as designing and coding requirements.\nIt has 512gb SSD so it's boosting is also quite fast",
            "*pros:-\n*For this segment it is the correct choice\n*boot up speed is very fast because of inbuild ssd\n*Fingerprint reader was very fast in this segment it has a fingerprint reader I was so excited\n*battery was around 8 hours of continuous use at best performance\n*dual speaker sound is prity well tuned\n*sleek design and comfortable to use portable\n*I have used Dell i5 processor and hp i5 processor laptop they haved sometimes a lag and bugs this asus laptop is ultimate because it was so smooth to use thanks to asus to give such a laptop for this price segment.\n\n*Cons:-\n*Camera is usable for online classes not for workers like me for IT's and etc...,",
            "I'm writing this review after 7 days of using it.\n1)The package was well packed and delivered on time.\n2)The booting time of the laptop is about 2-3 seconds.\n3)The speed is very good for an average daily tasks(I've uploaded an image where you can see that I was running all the necessity apps and judge by yourself by looking at the graph of cpu performance)\n4)The fingerprint works like a charm, it's so quick and fast, in an instant.\n5)It's already pre-loaded with basic features/apps including Windows 10(lifetime) which is upgradable to windows 11.\n\nBesides all these many unsaid positive feedbacks I'd like to mention some few cons which might help you decide for the best product.\n1)The no. one drawback could be it's battery, though it charge very fast(like in 1&1/2 hours) it drain quick too when in heavy task mode(like 3-4 hours). But it last very long when it's not in heavy task.\n2) Don't ever expect to use the webcam. If webcam is your priority you can still go for this and add external webcam.\n3)It lack keyboard backlight.\nOverall a good product at the offered price. I spent a good amount of time researching about a decent laptop at my affordable budget and I finally chose this product over others. No regrets. Hope you make the best choice. \ud83d\ude0a",
