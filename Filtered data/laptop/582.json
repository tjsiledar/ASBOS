            "I was in confusion before order, when I received my lappy really loved it. Asus should we go this, yes of course in this process segment fingerprint unlock, compact design, backlit keyboard and superb display etc.. I really like my asus app for getting my laptop updated and healthy. Fast Charging is available. Battery i have not checked but fine decent packaging fast delivery thanks flipkart.",
            "After using 15 days I would say product is good to buy.\n1. Sleek design.\n2. Light weight.\n3. Good battery backup.\n4. Good performance according to configuration.\n5. Sound and display is average.\nHowever my experience with flipkart is horrible but rating is given here to product - Asus Vivobook X413JA. I found it value for money and would suggest to go for it.",
            "Best compact laptop but build quality is not metalic!\nBattery backup is good sound quality is descent and display is very bright 250nits",
            "Excellent performance\n1.nvme m.2 ssd blazing speed\n2. Light weight\n3. Compact design\n4. Touch pad and finger lock feel like mobile touch and many features include\n5. Decent battery backup",
            "It is as I expected. Light, sleek, compact and decent quality. I really like its white colour glossy finish.\nI recieved this on 8.03.2021 in 36240 rupees.\nAnd I think in this price range no product exist today. And its specs are awesome.",
            "Worth purchase for students and who have just lite work .Everything is top notch except the battery I can't say its worst but it is less then the other laptops which are available in this price segment.",
            "This is nice laptop and performance are very smooth and looking is very pretty this is a light laptop and i got this in diwali sell and price this laptop 32737 and battery backup around 4to5 hour\nThis review after 8 days",
            "The laptop is thin and handy.. due to SSD booting speed is around 6 seconds. The ms office key is not included. Processor fan is close to display ,so you will feel warm .\nBacklit keyboard is advantage. I dont see in any other model under 38k.\n\nBrought it for 33250 including bank offer and serve the purpose.\n\nIf you look for a stylish ,handy and daily use laptop..go for it . !!",
            "After one month of use ASUS VIVOBOOK 14/15 i3 core laptop value of money and good performance.\nIn this laptop there is baklit keyboard, which gives good typing experience in night and a finger prit reader for the security.\nThere is 14\" antiglare display and tracked is also good and fast.\nThis LAPTOP is good for daily work and also for student..\nNumber of ports:-\n1 HDMI\n1 Charging port\n1 USB type C\n3.5mm earphone jack\n1 memory card reader\n3 USB type A",
            "Camera quality of this laptop is very bad. It is like 1990's camera with lot of bubbles. Even the a 5K mobile will have better camera. If you are planning to use this for video calls as a presenter, then this is not the choice.\n\nAlso the customer support is very bad, not able to connect with them through call or chat properly.\n\nApart from this all other features are good",
            "My Lappy....\nDREAM COMES TRUE",
            "Its light, looks sleek, display is awesome (it gives you those matte screen vibes) and performance depends on your usage. If you are a student, perform basic coding and need a laptop for your school/college assignments (ppt, doc etc.) under 40k which comes with a BACKLIT keyboard!! Just go for it!!\n\nNow coming to your main concern, is 4gb ram enough?\n1st, yes! It is enough, if you are not editing videos or playing games ( it's not a gaming laptop tbh)\n2nd, you can increase the ram upto 12 gb. Yup!! It comes with a second slot. So, if you feel like you need to increase the ram, buy one (2,4,8 according to your need).\n\nNow, about the battery backup. It's about 3-4 hrs if you are performing a lot of tasks. Kinda disappointing\u2510(\uffe3\u30d8\uffe3)\u250c\nBut it's fine if we look at the price we are getting it.\nOther two cons:\nNo MS office ( they have already mentioned)\nSlows down if you install skin (\u3012\ufe4f\u3012)",
            "Best Laptop in 35k.. Looks premium and attractive.\n\nPros:-\n(1) It comes with 14 inch Anti Glare Ips screen... Which u can not found in any laptop in this price segment.\n(2) premium design, Good build Quality.\n(3) Best combination of Windows 10th gen with 512gb makes working super smooth.\n(4) Hermon Cardon spekars are not so much loud but pleasent to hear...\n\nCons:- Battery... It has almost 4 hrs battry backup with medium brightness level.\nBuild Quality:- Build quality can be more better as compare to HP Brand laptops.\nRest is fine... A Good deal in 35k.",
            "First I was very confused which laptop I have to purchase. As I am master's student so I have to do a lot of assignments and presentations. I was searching a laptop which is good enough for all the parameters light weight, fast, good design, decent memory. As I am not a heavy user. For my type of persons it will be best & it is unbeatable. Because 1TB HDD can not beat 512 GB SSD & SSD is very fast as compared to HDD. Laptop boots in just 7-8 Seconds. Best feature is fingerprint sensor. It is best in its class no company is offering it under 40K. Secondly it have backlight display which appears very beautiful while working in night. Other features includes its weight that is very very light. Hardly equal to a medium size book.\nI will give you premium and decent look when you will saw it to anyone. Although battery is average but not a hurdle. I think it is best laptop for study. You will find everything good in it. It somewhat gives you feeling of MacBook. You will lack MS office which you can easily get online or anywhere else. One also very good feature it have its speakers i.e. Harmon kardon which is parent company of JBL & it have inbuilt antiglare night display which will be good for everyone.",
            "Best laptop for students and working professionals. Finger print sensor is just awesome. Decent battery life. If you are looking for a laptop for regular office works or if you are a student, then you can go for it. But, I've not played heavy games yet.",
            "Good product by Flipkart and it work so fast and smooth.\nBattery Backup upto 6 hrs with Internet + Display on use.\nOverall it was a awesome product by Asus.",
            "Wonderful, nice product.\nPros =\n1. Wonderful design & build quality\n2. Smooth & fast performance\n3. Nice Display\n4. Backlit & smooth keyboard\n5. Light weight\n6. Surprisingly super fast fingerprint sensor\nCons =\n1. This type of blue color. I personally like blue color, but not this cobalt blue. Peacock blue is more attractive than this. I recommend black color of this model.\n2. Microsoft word /excel not included, only 15 days trial pack included. This is disgusting.\n3. This model comes with harman/kardon sound effect. But honestly I don't understand the difference of sound quality compare to a ordinary sound quality laptop, both like same. No option or app for harman/kardon sound effect.\nOverall this is a nice & good looking laptop for medium work.",
            "1.Elegant design, light weight , performance is good.\n2.Harman Kardon audio is very good but no difference with sonic master or other.\n3.Average or say below average camera- maxi 0.9mp HD camera but better than other brand(in other brand generally 0.3 mp hd cam) at similar price range.\n4. Battery : max 4 hrs to 4 & 1/2 hrs backup\n5. Very attractive coloured Enter key. Like a sweet smile of that girl of a classroom who attract everyone eyes.\n6. Keys are soft to press but touchpad left and right click key sounds which I dislike.\n7. Black color is awesome. General use Lappy.\nOther detail ,I will post later\n\nKind atten: Flipkart : Please improve your delivery , I got this in 15 days.",
            "The product is amazing and this product is delivered today and i am software engineer and i have a lot of works such as compiling the project and much more work so this is faster for compiling the project dont escape for gaming performance.,,,,",
            "I ordered the cream color version but got the black one...(one star less for that)\n**Battery backup is averege\n**Display is awesome considering the price\n**Sound output is really good\n**I assumed it a bit faster in processing before purchasing it(my personal experience)\n**Built quality could have been better\n**Have some handy features (one can insert sd card without card reader and so on.....)\nOverall its a balanced Laptop for students and I got it at 36890",
            "I have got this for my wife and its perfect for her light usage.\n\n1. i3 10th gen is around 6% slower than i5 8th gen.\n2. nvme m2 sdd is an plus.\n3. small, sleek light, just like a notebook it can fit in your bag.\n4. Harman Kardon (:D) okay, this branding is good for satisfaction. You will not find any much difference when compared with sonicmaster.\n5. silent machine.\n6. that yellow return key is an added advantage (you know, Girls :p, that is what her colleagues noticed first)\n\nPeople demotivate you for buying an Asus. so why did I get one?\nAnswer is simple, Personal experience.\nI am using ROG Since past 2 years,\nI got its main board blown due to moisture in just 2 months. (due to my mistake, I kept it packed in its box in the cupboard after usage. NEVER DO THIS.)\nI just contacted Asus Support, I got my board replaced hassle free.\nOption to Avail service onsite or carry in.\n(My experience applies to Pune's service center, Data care corp. in deccan )\n\nNote: If you requirements are slightly moderate to heavy, then you should not go for systems with i3, or else you will end up complaining.",

            "The laptop is very handy and light weight. I have used it for around 10 days and it is working perfectly fine. The battery is not that good, when I have used it for online class and switched on the video, in full charge it gave back up of 2 hour only, whereas if we use it normaly for typing watching movie or pdf reading the back up was about 3:30 hr. Overall I am having good experience with the laptop.",
            "I have got this few hours back. The packing was awesome. These features and price is juz a fab combo.the nly thing is u can't upgrade ram. This is perfect for basic users like me. I mean for small programmings n codings. This is not a gaming laptop. This is perfect for average and below average users.",
            "I can tell u exactly that it is the best laptop under 40k . It has all the features a nrml laptop should have. Amazing design and display. Loud and clear sound. Powerful system with no lag. Good battery and charging. Well suited best for me bcz i do online classes and got it with offers in 37k.",

Flipkart deliver this product is delay 2 day after promise date is 18 day . flipkart is very poor delivery service so not buy any product very important and fast needed on flipkart",
            "The laptop features a core i3 processor with 4GB RAM that handles the tasks quite swiftly. Overall a good buy.\n\nPros:\n1. Handy\n2. Lightweight and portable\n3. Good build quality\n4. Good performance in the budget range\n5. Good battery life (around 5 to 6 hours)\n\nCons:\n1. Display (although it claims to be an IPS panel, the viewing angles are not good and the display looks pale)\n2. Speaker quality is not good out of the box (although it can be modified and tuned later through Asus AudioWizard app that is provided in built)\n\nOver the current shortage in the stocks of laptops, this can be considered a good buy at 36990.",
            "1) Display is ok. Viewing angles are not too good not too bad. Under 40k it is good.\n\n2) Battery is not good. Don't expect it to last more then 3 hrs. Charging takes almost 3 hrs from 15 %.\n\n3) Performance is good. Ssd is too good. Boot up timing is less then 7 sec. Performance is also good for normal day to day usage.\n\n4) Camera is ok . Under good light it is better then the rest under 40 k\n\n5) Sound is not loud enough. But the quality is good.the tuning is good.\n\n6) Build quality is good.\n\nOverall good buy under 40k .",
            "Item has been delivered on 25th. Editing it after 5 days.\nEven though it is i3, it works pretty good.\nThe only con i feel is its top portion always get dirty and our finger marks remains there like oily. And a Little low brightness.\nThe display and perfomance is pretty good. But feels like too small laptop, because it has narrow side and all. But it is light weight\nFingerprint sensor is pretty good.\n\nThe webcam is too worse, very noisy and reddish. It is 0.9 MP cam and it is very worse.\n\nOverall 7.5/10\n\nIf you want to go for work purpose, study etc.. go for it.\nNot recommend for entertainment, gaming etc...",
            "I m writing this review after 2 days usage , Nice product only good for low to moderate usage , battery backup is also good 5hrs (non-stop) usage , Best for commerce student and office purpose . Don't opt this laptop for video editing ,coding as well gaming .",

The fingerprint sensor works very well .\nThe SSD makes the computer really fast , which is a huge plus.\nDefinitely recommend if you are on a budget.",
            "Really a good product\nI felt every feature is ok or good at this price segment\nIm only disappointed with the size(13\"),and its a personal matter only... Else it is very compact and easy to handle.. Worth for the money",
            "This product is good but due to misinformation, it is not getting attention. first of all this is asus vivobook 14 model. now talk about specification.\n\nHere is some differences from others\n\nDisplay-display is good, not best\nPerformance - good\nBoot up time 9 sec only\nKeyboard - backled keyboard is very good\n\nNot for gaming\n\nBattery - if you are not going to use heavy tasks in it then it gives you more then 6 hours easily. Yes, you will be face disappointment at the first time. ...\nREAD MORE",
            "Good for it's price range.. and has way better build quality than HP or Lenovo in this price range. Good for simple office task (excel, powerpoint, browsing, etc). Don't buy it if you want to play games. Increase your budget and buy better asus rog laptop.",
            "This is laptop for People who looks for elegant design, great disay and for normal usage like browsing, excel & two apps in background.\nIt's good for students and people who begins to work in laptop.\nThe performance is good enough and battery backup is good to last for 5 to 6 hours based on usage.\nYou won't get Microsoft 365 access which is to be noted.\nI liked it for the display, design and some features like backlit keyboard & fingerprint scanner in this price segment.",
            "As far as best product in this price range, 512 gb SSD, keyboard backlighting, fingerprint crips display i3 which is more than enough for regular work and programming.\n\nReally stylish look and light weight",
            "Good Product but if you are using a bigger size laptop and are going to upgrade to this one then you will feel it smaller. But it is very good . Sometimes it creates some noise due to its fans but it is very compact able and the storage speed is good as it comes with SSD the performance is also average at all it is a multi-purpose laptop. It had no graphics card as it is not a dedicated gaming laptop but some games like minecraft , gta sa , gta vc etc. Run very smoothly. You can buy this laptop for basic work and bit little gaming.",

            "My 2nd Asus laptop. Lightning fast thanks to the SSD. starts up and shuts down in a flash. No lag. Good screen. Better than average battery life. Reliable quality",
            "I got this machine at an offer price of 34k during Big Billion Days. I received it on 08th Nov'20 and I am giving my comprehensive review after a full day of extensive usage. In short, this is a superb laptop at such low price and students/professionals can definitely buy this if they don't require heavy memory/graphic usage.\n\nComing to the detailed review now:\n\nUSP: This laptop is a steal deal at 34k due to the 512GB SSD available, which runs super smooth.\n\nPros:\n1. Design: The look and finish of this laptop are immensely attractive. You may go for the blue colour variant as it looks amazing.\n2. Weight: The laptop feels really light and easy to handle\n3. Speed: The SSD really gives a big push to the performance as this system boots up and shuts down really fast. The average time for starting-up being 8-9 seconds and for shut-down, it's just 2 seconds.\n4. Touchpad and finger-sensor: Both of these work like a charm\n5. Keyboard: The board feels really smooth and the backlight option is like a cherry on the cake\n6. Battery: While continuously streaming videos, the battery drained completely in 5 hours, which is pretty decent. Do not expect a longer backup than this while heavy usage\n\nCons:\n1. Display: The display is not very vibrant but at such a price, the display offered seems quite good\n2. Sound: I had honestly bought this laptop with no expectations with sound (as per the older reviews), but the sound is actually not that bad. The volume is definitely lower than my old Lenovo laptop, but it is still pretty decent in itself. There no Harman/Kardon software provided though, to control the sound quality.\n3. Camera: The camera is pretty decent during the daytime, but it gets a lot of grains during the night. It could definitely have been better.\n4. MS Office: This comes just for a free one-month trial\n5. RAM slot: The RAM is soldered onto the motherboard and with the absence of additional slots, one cannot increase the memory in future\n\nOverall, this laptop is a superb machine at this price with various top features. If you're not expecting a very high-end gaming performance from this machine, you may blindly go for it.",
            "Ordered this laptop on big billon day\u2026 Looks and feel is awesome. Listen below pros n cons\npros:\n1. Very light weight which makes it easy to carry n easy to handle.\n2. Blue colour gives it a fantastic look.\n\nCons:\n1. Touchpad makes little bit of sound, which is annoying\n\nNote:Performance is ok\u2026need to see how it behave when i use it extensively",
            "I have been using this Laptop for minimal usage and thanks to it's turbo boost technology and it's SSD which is prefect for any kind of tasks the SSD covers the speed considering ut has 4GB soldered RAM(cannot be upgraded), I'm happy with the product for normal to moderate usage and Yes it has slight heating issues even after SSD, if you connect the adaptor and use it gets very warm sometimes very much and good thing is th fan doesn't make much sound but not much effective to cool it faster.\n\nThis Laptop would be good for Normal to Moderate work even the office work, Battery is quite low but sufficient, Speakers are amazing by Harman Kardon and Really Good display can handle 4K video playing very smoothly and easily.\n\nUnder 35, it has best Value for money with Backlit keyboard and very decent stylish Design.\n\nHighly recommended for office and students work purposes!",
            "After two months usage,i definitely recomend to you\n\ndon't panic for RAM..it supports upto 32 gb\n\n100% upgradeable\n\njust go to command promt on this lap\n\nthen paste this on comnd\n\nwmic memphysical getmaxcapacity, memorydevices\n\nthen enter u get\nmax capacity and max slots available",
