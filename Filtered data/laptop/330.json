            "The laptop is a beast...can run all the AAA titles around high to very high, RTX 2060 is upto the mark.\n\nIn terms of video editing i7 10th gen along with graphic does a good job, rendered 8 min video in premiere pro in just around 1:30 min, and a composition about 40 sec in after effects took 18 min, which is a remarkable time limit I must say.\n\nDelivery might be late a day or two because of the time of pandemic but product will reach you\n\nREVIEWS AFTER 8 DAYS OF EXTREME USE\nPROS -\n1. RTX 2060\n2. Cooler fans\n3. i7 10th gen\n4. 16 gb ram\n5. Fast processing\n6. Per key RGB gives a great perspective too\n7. Audio is good (with nahimic software by msi)\n\nCONS -\n1. Battery life\n2. Lags rarely (not a major issue)\n3. Charger need a 16 amp power socket\n\nRest is all good...I can recommend this beast to anyone anyday...don't think about it twice....JUST GO FOR IT.",
            "After waiting for eternity to purchase a good Laptop at a good price, I had given up on i7+RTX specs under 1Lac but suddenly came across this product under 1 lac, did a bit of research and finally bought it. Have been using it for about a month and so far feels like a remarkable purchase! Laptop is very smooth, feels very premium, can handle many resource hungry games like a piece of cake, impressive looks, great RGB keyboard with amazing heptic feedback, touchpad is very smooth, heat dissipation is effective and yes, i7+RTX2060+16GB RAM+SSD just kills it!\nNote: 16GB RAM is divided into 8+8 with both slots occupied ; SSD has one M.2 slot and is occupied so any SSD expansion will require replacement of the existing one.\n\nOverall a very happy purchase for me!",
            "So this laptop is quite good at this range. Used it on multiple AAA titles like apex witcher warzone and most of them were running smoothly at over 100 fps .\nBattery is okay that is quite known for these laptop.\nCooling is quite good as temperature is low at even long gaming sessions.\nOverall a good laptop with decent value for money.",
            "I've owned this laptop for a few weeks now, and I can say at this moment that it's pretty cool. It has a nice premium look to it, I love the combination of the black and gunmetal gray, and the thin bezeled screen is wonderful; she's not kidding when she says the screen is decent. the color accuracy is remarkable and the 144hz refresh rate helps to keep everything crystal clear. Not to mention that this thing can be crazy fast when opening apps and such.\n\nYou'll love this computer from the moment you fire it up and are greeted by its cool keyboard which is vividly backlit with a scrolling light show of rainbow colors. It can be a bit heavy (obviously because of the high performance hardware in it) though. Nonetheless, it's interestingly more compact than your average 15.6 laptop due to the thin bezel around the screen.\n\nSo far, 1L (I upgraded the ram and SSD) well spent.",
            "This is the best that you will get it this price range. Superb display quality and top notch performance.\n\nBattery life could have been better.",
            "I'm really happy with this purchase... First, I received a defective product, after 10 days I got my replaced new product, but it is worth waiting for. The seller (CORSECA) helped me a lot with the replacement.\nI rate 5 out of 5 for Seller.\n\nLaptop Review: (After 2 Months of Usage)\nWhen it comes to performance, it's literally a beast. It runs AAA Titles and Professional software with buttery smoothness. Great gaming experience with 144Hz Display.\nThis CPU and GPU combo gives better performance. Thermal Throttling issues are present, but after under-volting it is good. Screen bleeding is present but not considerable when it comes to a gaming laptop with a 144Hz display.\n\nPROS\nCPU Performance (Boost Clock 5GHz)\nGPU Performance (6GB RTX 2060)\n144Hz Panel (Good Gaming Experience)\nSteel Series Keyboard (Easy to access)\nGiant Speak (Clear and Loud Audio Output)\nCooler Boost 5 (6000+ RPM Dual Fans)\n3-Way Heat Vents\nExtraordinary Battery Durability Features\nSupports Windows 11 With TPM (Trusted Platform Module)\nType C Port (No Thunderbolt Support But okay)\nHDMI and Mini Display Port (4K With 30 FPS)\n256GB SSD + 1TB HDD (Perfect Combo), Etc.\n\nCONS:\nLittle Screen Bleeding.\nLittle Noisy Sound in Cooler Boost mode.\n\nOverall, the best ever laptop I had. If your budget is 90k to 1L, then without a second option, purchase this one (based on my perspective).",
            "This is my genuine experience about this laptop and the journey of finding this machine\n\nI am a disappointed HP 15 laptop owner looking for a good laptop for long term use and msi wasn't in my mind at all....i used to look upon rog,TUF, Predator..etc but was never satisfied in one or the other categories but at one fine day my eyes went upon this laptop and did a whole 4 months research about the msi laptops and their reliability...and was shocked by seeing the heritage and tough build quality and mainly their thermals!! and finally bought this laptop and truly became a fan of MSI the build quality of this laptop is just mind boggling and it's thermal performance is just magical...i literally cried by seeing the outstanding performance in every aspect and they thought every possible to be the best while designing this laptop....\n\nFeatures that im fan of!\n*Cooler boost 5\n*We can turn off the trackpad while using a mouse..so, no accidental touches while gaming\n*We can flip the window key with the function key which was really thoughtful and helpful for those who are used to the left side windows key\n*Steelseries keyboard n number of ways to customise it\n\nIf you are thinking about the battery life it was pretty decent for its tier\n\nConclusion: JUST GO FOR IT!",
            "Using for two weeks now. My two primary needs was data science work and medium level gaming. Excellent performance in both the fields. coders will love typing in this keyboard.",
            "Ordered on 24/06/2021 received on 25/06/2021, was expected on 26/06/2021. Fast delivery within one day. Product package from flipkart was damaged. But internal package from msi was secure. The laptop was as per the specs . Booting is fast one time setup takes a few minutes but its for the first time only so no probs. Over all its awesome. Will use for some more time and give a detailed review",
            "This laptop has checked all the boxes and then delivered more in terms of software support and tricks which make it an overall amazing choice by date in my case.\nThe only drawback is a smaller battery, but even then they provide the option to undervolt the settings and change user profile to provide a better battery performance.\nThey did not cut corners to create this beautiful machine and I can easily say that if you want to experience top notch performance on a budget, this can easily give you all that and maybe a bit more.",
            "1.Good laptop. Got this at 97k.\n2.Battery good enough only for a couple of hours.\n3.Runs all games and softwares smoothly.\n4.Undervolt cpu while gaming to get reduced temp.\n5.speaker quality not very good. But you can't ask for a better config at this price.",
            "Its a great alternative for high-end gaming PC.i wasn't sure of MSI brand but the laptop has all high quality components and a great (at least online one that i tried) support. A great purchase for gaming with portability.",
            "The best you can get in price. Better than all the macs available even M1 is nothing compared to this beast.",
            "4.5/5\n\nHave cut a rating of 0.5 only because of a not very good battery. Discharges in just 1.5-2 hours.\nPerformance: Awesome\nDisplay: Awesome\nTurbo Boost mode: Awesome\nDoesn't heat at all at heavy gaming (GTA V and Fifa 21 at highest graphics)\n\nOver-all worth buying!!",
            "Adding my comment here after a 1\u00bd Month usage.\n\n1. Performance was Awwwwsome.. Just loved it.\n2. Smoothness - Perfect no issue.\n3. I used to play high graphics game like Assassin's creed, Red Redemption - Graphics were awwwsome. Its really very very very very very very nice..\n4. It is easy to make changes on battery mode based on ur purpose of usage.\n5. Display - observed in many comments said like there is a bleeding on screen on dark / black screen, but it doesn't matter yet for 2-3secs max. It doesn't seems to be major effect as display switches on to password enter page / windows home page we don't see anything & display looks good & awesome.\n5. Coming to the main part --> BATTERY BACKUP, same thing as many said like battery backup is acceptable, ok, fine, not much stable.... It depends on the User. Below are my observations with Full charge 100 - 5 & Performance level in 'High'.\ni) Full charged - Mode changed to Super battery. Left idle without working anything and checked - Stood for 5hrs 37mins.\nii) Same on Super battery mode - was doing a game install process in background - stood for 3hrs 43mins.\niii) Switched to SILENT mode - no difference on Silent mode Super battery. Only thing the Cooler fans will be work on limit with slow run on both mode.\niv) Switched to BALANCED mode - here u can come to know from the word Balanced no need to explain it. Here u can observe on Cooler fans will start their job with bit faster based on ur work. Stood for 3hrs 12mins\nv) Switched EXTREME PERFORMANCE mode - Samewise u can understand from the name. Its mainly use of gaming purpose, Cooler fans start their job on 6000RPM speed, bit noise on silent room but its not a matter. Stood for 2hrs 4mins without charger plugged-in while playing Far Cry, Assassin's creed, Red Redemption. Without plugin observed a laggyness on high level graphics gameplay, after plugin asusual its ur time to rock.\n6. HEATNESS - I observed heatness after a bit long usage without a break on playing a high-level graphics games. But its not a matter to those cooler fans leave it idle for 5-10mins, back to normal.\n\nIt's my 1st personal laptop bought after loooooooooooong time. I choose this & am very happy with it now and am very satisfied with the system on this price range. Just go for it guys dont bother about the screen bleeding, battery backup, heatness blah blah blah, again am saying its depend on ur usage... Just go for it...\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83e\udd17\ud83d\ude0a",
            "This laptop comes with i7 and NVIDA RTX for 1 Lakh which is reasonable. Packed with great performance which will run most of the games in high graphics but still i recommend to tweak down the setting to keep laptop stable and also the fan is bit noisy. It has 16A power plug which may be replaced with 6A desktop computer power wire than buying cheap plug converters. It may melt during long gaming hours.",
            "We can't get such a laptop with these insane specs.\ni7 and rtx2060 just makes it an all rounder.\nColour accurate topnotch display make it suitable for gaming as well as creation..\n144Hz refresh rate is best for gaming\nCompletely customisable. RGB keyboard\nWe need to compromise battery life as it is normal for a gaming laptop..\nIt can handle intensive tasks like a piece of cake.\nSuitable for adobe after effects,davinci resolve, all adobe stuff\ud83d\ude39.\nAlso web cam is given as an added bonus camera quality is good\nIt is much better than acer predator and asus tuf\n\u2022MSI Motherboards are unbeatable and powerful\n\u2022MSI RTX 2060 is way better than others\n\u2022Top Notch colour accurate display\n\u2022Best heat dissipation ever......\nValue for money..... True beast\nNote: buy a 16A switch board to connect to the charger{plug converters not recommended for long term use}\nJust proceed with it you can't get anything better in this budget range",
            "One of the best laptops i ever used. Good performance. Excellent thermal properties. Best in class cooling. only downside is battery life is too low.",
            "If you want to play games and watch movies and some normal work like photoshop or video editing then this is the best laptop under this range but if you are working in game development or 3d then i would say this is not the one which you should buy .. i work in unreal (game development software) so i was not even able to open the project which was of 16 gb it took 1hour or more to open then it just crashed . I did some more projects in 3d the result was the same so for playing games its good for working in 3d its not that good\nWho can buy this just giving rating out of 5\n1.Gamers (5)\nDid live stream of gta 5 full graphics no lag\nDid fifa 21 live stream no lag\n2.Web developer or software engineer (5)\nI worked on some projects it was fine as writing code is not performance heavy\n3.Streamer (5)\nDid streaming\n4.Graphic designer (5)\nI dont do this but it not that heavy\n5.video editor (5)\nDid some renders were pretty fast\n6.3d (2)if modeling a big scene\nWorking on a big scene in blender and facing a lot of problems like slow and laggy performance\n7.3d (4) if modeling a single object\n8.Game developer (2)\nCant work on big scenes for aaa games it keep loading shaders until the death\nWorked on 2 engines unity and unreal\nFor unity i cant say much it was working fine but for unreal its just unreal to run",
            "A amazing gaming Laptop in this range. Great specs, RTX 2060 is rocket like fast. Thin bezels make its dimension good.\n\nPro:\n1. Nice build quality and good looks\n2. Smooth gaming experience\n3. Amazing SteelSeries keys\n\nCons:\n1. Poor battery life, but can't expect more from gaming laptop\n\nOverall amazing product",
            "After 1 week of usage, I'm sharing my little experience...\n\nFirst of all Fast Delivery ( flipkart and it's courier partner ekart did great job )\n\nPro's:-\n* Performance is amazing as you can do multitask while playing AAA gaming titles\n* Cooling system love it ! You have to enable performance mode or can be turn on cooler booster manually to reduce it's temperature after heavy work or gaming\n* You don't need to worry about it's operating system if you feel operating system is not working well (rare chance), because you can reset to it's factory settings\n* Dragon Center let you monitor performance and temperature of your gaming laptop and steal series software to customize your glowing keyboard :)\n* Most of popular AAA gaming titles run above 60fps in high settings\n\nCon's:-\n* Screen bleeding ( visible only on black screen at high brightness example: when operating system boot )\n* Most of time fps below 60 while playing GTA Online but it's normal, no worry about game performance\n\nAfter all I can say that this gaming laptop is Best under 100K for Multitasking, Gaming and Heavy Work :)",
            "After use of 1 month I am writing this review\nDisplay is awesome,nura effect is there bt after some time it will gone\nPerformance is great RTX is best\nDesign is awesome\nSpeed is on it peak point,too fast and smooth\nSome heat issues bt only when use of high and long time",
            "Pros : Temps can be below 75 in balanced mode with medium-low settings and can play any AAA title at 60fps easily.\n\nIdle temp is 40-45\n\nI can see temps going above 95 only when gaming mode is on. Its better to switch it off unless you are playing competitive multiplayer.\nI suggest to change the maximum processor state to 97-98\n\nCons :\nDisplay is just ok .There's low to minimum screen bleeding\nBattery backup could be better\nAnd if you are opting for standard EMI there will be processing fee of 3k (not mentioned in product page) . In my case it is kotak\n\nInitially got one with heavy screen bleeding visible while playing videos and games. Happy that seller CORSECA has replaced it but still there is little bleeding but doesn't interfere with the videos or games . so I kept it.",
            "I bought this laptop for around Rs98000 and I must say the product is good. The built quality is very good metal top and optimum ventilation for cooling.\nPros:\n1. The screen is Full HD (1080p) is sufficient for editing and other jobs.\n2. I am a video editor so rendering speed are so great, it takes around 2-3 minutes to render a 10 min video 1080p video.\n3. It has backlit keypad, which looks attractive.\n4. The price is justifiable for the specifications.\nCons:\n1. The battery life could be improved, at power saving mode it gives 3-3.5 hours.\n2. The product is a bit bulky but sturdy so might not call it a con.\nOther wise perfect for this budget.",
            "Writing the review after 3 months of use\n\nBattery is draining so fast and its not lasting for 1 hr also.\nMSI support team replied like its a gaming laptop so its normal\u2026\n\nWhen i kept the laptop ideal also the battery is draining so fassssssssttttttt\u2026. 4% to 5% of charge ll get drained in a minute\u2026\n\nWaste of money\n\nDnt trust MSI INDIA PRODUCT",

            "needed a laptop that would cover my gaming needs for the next 2-3 yrs and 144Hz was must.\nSo, within 1 lakh budget I think this is the best gaming laptop to get.\nbattery life is average\nI was bit worried about heating issue but GP65 surprised me, heating management is way better compared to other gaming laptop",

            "Best for gaming and editing.. so far it's performance is good.. battery will last for 2.5hrs that's the only draw back. 256ssd will be filled soon if you download and install more games and apps so 512ssd should have been given with this. Speakers are ok but don't expect more on this. Screen bleeding was there but not more. I heard in all IPS display it will be there.. anyways we have 2 years warranty on laptop so thats not the issue for now.",
            "People will tell you about the Pros, let me tell you the Cons,\n\nA bit noisy and the system gets heated but what hell this is a Gaming PC.\nThe Plug is a a big plug and you need to find 15 watts holder, I myself have used a converter.\nThe new NVIDIA update makes the screen flicker so you need to roll back to the older version.\nScreen bleeding can be seen, but this is the problem with all gaming laptops.\nThe steel series Keyboard is pretty good, but the key alignment is bad, I would suggest you to get a additional mechanical Keyboard.",

            "Although the laptop is good ...there is a problem related to battery...i dont know its a problem or what because battery drain as fast as possible even it did not survived upto 1 hour without charge ...but this problem can be ignored because gaming laptops battery donot last long as when the performance mode is on the gpi starts working and we know it has a massive rtx 2060 gpu. But the real problem is when i shift laptop from performance mode to battery savings mode the laptop performance gets even worst as the dail or common work will also lag. so if you are heavy charged laptop user so this laptop is not for you go for the other one and if you can keep laptop in charging then its a beast which have no competetion in this 1lac price range.",

Runs watch dogs 2, gta 5, star wars games at ultra resolution with ease\n3. I also use it for development for AR/VR applications using Unity, Android studio & Vuforia and I had less prob compared to my acer one(though the laptop does gets heated up with continuous andriod studio usage but which one does not?!)\n4. The RGB keyboard is good. I use it with a single tone color which suits my needs\n\nCons\n1. Sound is very less compared to acer or other series. Mic is not that good\n2. Tremendous heat buildup from prolonged usage either for gaming or high end programming.\n3. There's some noise which comes from laptop occasionally when we switch it on (which goes away after shutting down & restarting the machin) I am yet to take it to service center\n4. Worrying situation about service center availability\n\nBottomline, except for few cons, this is worth ur buy",

So, happy with the game playing and coding, if electricity is there.",

So that's something that you should watch out for.\n\nAll in all a good value for money buy.",
