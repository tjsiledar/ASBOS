            "Thanks to asus ,this is a very nice laptop.It's display is awesome.No confuse you will impressed by this awesome oled display.Battery backup is enough to use (apprx. 6-8 hr of normal use,browsing..).It comes with harman kardan dts sound ,which is loud and give a new experience.build quality also nice.I purchased i3 processor but it also very powerful,\nI purchased i3 processor at 46k but, if its cost would be 50k then also i will give it 5 star.No exception this is the best laptop about 50k at this time.\nGo for it !",
            "Pros - 1) Bright oled display as there is no backlight it reduces eye strain\n2) adequate total 4 usb ports, soft keyboard\n3)get asus power manager from windows store and keep settings at 60 percentage to reduce number of battery charge discharge cycle\n4) good for web browsing with tab sudpender extension i can open upto 150 tabs.\n5) excellent value for money as last year 15.6 inch oled laptop is to cost more than 1 lakh.\n6)good n loud dts sound with stereo mix and enhancement. I use voicemeter banana to drive multiple external speakers.\n7) very fast usb 3.0 copy from external pocket hdd\n8)fast boot up time n fast fingerprint sensor and fast hibernate.\n9)soon windows 11 drivers will be released by asus\n10) oled saver, pixel shift n refresh can be configured from myasus app\n11) battery drain is less, core i3 11 gen is same performance as core i7 8th generation i m using for office laptop\n\nCons- no speed control of cpu in battery power plan i use granola power manager for the same\nNot able to go to bios inspite of pressing f1 n f2 furing startup\n16gb memory model should be available for core i3.\nNot able to connect external 4k display using usb type c port adapter..need to use hdmi port.",
            "This laptop is insane. its single core cinebench r23 score is higher than some very high end cpu's (1200) because of high clock speed. Display is super bright and speakee is super loud.Battery performance is also decent, i saw a movie of 3 hour duration with 80 percent brightness and using bluetooth earphone baterry dropped only 30 percent. so i guess i would get atleast 6-8 hour battery backup also it charges 100 percent under 1.5 hours. wifi 6 and Bluetooth 5 works just fine. my asus is very helpful.\n\nPros- Powerful cpu, Gorgeous display, loud speaker, nice battery, good built , fast fingerprint scanner , fast charging, bezzels are small\ncons- only issue is heating because of high cpu speed which you can control using throttlestop and disable turbo so your cpu won't go beyond 3 Ghz which will reduce temperature and save your battery as well.\nNote- dont judge display with the image i have provided.",
            "Amazing laptop , I'm just awestruck seeing the oled display \ud83e\udd29 , smooth performance , design is perfect & I'll update abt the battery backup after using for some days . Once again , display is just alluring .",

It takes less than 3 seconds to open. If you restart the lap you can't see it's shutdown and restart it simply and on all in seconds.\n\nYou can blindly buy this laptop its awsome.\n\nAm giving this review after the two days of usage I will give more things later with images.\n\nAnother thing want to say that it's not 220 nits it's 400 nits but if you find anywhere it's given 220 nits display.\n\n\nNote my cons :\n\nAm giving review after one month of usage\n\nMy touch got problem from beginning guys if have the same problem replace immediately.\n\nI got this prob from beginning and after the complaint to the asus they said driver prob and to update I saw updates and updated everything done, after that also the same problem exists after the one hour usage or sometimes from starting the touch pad won't work properly the mouse pointer will dance up and down also from the centre of the touch pad it won't work.\nIt worried me lot in this updation i thought the problem is solved but not solved so the replacement date crossed. After that again i made a compliant they authorised to service center they came to my site and changed my touch pad, after the I also the problem remains same but this time touchpad little okay because it worked in centre but the mouse pointer dancing prob and slow moving sometimes the pointer won't move even the same problem.\nAgain I made complaint and asked for replacement they are refusing to do that they said they will change any parts in the laptop but not replacement.\nAm worried lot because I brought this lap for the purpose of work and now am spending time to customer care.\nThis is the only problem with my lap I don't know this problem is for everyone but it came for me.\nOther things were awsome in this laptop.\n\nIf the customer care replaced my laptop I will be happy.",

However would like to try and help if you still are on the verge of decision making.\nSo, if you love a great crystal clear bright display, spend lot of time binge watching movies or series and are ok to spend some extra bucks, this laptop is for you. Just go for it! You will not regret. It may be a tad slower (boot up) when compared to similar configuration models but makes up more than enough for it with its display.\n\nOnly challenge I faced was to upgrade to win11, had to do a clean install even though this laptop meets all the requirements.\nAlso, I got a cracked display in the box so had to get a replacement. So be careful when unboxing.\nHope this helps.",
