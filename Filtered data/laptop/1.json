            "First of all the design is superb. Its compact and looks sturdy. The body gives the feeling of a premium laptop.\nThe display is excellent. 100% sRGB with 300nits brightness. Not even the top laptop brands are giving that in this price range.\nKeyboard is OK with backlit. The backlit is not even through out but it's justifiable.\nSpeakers are really loud. You won't have any problem in watching movies. Listening to music is another joy.\nBattery is superb. I used the laptop for more than 4hrs and there is still 43% battery remaining.\nPorts are decent in number but they are a little bit tight but not a deal breaker.\nCharging speed is very good with type C to type C cable.\n8GB Ram and 256GB NVMe ssd combination is good. It comes with i3 10th gen dual core processor which is sufficient for normal tasks like web browsing, online classes, office apps, watching movies etc.\nNot suitable for playing games.\n.\nThis is my review after 1 day of use. This laptop is highly recommended for basic tasks.\nDon't let the brand name fools you. It's a very good product.",
            "1.First Flipkart Love it \u2764\ufe0f Very Fast Delivery \ud83d\ude9a\n\n2.Design a no.1 top notch\ud83d\udc4c\n\n3.Display viewing Angle its Good \ud83d\udc4c\n\n4.Battery Good \ud83d\udc4d\n\n5.Performance It's Good \ud83d\udc4c\n\n6.Price Very Good \ud83d\udc4d\n\n7.Overall Good Price and Nice Laptop \u2764\ufe0f\n\n8. The Trackpad Performance. Is Very \ud83d\ude14 bad\ud83d\ude21\nAny Time 3to5 time's tuch do it's a bad one\n\n\nThis price point \ud83d\udc49 good \ud83d\udc4d\u2764\ufe0f",
            "The design and build quality seems premium. The size is smaller than average laptops as it is 14inch. Note that it is made in China, although the brand is of Hong Kong.\n\nThe keyboard is very easy to use and spacious. Track pad is good but the trackpad buttons sometimes need to be pressed 2-3 times to click.\n\nSame goes for the power button, it never turns on in a single press. The power button light is also blue which for me is very difficult to notice. It should have been normal white light.\n\nThe screen is nice. Sound is superb. Lightweight and small size are good for portable use.\n\nThe laptop lid cannot be opened with a single hand. Use one hand to keep the laptop base down and other hand to open the lid.\n\nThere are sufficient ports to use but no CD drive. The charge cable received is type-C, but the cable is not very long. Also there is one AC power port which i dont know how to use as there is no cable provided for it. If someone knows then please tell me.\n\nOverall it is good. The only problems i have are with the trackpad buttons and power button.",
