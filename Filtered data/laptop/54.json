            "From past 10 months I'm searching for a best Gaming Laptop. Today I found it and I can say my choice is perfect. Mind-blowing Gaming Laptop at a reasonable price. Very fast booting(with in a blink of eye). Many people have a dream to become a gamer.. but due to high price everyone cannot afford a gaming laptop. But MSI made it possible with this low price and high specifications. Without any second thought we can buy it. I had a few doubts about the laptop and msi customer service cleared all my doubts without any hesitation in a easy manner. 5 \u2b50 for MSI Customer service. RTX 3050 and 144hz display grabbed my attention towards this laptop. So far the performance I got with this laptop Is beast. I also upgrade to windows 11 with no cost (Free). I'm very happy that MSI provided free Windows 11 upgrade. I'm happy to be a member of MSI. Thank you MSI \u2764\ufe0f. MSI (TRUE GAMING).",
            "First thing first laptop is having awesome performance there is no doubt on that . Reviewing after 15 days with 15 pros\n1.RTX 3050 DDR6\n2.SSD P.S-512GB\n3.2933 Mhz DDR4 RAM\n4.i5 10th Hexa Core processor\n5.51Whr 3 cell\n6.WiFi 6 bt 5.1\n7.8 gb of ram and guess what upgradable upto 64 gb.\n8.144hz display optional obviously\n9.Dragon Center and Msi App Player\n10.120w charger in the box\n11.GF-63 Thin so you literally gonna love its weight its far light weight.\n12.Around 5 hour of battery life with moderate use.\n13.4.5 Ghz clock speed kidding me.\n14.Really Cooler and having all port you need.\n15.Most important only on 58,740 all thanks to BBD\n\nI am not writting essay here but still it has some cons .\n1.Red backlight may some need saridon.\n2.512 gb ssd isn't pretty enough storage but for this price range considerable.\n3.Battery backup while gaming, poor actually.\nOrher than this in this price range what else you need rashmika :) no offense..",
            "Received this just a few hours back. The things I noticed after some light usage like browsing and installing applications are-\nPros:\n1. SSD is fast. I've used only HDD before so this was the first thing I noticed.\n2. Temperatures are usually <60C for both GPU and CPU for light use. Note that this has only one fan but it is unbelievable how cool this system stays even in no air conditioning rooms.\n3. Pretty lightweight. Just marvel at how much this is packing but in so little space.\n\nCons:\n1. The material is so bad. Like the build quality is ok but it is a fingerprint magnet. Collects so many fingerprints that it can be used for official work.\n2. The keyboard doesn't have numeric pad. It is clearly mentioned in the description and the pictures so no complaints from msi side but still I miss it. It needs some getting used to but typing experience is decent-ish.\n3.The backlit keyboard light is hard on eye. But it can be disabled.\n\nI will update this review once I put it under some heavy load tomorrow.",
            "After testing 3 days\n\nMy points of views\n\nPros\n1. Gamings performance is so good considering price, you will not find the same performance laptop in this range. \ud83d\udc4c\n2. Crispy display.\n3. Advanced BIOS by MSI for overclock , on software side its really good. You will get the other preloaded msi apps which i find useful for day to day task.\n4. Chasis is good. Thin and elegant.\n\nCons\n1. Power cord port should be in back, it is in left side of laptop.\n2. Single fan but thermal is good.\n\nConsidering the price i find it really good, it performing up to my expectations \ud83e\udd0d",
            "The machine is quite powerful and runs AAA titles upto 2018 effortlessly for normal usage. I don't stream or have massive external monitors, so can't say much about those scenarios... But if you're looking for a machine that does what it says by its own hardware, this is a simply a great investment. Also runs CAD/CNC software no problem.\n\nOne heads up: do NOT install the latest nvidia drivers from the Nvidia website.\nOnly download (if needed) the recommended Nvidia drivers from the MSI website.\n\nFor more info, the MSI website has a good FAQ for most of your questions so do check that out once.\n\nAnd yes, you CAN upgrade the RAM and Hard drive/SSD WITHOUT voiding the warranty. The factory seal sticker on the bottom lid is only to tell you that it hasn't been opened before you got it.\nThis upgrade/warranty info is from MSI's website (Q.18 in their FAQ), and it still states that if you screw ANYTHING up while doing the upgrade (yourself), that damage will be on you and obviously NOT be covered under warranty. This is a no-brainer so don't go yelling to MSI about it, in case you botch the upgrade.",
            "Cons :-\n1st - Doesn't support HDMI output through NVidia GPU but only through Intel GPU, so can't play games on bigger screen\n2nd - Thermals are pretty average, since MSI decided to show 2 fans in pic but in reality it only has 1 fan, Shame on you MSI for falls advertisement.\n3rd - GPU is severely underperforming even for a 3050 thanks to it being limited to 40 Watt TDP, 3050 can have max TDP of 80 Watt and achieve much higher clock speed, 60-65 Watt power should have been fine with 2 fans and an AC-Adapter of 135/150 Watt instead of 120 Watt.\n4th - 120 Watt AC adapter just isn\u2019t enough, while gaming your battery will slowly drain cause AC-Adapter alone isn\u2019t able to keep up with the power-draw.\n5th - You can feel a soft ting of static-electricity while hard pressing a key on side, if your skin comes in contact with internal part of chassis while typing with AC-Adapter on, I would say anti-static paint job wasn't done well in key-holes on chassis.\n6th - Don\u2019t have access to HDD/RAM port without opening the whole case and voiding the warranty, if you want upgradability in future then only buy it you have an MSI certified service center nearby, but MSI have pretty bad coverage compared to other brands, they only good service for Delhi/Mumbai/Bengaluru etc.\n\nPros -\n1st - 10500H is beast of a processor with 6 Cores/12 threads, performance is easily comparable to an i7, also don\u2019t go for MSI GF63 Thin with i7-10750H/RTX 3050 cause that CPU is even more power hungry and would leave even less wattage for RTX 3050, thanks to MSI giving same 120 Watt AC adapter with that one as well, again shame on you MSI.",
            "Great product by MSI at a steal price will run most of current AAA titles at high or mid settings.\nPros :-\n- Best deal for its price.\n-RTX 3050\n-Hexa core i5 10500H\n-2 year warranty\n-Great optimization by MSI\n-Light weight is a add on advantage for students\n-All of that for 58k is rare to find.\nCons :-\nCan't ask more for the price but battery life improvement and a rgb backlit would be appreciated.\n\nOverall happy with the purchase.",
            "Best in this price range",
            "Who ? And Why ?\n- If your Budget around 65k\n- You need laptop for daily work / studies and occasional gaming (720p / 1080p)\n- enough power for multitasking (6 cores / 12 threads)\n- good looks\n- medium work load (can run VMs, docker, integration servers etc - I am not talking full prod environment but you can present POCs)\n- video editing is possible 1080p - v easily can do almost anything. 4k - u can do basic if you add multiple layers then timeline will lag\n- games tested\nSkyrim special edition\nGTA - on high settings\n- 144hz screen\n- loud speakers\n- SSD storage\n\nso...so-\n- battery is ok - u can adjust performance in dragon center and calibrate battery\n- thermals are ok\n- Ram 8 GB\n\nLookout for -\n- color reproduction is not accurate\n- cooler booster 3 system is single exhaust meaning there is shared heat pipe between cpu and gpu\n- comes with windows 10 Home edition key installed on board. Windows 10 home is pathetic first thing\nYou need to do is install 10 pro. and reinstall drivers and softwares from msi, nvidea website - so u need some basic skills to use this machine to the fullest",
            "I needed the best performance and a good display at budget and I guess I have made a very nice decision \ud83d\udd25\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udcaf, This thing is a beast !!! Gaming and 1080p video editing is such a delight in this machine. WELL DONE MSI !!!",
            "I literally loved the product at the price point I have bought it during BBD. I just found one issue with my charger, It produces little bit earthing an as laptop is also made up of metal, it feels little earthing like touch all over. May be I can live with it.",
            "One of the best laptops, got it on sale and couldn't hope for anything better. The battery is a little bit on the lower side, but the display, performance, sound and the freedom to tweak the settings as per consumer's requirement is just amazing. The build quality is fantastic though there can be smudges. I was quite skeptical about the fan sound but it isn't too much as several other reviews have said, also on using headphones you won't hear any disturbance from that. Gaming and productivity wise it is absolutely amazing as long as you are not a competitive gamer.",
            "Works effortlessly in most of the aaa titles.\nPlayed rdr2, Ac valhalla and it gave stable 40-50 fps on med-high settings. Battery backup and thermals could have been better. Otherwise, a great deal at under 60k.",
            "First of all thanks to Flipkart and MSI for providing such a machine at 59K during sale period.\nDisclaimer:\nI'm a professional editor and my review will based on productivity usage and not gaming.\n\nIve been using this laptop for about a month now, and during the period I've used it in many scenarios such as on location during shoot for basic data transferring and proxy creation to editing rough cuts while travelling in a train. And overall I love this laptop. For the price I bought it, I can't think of any other better option as of now.\nNow let's get objective and present pros and cons of this machine:\n1. It is light weight and thin for a gaming laptop. My 4 year Asus ROG weighed 2.8kgs and carrying that around was pain in the back. But this thin laptop at 1.8kgs feels like nothing.\n2. The Hexa core I5 along with RTX 3050 give beautiful performance, frankly while editing 6k footage from Blackmagic cinema camera I didn't miss my main workstation. Davinci Resolve loves this laptop.\n3. This laptop allows you to upgrade the RAM to 64gb, by next year I'll probably utilise it.\n4. 144hz screen makes the day today task feel really smooth, I know it means alot for gaming but for me the smooth scrolling and dragging is just buttery.\n5. Speakers are decently loud and clear, exceeded my expectation.\n6. I love the fact that MSI didn't waste any ports on USB 2.0, all the USB ports support 5gbps.\n7. Webcam quality is pretty good. In normal room light the footage is clean and microphone along with Nvidia broadcast app is simply excellent with AI based noise cancellation.\n8. In Delhi, Service centre guys are super cooperative, I visited one near my house to get RAM and HDD upgraded, they did it smilingly. Try to visit HP or Lenovo for the same job, they'll give you thousands of excuses.\n9. 2 years warranty makes the whole deal sweeter.\n\nNow some cons:\n1. While doing heavy duty tasks the keyboard area warms up alot. My old laptop didn't have this issue, physically it was pretty thick and allowed better cooling option. Maybe the thin form factor limits the heat dispersion via fans, MSI could improve it in the next iteration. Please Note that there's no dangerous overheating.\n2. No 10 gbps usb port. It was very strange that MSI didn't include 10gbps port, it's 2021 and almost every gaming laptop above 50k has atleast one 10gbps port.\n3. MSI should offer better display option as this screen is colour inaccurate. An option for 100%srgb or 90% DCI p3 would have made this laptop perfect for creators. I mean I'm still ready to pay an extra 5-6k for upgrading to a better display.\n4. Laptop drivers are a bit unstable, there were times when I was just using Word and excel but for no reason discrete GPU ran in the background and battery went from 100 to 20 in 1.5hrs. On some good days I managed to watch Prime video for 5 straight hours on battery because internal gpu was active. MSI needs to fix this.\n\nIn all its a great machine for the price. Would recommend it even at 65k as it's powerful and light. Great job MSI.",
            "This is a great gaming laptop. I\u2019m not a hardcore gamer but it suits my needs. If you\u2019re looking for a casual gaming laptop that preforms as well as the more expensive brands this is a great pick. The graphics are crisp, sound quality is better than I expected and it connects easily with headphones and wireless mouse. I would recommend a full size keyboard for the laptop.",

The idle temp was also super chill at around 50 degrees.\nThe games i tested were Gta 5, Control & Plague Tale innocence all at ultra. Although for the best frame rates notch it bit down to high settings or medium for AAA titles.\nI personally think, in this price range and with the brand name of MSI, this laptop is worth the buy.\nI got it for 59k @ big billion days sale.",
            "Though this machine is good but have a drawback, it has only dedicated graphics card output. If something went wrong with graphics card. Then display will not work on iGPU.

            "Let me start by saying this is not my first gaming laptop, this is the 3rd gaming laptop in my family, and the second MSI laptop in my family, have a Asus ROG G551jk which was My 1st gaming laptop , then a MSI GP75 Leopard 9SE-485IN which was bought in dec 2019, because of which I decided to go for another MSI Laptop which is this laptop \"MSI GF63 Thin i5 with Rtx,\n\nPros\n1).this laptop is a beast. I am able to run all the latest games without any problems, the performance of the laptop is awesome, not able to find difference in performance when put side by side with the \"MSI GP75 Leopard 9SE-485IN\"\n\n2).screen is bright and vibrant colors, 144 hz screen is just what you need for gaming, just awesome.\n\n3).the ram is upgradable upto 64gb ddr4 which is good.\n\n4).heat management is good on this laptop\n\n5).already windows updated to windows 11\n\n6). rendering works superbly as I use this for work \"sketchup v-ray\"\n\n7). sound is good and inbuilt mic is also good, people noticed the difference when I spoke ingame and also on discord, they were like you sound clear and asked if i changed my headset.\n\ncons\n1). considering this is not my 1st gaming laptop and unboxing experience, and also not my 1st MSI Laptop, my unboxing expectations was very high, so I received the laptop and to my surprise it was just the laptop and the charger in the box nothing else, with made me very disappointed, other laptops which I got previously the asus rog, the MSI GP75 Leopard 9SE-485IN had goodies like, gaming mouse, gaming headset, and a proper carry bag, now I carry this MSI Laptop in my Asus laptop bag to work -_-,\n2). no RGB keyboard only red backlight keyboard\n3). the logo on the lid does not illuminate\n\nSummary\nif all you are looking for is a capable laptop all rounder for gaming, work etc in 2021, then look no further, performance 5 Star, looks 4.5 Stars\n\nI would recommend this laptop",
            "Great laptop. Bought it for 63k on sale. Cpu's great. Gpu could have been better if it used more than 40 watt. Battery not great. 3 hour backup on all battery saving options on. It's using hynix 8gB 3200mhz ram which is sadly clocked at 2933mhz. Bought another 3200mhz 8gB ram for it. It has kingston nvme m.2 ssd. Don't know why fps is low on valorant. Avg -140 fps. Intel has done a good job on this 10500h cpu. It took me 2 hours and 6 minutes to install Red dead redemption 2 (DODI repack). Overall good laptop must go for it under 65k.",
            "Gifted this to my brother and touchwood its going fine till now. Hopefully everything is well as of now, was really sceptic as i have never placed anything online that too an expensive thing. Well done flipcart",
            "First off all the delivery was fast and perfect.\nDid all performance and basic tests, everything came out just good.\ni5 10th gen especially 10500h is great with the best single core score compared to other competitors at the same price range and may be above.\nRTX at this price even though it's 40w it outranks other gtx variant at this price range with ray tracing and dlss option.\n\nThe only thing I was concerned about is the thermal but with the cooler boost 3 on it gives me steady clock speed above 4100 mhz and a safe temperature below 75 celcius (sometimes it dropped below 40 celcius), Though the fan sound is a thing.\n\nOverall I'm happy",
            "Have you ever watched the movie 'Beauty and the beast'? Well this laptop by MSI is a beauty as well as a beast.\ni5-10500H along with the rtx 3050 4gb graphics works as smooth as butter. (As the i5-1500H has 6cores and 12 threads there won't be any bottleneck issues). We get a 144hz refresh rate screen, that too with an anti-glare display with 45% NTSC color gamut. At this price it's more than enough. The webcam could have been improved a bit, but well a lot of gaming laptops are doing away with the webcam.\nComing to the battery backup, it gives you 5 modes through the dragon centre (gaming mode 2.0) and you can also customise it to your needs. The maximum single charge return that I got was 8 hours (super battery + battery saving mode), and it's fine with me, considering that this is a gaming laptop.\nThe dual speaker is decent and gives a good sound experience. You can again customize it according to your needs through the Nahimic software.\nThe built of the laptop is good, and the top lid as well as the keyboard (Steelseries keyboard) doesnt have a lot of flex issues. In fact its the bare minimum.\nWith this laptop one will get the latest Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.1 l, so you will be sorted regarding the connectivity. Also remember, along with this laptop you will be getting a free Windows 11 update.\nOne will get a 1x Type-C USB3.2 Gen1 and 3x Type-A USB3.1 Gen1 ports, 1 RJ45 port as well as a HDMI port.\nAlso I got a 2 years warranty with this laptop so it's a Win-win. The ram can be expanded till 64 gb and we also get extra slot for a hdd.\nSo considering all this, the laptop is quite good at the price range and is suitable for gaming as well as productivity.",

AND NOW IF I REALY WANT TO WRITE SOME CONS I WOULD SAY Trackpad is small and make sounds if you tap on it and my friend just bought realme book ,that one's trackpad is great but I would say go don't go for that one as compared to this,surely others things will kill that macbook lite \ud83d\ude02 and I can't figure out other cons everything seems to be great so far.",

            "I bought this at 58K during BBD sale, and it justified the price.\nIn the said price range, it is very competetive and affordable machine. I'll list the areas which I feel could be improved later in the review.\n\n1. 144HZ monitor - Awesome\n2. It is very light\n3. Build Quality is OK, does not feel cheap.\n4. Thermals - As soon as CPU Temp reaches 80, it comes down automatically. Same is for gpu too, but the temperature threshold for GPU is above 80 degree Celsius. Heat will not be noticed while playing.\n4. 3050 - despite being 40W, 4GB I played Hunt Showdown and Deadside both on highest setting and managed to get more than 60fps with refresh rate of monitor 144HZ. Everything is so smooth.\n\nNow things that can be improved:\n1. Brightness is less as compared to other laptops\n2. GPU sometimes suffer when the CPU temperature reaches 80\u00b0. You may feel kind of lag for few milliseconds when the hardware brings down the temp of CPU, but this can be ignored\n3. Trackpad tap is kind of ugly and clutter, use usb or wireless mouse\n4. We have to visit service center in case anything goes wrong or if we wish to upgrade RAM/ SSD/HDD\n\nOverall, for 58K this is the best bang for buck. Also, I missed to mention that both of the above games recorded on highest settings using OBS at 144HZ refresh rate at 60FPS if you are into game recording. I haven't yet checked the streaming but I think it will be smooth. I was tired of waiting for the GPU price to come down and it seems till 2023 there is no hope sadly, hence I bought this one and this really works for me (playing games, recording)",

Overall, I am very satisfied with the performance and display, only two things that are stopping me from giving it 5 stars are battery backup and body of the laptop which easily gathers finger prints",

            "The laptop is surprisingly capable for the intended tasks of gaming mid and high end games even though it has a lower watt Rtx 3050 GPU. Though it has only one fan, it makes up by providing options of cooler booster which does its job very well. It is well priced and good looking. It is a bit of a finger print magnet but that is not a major issue.",

            "Performance: i was able to play games likes valorant and cs flawlessly. So no issues\nHeating: Every gaming laptop heats, so keeping that in mind, the thermals were good.\nThe Only thing i would like them to improve is speakers, they're good but I expected them them to be a bit louder.\nConcluding, it's a good laptop at this price point, you can go for it.",

            "The product is good and delivers what it promises only one issue is that it has single fan setup while in product description it states it has dual fan setup. Also the chasis heat up a bit on the escape key part. Overall the product is excellent and best value for money. It is light and has good build quality and best value for money laptop.",
            "Used for 2-3 days, performance is great, display is awesome, Ram is less but it's upgradeable, CPU and GPU are perfectly matched in performance so they don't bottleneck each other, battery life is good for a gaming laptop although I wouldn't recommend gaming on battery.\nFactory seal is big down point because without breaking that one cannot perform any upgrades. This is a very negative point for msi as it's known for gaming laptops so they should be easily upgradable.\n\nAll in all a good, value for money, entry level gaming laptop",
            "Design and Build:\nExcellent build. Slim profile for a gaming laptop. Keyboard is very nice with only Red Backlighting. Trackpad is bit small but that's okay for a gaming laptop.\n\nDisplay and Speakers:\nSmooth 144Hz display for competitive e-sports titles. Don't expect color accuracy here. It purely meant for content consumption and not creation.\nSpeakers are really crisp with decent bass. Webcam is poor but does the job.\n\nBattery:\nBattery is okay. One thing to note, if your battery drops below 100% and you immediately connect the charger, the battery won't charge. You have to discharge the battery below 80% then only charging will happen.\n\nPerformance and Upgrade:\nPerformance for the price is top notch. Don't listen to people saying it has only Rtx3050 with low TDP and go with numbers. Leave those people aside. You will have no problems in gaming. Tried Warzone, Fortnite, The Division 1 & 2, RDR2. Everything plays perfectly. Use a cooling pad while gaming as it heats near the WASD keys. Basic code compilation and designing apps work flawlessly.\nThere is a free 2.5 inch HDD/SSD slot and RAM can be expanded to upto 64GB. But you will LOSE WARRANTY! Since you have to break the warranty sticker to perform upgrade.\n\nALSO DON'T LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE SAYING BAD THINGS ABOUT THE CPU OR GPU! THIS IS A REALLY GREAT LAPTOP FOR THE PRICE.",

I bought at last big billion days till now no issues I played aaa games like valorant ,gta 5 ,resident evil 6 at high graphics, no lag till now. But the only problem is GPU usage is low if we make that gpu to use more this will be beast .... I completely recommend it . Can anyone know to boost GPU usage kindly mention .",

            "Pros :\nGreat looks\nGreat performance\n144 Hz display\nNice build\nValue for money\n\nCons :\nBattery life is too low. On balanced power option it lasts roughly 3.5 hours with chrome on.",
            "Definitely a good mid ranger with gaming performance.\n\nBuilt: Plastic but sturdy built, good ventilation (it doesn't heat near keyboard and touchpad). Thin for a gaming laptop. Doesn't look much premium (Mac user here, opinion might me biased)\n\nPerformance: Does play most current AAA titles with minimal gitter.\nNote: The gpu is set to use 40w max, I might overclock it later. Also another 8gb dual channel RAM would be great.\n\nScreen: Fast screen with 144hz refresh rate, Good for gaming.\nDon't expect picture quality as of a retina display. Anti glare is not that great, so outdoor use might be a bit troubling.\n\nBattery: Decent enough, its a gaming laptop don't expect much in the first place. I love the fact that it comes with Dragon center pre-installed. It has options to select optimum settings for overall PC performance and hardware health.\n\nOverall if you're looking for a mid ranger laptop for indoor Gaming it the best at the price(around 62k).",
