            "I was planning to purchase Apple MacBook but Flipkart offered me this best in class laptop on Valentine's Day sale @44k with no cost emi...\nFull HD display\nAwesome sound\n2gb graphics\n8GB ram best for GTA 5 players\nSystem boots within seconds due to SSD apart from 1TB storage\nFigure print sensor\nBuilt quality, premium quality\nOriginal windows 10\nThank you Flipkart for such a great deal",
            "First of fall, I bought this laptop for 45K.\nThis is a OUTSTANDING LAPTOP for 45K.\n\n.\n=> BUILD QUALITY\nMetal build, feels premium and quite heavy too though it weights just 2.1KG.\nTrack pad has really good response and large enough (supports gestures). Also having a Fingerprint, though its not good as your phone's one. Also have a backlit keyboard.\n.\n=> PERFORMANCE\nBoots up in 10-13 secs , thanks to 128 ssd.\nOpens Photoshop CC 2017 in 10 secs approx.\nPlaying GTA 5 on Normal settings, Some noticable lags are there though.\nAlso gets heats up very fast during gaming cause of metal body , Fans are below display but display won't get much heated although keyboard got heated on upper side.\n.\n=> DISPLAY\nGot a Full HD 1080p Display with good viewing angles (Better than my friend's HP pavilion). Brightness is low for if you are using in direct sunlight. Screen is very reflective for outdoor use But looks good too in indoor condition, as it having a pure black screen.\n.\n=> BATTERY\nJust okay okay. Normal use 5 Hrs approx.\nGaming 45 Mins( approx) .Plug power in while gaming.\n.\n=>FINAL VERDICT\nGo for this if available near 50K, best deal. But I don't suggest this for 70K.\nFor further information or queries, contact me via Instagram- @govind.2",
            "Anyone who want to upgrade to class one... I they must go for Acer swift 3, 2018 edition... I it is more than a Mac PC... Mac comes with SSD feature only, Any other model in windows come with Only SSD or HDD .. This Acer swift 3 is mixture of SSD& HDD,+2GB graphics... At most lowest price it is available ... If the same features were in MAC or other brand windows and doors and price will be more than 90000RS,, It is most cheapest class-1 laptop... I recommend, better and better for work, grapghics, education",
            "Wonderful Product! Can become a very high end laptop if we upgrade with nvme pcie SSD. It comes with 128 GB m.2 sata ssd, even though it is fast. I have seen the feedback about screen is negative, guys it's an IPS screen and it's perfect with enough brightness. Very thin but not lite weight it's more than 2 kgs. Only the thing I am concerned about is the metal finish it is very slippery please make sure you are holding tight. I got it for 43k with some promotional offers applied and for that ...\nREAD MORE",
            "Hi Guys ,\nHere i am writing whatever i feel after using this laptop for 1 week\nfirstly i got this laptop on big billion day by 45k . And as per my opinion its a best deal at this price .\nhere i'm not going to talk about the specification because it already a labelled on product.\nbut still i am making a birds eye view as this product keep updating every month .this i m saying because when i visited it last time there is difference in\ndisplay which updates to 15.6 inches from 14 inch and one more update is it's screen its previous version doesn't have anti-glare screen but current version have.\n\nSo quick review of Specifications:-\nCore i5 8th Gen -\n(8 GB(DDR4 2400 Mhz)\n1 TB HDD/128 GB SSD(SATA)\n/Windows 10 Home/\n2 GB Graphics(Nvedia 150mx GDDR5) SF315-52G\nLaptop (15.6 inch, display Sparkly Silver, 1.8 Newton weight)\nIPS Screen with anti-glare ,\nkeyboard backlit\n,Finger print scanner,\n\nlets start with PROS:\n1)laptop is madeup of aluminium including all planes.which gives it premium sleek look.\n2)battery backup is good enough more than 8 hrs on normal uses.\n3)Speaker is loud enough but don't expect much as its a laptop not a home theater\n4)display Quality is good enough.\n5)keyboard is awesome.you will feel premium while typing something.\n6)back lit keyboard is good for non lightning condition.\n7)touch paid is enough sensitive.\n8)Good built quality.\n9)wide viewing angle due to IPS display and clear visibility in sunlight due to anti-glare\n10)camera is good enough but don't expect 4K\n11)its boot time is around 5 second. because of 128 GB SSD(SATA)\n\nCons:-\n1)laptop heat while gaming but its fine not that much\n2)although its only of 1.8 kg but still its feel like 3 kg of laptop due to metal finish.\n3)heat vent is present on bottom so little heat if you are directly use it on mattresses due vent block air. but soon\ncool as vent open .\n4)Ethernet port is missing.\n\ni haven't face any issue till 7 days of uses.And one thing that i wanna mention , please must buy acer 3 year extended warranty. while buys this laptop.or later you can register yourself within 7 days of purchase .\n\nthis laptop is best suited for CODDERS,official use ,and also for moderate gammer,\n\nits a best deal for a student having budget less than 50K.on offer time .\n\nthanks a lot to read it ,\nHave a great time.",
            "I've used the laptop for about 2 months now and I can say it's really good!\n\nPros\nInsanely fast bootup time. Not even 10 seconds to start the laptop from a shutdown state. Windows updates are also are over in no time at all.\nMetal build. That feeling you get when it has that cold metal touch when you take it out...\nPretty good graphics performance. Can play GTA 5 with moderately high settings pretty easily. Can't play it on Ultra graphics settings but if you want to do that, why are you looking at this laptop.\nLots of storage. 1 TB hard disk in addition to the SSD for storage and in emergency cases, when you can't install a big application on the SSD due to storage limitations, you can do it on the HDD.\nApplications run smoothly. For a test, I used Premier Pro to render a 10 minute 4K video at max quality and it took just 13 minutes! Miles ahead of my old laptop.\nJust the right weight for me. It sometimes feels surprisingly light.\n\nMeh\nHeat management. This is both a pro and a con. The laptop does heat up when playing heavy games or using resource-heavy applications but it stays mostly on the bottom part of the laptop and doesn't affect the keyboard area. But since the bottom can heat up a lot, it's advisable to get a stand or a cooling pad to raise the laptop bottom so the heat can dissipate properly. It stays cool most of the time otherwise when basic web surfing or anything like that.\nSpeakers are just ok. They can get loud but a bit more bass/low-end would make this the perfect laptop speakers for me. They could be a lot worse since it's just laptop speakers so can't complain much.\n\nCons\nBattery life!! Acer claims it can last for 10 hours but it barely lasts just half that! I tried everything I can find to improve the battery life but max it can last is about 5 hours when just web surfing and normal use. Average is just around 4 hours. This is much lower than I expected when I brought it. But if you turn off the display or close the lid like when you leave it overnight for downloading something, it can last close to 10 hours. So that's nice, I guess.\nBacklight bleed. I'm getting bleed from most of the screen edges and it really weakens the otherwise premium feel of the laptop. It doesn't affect normal use since you only notice it when you're staring at a black image like during startup or shutdown but it's there.\nWish the screen was more color-accurate. Now I have to manually calibrate it to get the right color but even then it isn't perfect. The Asus Zenbook has 100% SRGB gamut if you're looking for that and isn't much more expensive than this at the current price in Flipkart.\n\nAll in all, if you're looking for a powerful laptop that can handle heavy tasks, and which isn't too expensive (not the price right now. Wait for offers.) this is a very good choice for a laptop. It's not perfect but it gets the job done very well.",
            "Yes it's a very nice product. Got this swift 3 at 45K on this Valentine's day. It has each and every feature like a smart phone. It is somewhat slippery, feels heavy weight, looks are superb, running smooth, no ethernet port as it is thin laptop, It has SSD that's the nice point. It doesn't have dvd drive. Backlit keyboard is nice. It is may not be the best at 70K but can be at 58-65K like Asus Vivo book. Full metal build and warranty comes under ITW so warranty works only in Bangalore and Delhi. Overall great product thank u flipkart and ACER.",
            "Best laptop in range. Looks cool, processor does good job.\nDisplay is awesome if you don't mind the glossy panel and mx 150 does decent job in gaming(better get laptop with 1050ti or above for gaming). Sound is okay. Fingerprint is just bonus feature which is rare. Best suited for students with less than 50k budget.\n\nAnd only choose one with windows 10 as this comes with 128GB SSD which can handle it very well.",
            "45k its best deal\nAll are saying display is not grate but we can't even get a 1080p display at price 45k and display is glossy display looks excellent for this price.And antiglare voting is personal preference I don't like antiglare so I won't complaine about Display.price its not good for study because it's not antiglare and have less brightness.it fells like Mobile display it good for movies.\nU can't use it on outdoor\nIt has some lightbleding to but you won't notice\nSound is excellent for this price no words.\nPerformance csgo at 110 to 130fps on ultra i did'nt tried gta5 frames\nSsd helps a lot\nLot of blotware but can be uninstalled\nDon't worry of Itw warranty just follow the steps given below u Will get onsite warranty\nDownload Acer care app on(iOS or android)\nNext signup\nRegister a product and follow the steps as it says later it will ask snid turn back your computer and scan on that's stickers on the backside of the computer it will register your onsite one year warranty\nFells bit heavy\nBuilt quality is awesome\nFor this price ididnt find any con",
            "I am very lucky I got this laptop on big billion day and I am little bit confused about performance of this laptop but but after getting this laptop I can say this is the beast under 45k \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d just take this if it available under 50k .\ndesign of this laptop is new and aawsum from previous variant .\nit was totally new variant with all improvements from previous variant\n\npros\n- trust me design is really superb feel like premium\n-anti glare display\n-8gb ram\n-128gb ssd led to very fast book\n-really fast fingerprint\n-gaming performance - you can play gta 5 on higher setting on 30 to 40fps all game will run very smoothly\n-battery life if good if you are using battery saving mode it will last up to 7 to 8h on battery saving mode\n- aasum full hd display\n\ncons\n(wait i am finding some cons \ud83e\udd14)\n- and I didn't find any cons in my point of view\nbut for you me be a weight will be the issue\n\nI highly recommend this laptop under 50k it's a beast \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 and it is really very different from her previous variant .",
            "WRITING THE REVIEW AFTER 2 MONTHS OF USE:-\n-I got this lappy for 45k.\n-The performance is super fast as it contains SSD.\n-It boots up in 10 seconds.\nABOUT THE BATTERY- I can see a lot of negative reviews about battery, but trust me the battery backup is really really good.\nAm getting around 6 to 7 hours of backup while watching movies.\n- The game run smooth( i have played only pubg).\n(make sure not to apply heavy load and games for 2 weeks of purchase)\n\n-The display is very good. Sharp and clear.\n-It exactly looks like a Macbook.",
            "I was fortunate to get this laptop at 45k (windows). I was looking for a laptop with SSD that could do average gaming with the latest generation i5.\nConsidering the price at which I bought this laptop, it would not be fair to say that the screen is not upto the mark. It is IPS LED but is glossy and reflective. Apart from the screen, the other thing is that it doesn't have the extra slot for RAM.\nApart from these two things there are only pros in the laptop. At 45k this was the best I could get anywhere in the world. Value for money!!",
            "After lots of searching, I finally choose this laptop because of the paper specification.\nReason for buying the laptop - Latest System Configuration under 50K.\n\nLikes\n- Price - Its biggest advantage. No one is providing this specification at this attractive price.\n- Build Quality.\n- Storage - 128 GB M.2 SSD and 1TB 2.5\" HDD\n- Descent Performance\n- Display. ( Satisfactorily Good)\n\nAbout Storage Partition - There are two drive. First one is SSD (Windows installed here) and second one is HDD (Totally Free).\n\nAccording my need what i dislike about this laptop\n1. Battery backup - Not even the half as mentioned in specification. Getting around 4-4.5 Hrs even on normal usage.\n2. Weight - Feels really heavy. Even its 2 Kg Laptop but its feels like 3.5 Kg.",

            "I was looking for a mid range laptop for my office use to do some basic regular office stuffs.I had many options in 35-40K range with i5 processor and 4/8GB RAM. After going through few online research i just came across this Acer Swift 3 but the price was around 65K which wasn't the price segment i was looking for. But I just added it in wish list so that i may get it for a better price on Big Billion Day sale. When i check it later it was just 44,990 and it though it was 4-5K above my budget I booked it.\n\nAnd Kudos to Flipkart and Team they just delivered it on time and when I opened it,it was just awesome,\nWell packed, beautiful metallic built which gives very premium look,comes with inbuilt battery and when i power it on,it was just awesome, beautiful FHD IPS Display,nice keyboard layout and it didn't take even 15 seconds to boot up.\n\nAs it comes with 128GB SSD it's superfast,8GB RAM,intel i5 processor,1TB Hard Disk,15.6 Inch Full HD IPS screen with Gorilla glass protection and good battery backup.\nI got everything what i was looking for.\n\nYou can go for it without any second thought.\nGOOD DAY.",

            "Had horrible experience with delivery. I got out for delivery notification for three days, rescheduled my work to be at home (had to exchange with my old laptop), and no one came for delivery. Their customer service is good for nothing. In fact, their whole delivery model is flawed. Their out for delivery notification is valid for whole day, and they don't commit on time slot, so in most of the cases I have to waste full day to get my order delivered. Now I hesitate buying from the Flipkart because of their delivery model.\n\ncoming to the product, it has sleek metallic body that looks attractive (though on heavier side). Laptop turns on and shuts down within 10 seconds, a big thumbs up to SSD. 1080p is nice, so is audio. Did not try extensive computing yet, but configuration is good enough for day to day computing need. Definitely a grate value for money!\n\nCons : Speakers are placed on lower side so get muffled voice if laptop is placed on flat surface. There is no Ethernet slot.",

I bought it for my Deep Learning research work mainly, though its not one of the best, but it certainly serves my purpose and to play some FIFA during my free-time.\n\nThe only cons from my side are:\n\n1) There's no ethernet port\n2) No port for fitting projector.\n3) The backlit keyboard switches off automatically after some-time and you can't choose the duration of the lights to stay on\n4) Audio is average not that good\n\nAt the end of the day its worth the penny, as I got it for Rs. 45k because of Big-Billion day sale.",

It belongs to the ultra-slim series of ACER.\nSecond issue people say it has a poor battery backup.

It hardly lasts for 5hrs to 6 hrs.\nAnother thing those who have doubt about ITW, I can clear you about the concept.\nAll the Acer laptops initially have 1 year onsite warranty and the ITW(International Travellers Warranty) is the extra benefit you are having. Suppose you are going abroad and you face issues or your laptop gets damaged, in this situation you can visit ITW centre of that country. Likewise, if any foreigner comes in our country and he/she faces some issues he/she can visit our country's ITW centre.",

You just keep on mailing these guys but none of them will ever reply you back. And just within 2 months, my battery got dead and I complaint for it, and its been almost 14Days, But the battery is still not delivered from warehouse to Field technician,\n\nI highly recommend you all to stay away from Acer if you guys are planning to invest a bigger amount in a business laptop. Simply Go with Dell, HP or Apple because their support is amazing. They figure out any system issue within 3 to 4 days max.",
            "As a programmer, I would highly suggest that don't buy any laptop from ACER, this comes with tons of headache infact this is my genuine review after using it for more than 8 months and observing the same issues from other ACER users. Sometimes the battery charging will stop all of sudden, sometimes the keys won't work, sometimes the system will shut down unexpectedly and you will end up spending too much money on the hardware. I would suggest to go with a different brand if you are a avid user, because seriously you can't rely on this brand at all.",
