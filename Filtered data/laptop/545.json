            "Flipkart just took 2 days to deliver the product.\nI have used it now for just few hours, so here is the first impressions....\nBattery is great as of now.\nDisplay is great... vibrant and crisp.\ni3 11 th gen handles everything too easily.\nSSD is toooo fast...i have made a partition of 175gb for c drive.\nDesign is also great.\nComes with genuine windows 10 and ms office home & student 2019.\nAs of now.... everything is great. Now let's see what happens after some time, I'll edit the review after that.\n\nMy thoughts after almost 15 days of usage.\n\n1) battery- 4.5/5, definitely very good.\n2) sound quality - 3/5, very low & bad.\n3) display+ build quality+ processor+ssd speed + fast charging+ ram quality everything is great.",
            "Everything works with very fast speed due to i3 11th Gen, 8 Gb RAM and 512 Gb Nvme SSD. FHD display is awesome. Sound quality is also great. Light weight (only 1.4 kg). Battery performance is very good. Backlit keyboard and fingerprint sensor make it more valuable laptop.\n\n\u270d\ufe0f Surjya kumar Das, Assam",
            "Good morning.\nIt is a nice product.\nI used it for a day, and it is strong and muscular. Works just as a Bugatti but looks a bit like an Audi .\nYou can go for it if budget below 45000.\nBacklit keyboard is also strong and useful.\nFingerprint scanner is fast and powerful.\n\nSo go for it. But do a bit research befor buying .\n\nThankyou.",
            "Performance of the laptop is good. Login screen appears in ~9 seconds from power on. Fingerprint sensor works like a charm. Sound is ok.\n\nDisplay port/charging using Type C port is not supported. Laptop looks good but not satisfied with the build quality. Power button is integrated to keyboard and it looks like a normal key. Display quality is average.\n\nAfter initial setup laptop, it showed some sort of glitches. It was not turning on for a couple of hours. Later somehow it turned on and now its 1 week, as of no issues.\n\nAbout Flipkart's replacement policy: I deducted 2 stars for this. When i asked for replacement they said, a Flipkart's technician will visit my place after 2 weeks and on his approval they will start processing my replacement. I don't want to waste that much time, i cancelled the replacement request. I don't know how long this laptop will run.",
            "Very Good and better in that price Range .\nI ordered on 3 May 2021 and got delievered on 5 May 2021 ,only in 2 days.\nI got i3 11th gen 8GB RAM 512 GB SSD at only on 38990.\nBest laptop i ever got in this price range.\nPower plug and Adapter wire is also very soft and Adapter wire is long as sufficient .\nPackaging is also very good, it is available like a suitcase for the laptop.",
            "Got it 40k,and at that particular price it's just amazing...Went onn with many other models in this category but some or other features used to be missing...but asus gives us a laptop which fulfill all our requirements...\nCompact Design\nAwesome Speaker(Note- Initially the volume was low but later on called asus and then they guided me with an update after which sound got increased)\nVery Nice battery backup, additionally it shows how long the battery would go depending upon the usage.\nOmg! That Speedy Charging..Just 45min or less than that will go for 5-6hrs on normal usage..\nPre-installed Ms office is handy and reliable..\nCortana is mind blowing,very speed due to ssd,my asus app connects with laptop and we can share photos feasibly..\nVery Nice! Especially for coders,not for gaming purpose,small games would work very easily..",
            "It's a best laptop in this price range. I have bought this in summer sale for Rs38900.\n1. Talking about performance it is upto the mark.\n2. Battery backup is also good it give 7-8 hours backup if you are using continuously.\n3. Camera is also good, but it doesn't have privacy sutter.\n4.

It also have backlit keyboard.\n7 it has plastic body.\n\nWait to buy it if the price goes up above Rs. 40000",
            "It's best value for money laptop. Don't think about HP i3 11th because after 1 year HP will be slow definitely but not Vivobook. Battery is very good. Performance is awesome. Display is more awesome. Every thing is awesome in the budget range . You can buy it blindly. Its quite better than ryzen 5 3500u because it's a latest processor. I love it so much.",

And the speakers are also cracking voice (if you know what I mean) which is very annoying. I'm watching a movie and even if it's a silent scene with just air in background , the music cracks and that just ruins the whole experience. Aside from these two problems, everything seems to work just fine.",

Superb build quality, ultra fast response, fantastic features, hyper smooth functioning. You cannot get a better machine (branded) at this price. Go for it without a second thought!",
            "Just received the product today. While start up and shut down it takes a very small time compared to old models. The boot up time is quick. The Performance of the Device is pretty good at price range of 38.5K.\n\nI am writing about helping people extend the warranty at INR 99 for additional 1 year and INR 999 for additional 2 years.\nInstead of buying warranty from flipkart or ASUS app in the Laptop buy it from ASUSPROMO.IN.\n\n\nSome people have written about small laptop. But they should be ensured that it is a 14 inch screen irrespective of size of computer.",
            "Writing this review after 3 days. This laptop is amazing and working very good till now, laptop with these specs make itself a very Worthy product for students...I would definitely recommend it to buy if you're a student.It has met all my expectations but the issue why I gave it 4 - Stars was it's battery issue,, seriously believe me it drains quickly and gives you around 3-4 hours..Though I understand that there are always sacrifice and compromise in order to gain something better...overall it's a WORTHY LAPTOP...",
            "I am using the laptop from April. After heavy use of this laptop . I am giving the review . So you can prefer my review whether you should buy or not .\nFirst come to\nBATTERY \ud83d\udd0b\ud83d\udd0b\ud83d\udd0b - This laptop hardly gives 3.5 Hours of battery . It's Very disappointing thing . I am a student . And in my case battery backup is a major thing.\n\nPERFORMANCE - well performance is quite good . It will not disappoint you . Specially the SSD increase it's performance .\n\nSTORAGE AND RAM - I bought a version of 8gb Ram and 512gb SDD . BUT you will get only 6gb Ram for use and 2 GB uses the system . You will get only 472gb .\n\nGraphic card - I haven't do editing and play games . So I can't give review regarding this .\n\nDesign - Design is awesome \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d. And it's very light weight laptop. It's backlight good and senser makes it out of the box.\n\n\nNOTE - overall performance is quite amazing expect battery life \ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude14....\n\n\nYou can go for it surely but keep it in your mind regarding the battery life.",
            "Apparently, I'm running out of words to describe it so I've given rating. At first blush, I got fascinated with the backlit keyboard \u2728 that was so enchanting and then arrives the touch experience of the trackpad of the laptop, it was smooth as silk. Overall it's a worthy product at such an affordable price & a non-regrettable purchase in today's life. \u2764\ud83e\udd18",
            "Nice laptop . The look is awesome. Though plastic is used but it is a good quality plastic. The keyboard is very clicky and the backlit keyboard is extremely good. The photo that i have shared is the middle backlit u can go also one level up than that. Ya it is not for gaming. The display is also very good.",
            "I've brought this a week ago when only 11 ratings were there and it was 3.8 stars on average.\nThis laptop has the best looks and it's super easy toh handle as it is 1.4 kgs only. The charge stays well for like 4 and half hours. It can game a bit. The keyboard looks very cool. It has that premium feeling when you work on it. The booting time is like 4 or 5 secs. I got it for 39990.\nThe only drawback is that it doesn't have a lab port as it is a sleek book. Go for it.",
            "Hi all, I'm using this laptop for last few days. As I was looking for sleek laptop with good performance it satisfied both. Laptop design was really cool. Performance is good and fast. Really enjoying the experiance with this laptop. Value for money.",
            "Good display with decent viewing angles as well as battery backup. It is quick due to SSD and 8GB RAM, Camera is decent for an laptop. Keyboard is good. Fingerprint sensor is quick to recognize. Only thing which bothers me is it hinge. It is delicate and display part shakes a lot while typing in hand or kept under fan. Laptop is running cool so cooling solution is good compared to other laptops I used. Durability wise need to be very careful while handling. 8GB of RAM is good for now but there is no upgradability options so it will be like an mobile phone with fixed RAM and only storage can be upgraded.",
            "It's an amazing product in the range of 44k and specially it's good for multiple tasking and things and very fast things happen in secs. I would recommend everyone to buy this one if you have the budget of 44k kinda ..",
            "I bought this laptop 3 weeks back and it has been working brilliantly. Boot is super fast, display is awesome and the performance is unbeatable! I literally waited for this model for weeks and I'm happy I waited.\nWill update on the performance a month later.\nThe white colour variant is out of stock so you shouldn't wait and get the black one as at 39k this is the best laptop since all other laptops under this performance segment is around 45-50k.\nMy usage includes wfh and it has been serving me well. It's backlight too and the asus people gave some cute stickers which look super cute",
            "Dear Customers,\nPackaging from Flipkart was really worst, it was just packed in a box, bubble wrap could have been added to avoid shaking, overall disappointed with the packing.\nI'm really happy with this laptop, I have been using this laptop from past 20 days, laptop is really very fast due to i3 14th generation, 8GB Ram, 512 GB SSD, Clock Speed of 3.0 GHZ which boosts up to 4.0 GHZ etc.\nBacklit keyboard is very attractive, design of the laptop is awesome, battery backup is also very good, My Asus pre-installed app is also an advantage, Windows 10 home and MS Office home and student 19 are pre-installed, Mcfee antivirus comes with 1 year subscription, and Cortana artificial chatbot is also pre-installed which makes it stand out, overall it's a good laptop with this price range.\nI'm a working professional and also I'm persuing my Master's, so Asus Vivobook has helped with my professional work.\nSo I would like to recommend this product to those who are working professionally and also for the people who are looking to buy the laptop below 50 K.\nCheers to Asus Brand.",
            "Looks like a good laptop at first impression.\nWord, excel and PowerPoint is included with the laptop.\nWill update the laptop after few months of usage.",
            "The laptop looks awesome.\n\nVery fast shutdown and boot up.\n\nSound of the speaker is very clear.\n\nBattey backup could have been better.\n\nRam 4gb for CPU and 4gb for GPU.\n\nFinger print sensor very fast working.\n\nSSD drive work really fast.\n\nOverall Value for money for student and office usage.",

            "At 40k this is a good buy. As all competitors are not that great looking and portable friendly ( obviously no comparison to macbooks) though with similar specs. It has a good amalgamation of hardware and software.. the display is good but not that vibrant and the webcam needs improvement as with all others out there.. rest assured and enjoy the beauty in the beast.",
            "Laptop is good. But display is small. I also have LG laptop 14 inch and it's display is bigger than asus which is also 14 inch. LG laptop display height is 1 inch bigger. Also they should've provide num pad too and navigation key is too small not able to use properly. Battery backup is low. Performance is okay.\nNo dedicated key for volume. No bag with laptop. SSD helps for faster operating and booting.no Ethernet port. Body get scratches easily so take good care.not ideal for media consumption. Only for work\nAll this cons I have mentioned according to its price",

BATTERY : Only 2 to 3 hrs at max which is great disappointment at this price point. The claim of \"Long Lasting Battery\" is just absolute FALSE.\n\n2. SCREEN : it has little yellow tint and looks very dull.\n\n\nConclusion: Not at all worth at this price point. Go for HP",
            "The looks and the feel is spot on thought the processor is a lit on the slower side but it is value for money..\n\nAfter a month of usage- the laptop starts in less than 9 secs which is commendable. It offers 3 fan speed mode for better performance and you would hear absolutely nothing even during heavy usage.\n\nThe battery lasts about 5 hrs with backlight on and moderate usage which is a bit low but it's still absolutely worth it.",
