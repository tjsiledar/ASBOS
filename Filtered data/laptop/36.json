And the laptop doesn't heat much even if you're doing heavy tasks. Normal heating is observed, and the cooling fan is really silent.\n\nThank you ASUS and flipkart for this great value for money product!

            "Great product for personal use. Stylish and light weight, Ryzen 3 as a processor is fast and responsive. Booting time is 3-4 seconds. Sonic master is providing good sound quality, and nano edge technology is top notch. One stop choice for a budget laptop. ASUS did it!!",
            "Perhaps the best laptop in this price point. With the combination of Ryzen3 and 256 SSD, there\u2019s no beating this laptop by any other brand at this price. Maybe RAM needs to be upgraded after a couple of years when windows 11 upgrade becomes available. This is my 2nd ASUS and im extremely happy with the brands VFM products.",
            "Yess...It Is a Best Value for money option for the price range 30k-35k.\n> Display- Is FHD Great\u2705\n> Performance - AMD Rayzen 3 Processor with integrated graphics is capable of doing day-to-day office work like use Microsoft Office.\n> Students any can also do coding using this laptop.\n> Battery Backup - Good\n> From 256 GB of SSD ,about 180 GB of storage is usable.\n> 4GB of ram is ok for students to coding and for Microsoft Office",
            "This is a honest and a genuine review:-\nPros:- 1)Great Display\n2)Amd ryzen 3 3250u > Intel i3 11th gen\n3)Good for coding and to learn programming languages.\n4)Good for video editing and Photoshop\n5) Software included (ms office 2019 lifetime + 1 year McAfee antivirus.\n6) You can also play high end games but you'll face major frame drops so I don't recommend this for heavy gaming but you can play moderate games.\n7) Fingerprint sensor for faster access.\n\nCons:- 1)Very bad camera\n2) Battery backup is not that good you can get 3 hours of battery backup while coding or editing and 4-5 hours in normal usage (depends upon which software you're using )\n\nVerdict :- It's best laptop under 40k don't hesitate just buy it if you're confused overall experience is completely amazing",
            "Great laptop at the price range.\nGot it for 28k excluding 1k supercoins.\nLightweight sleek design, best part is nano edge FHD display!\nBoots in 3-5 seconds thanks to ssd storage and day to day operations are snappy fast!\nUi works like butter and comes pre-installed with windows 10 and ms office 15.\nFingerprint scanner is a good addition and adds an extra layer of security.\nBattery backup is decent and would give 6-7 hours without internet. 4 hours with wifi on.\nSound quality is also decent with speaker grills both sides below the laptop.\nComes with ram and hdd slots for upgrading!\nOverall best laptop found under Rs. 30k!",
            "I have been a fan of Asus for some years now. They have after all, pioneered expandable storage in ultra-slim laptops and give good quality configs at a budget price-point.\nThis model comes in that same bracket. But the experience of good components is spoiled by some glaring flaws in the design.\n\nPROs-\n- BUILD: Light and strong plastic.\n- LID AND HINGE: Smooth hinge (better than the creaky experience of my previous Asus). Attractive.\n- KEYBOARD AND BASE: Decent keyboard experience (not as good as the older Vivobooks, but better than Acer). Base is matte plastic and easy to open. No warranty seals.\n- PORTS: Good. 2xUSB 2, 1x USB3, 1xUSB-C, 1xHMDI, 1x3.5mm jack. NO SD/MicroSD.\n- SCREEN: Sharp, good brightness, easy view (matte). Good colour balance.\n- HARDWARE: Good quality. Speedy CPU, fast SSD (WD SN570). Works great with the given 4GB RAM (SSD is fast).\n- BATTERY LIFE: Good. Idle power usage is between 4-8W (so gives 4-6 hrs backup).\n\nCONS-\n- BUILD: Lid is prone to scratches. All else is good.\n- LID and HINGE: Hinge does not open wide. While the movement is smooth, the stop at the widest angle is not very apparent.\n- KEYBOARD and BASE: Keyboard is NOT backlit. And NumPad is 3 column (unlike 4 column of Dell/Lenovo).\n- PORTS: USB ports little tight.\n- SCREEN: No Cons\n- HARDWARE: Biggest cons here. First off- AMD drivers seem unreliable. I get BSODs almost every other day with a message \"Driver Power Delivery Failure\" or something like that. Never had a single BSOD in all my other laptops in Windows 10 (1st Gen i3 to 7th Gen i3). Also the cooling system is very inefficient (no heatpipe and a small fan blows over the CPU across the motherboard). This leads to high CPU temps and a noisy fan even in basic usage. This cooling system is now standard in budget Asus laptops (the ones with the vents on the left side). Not a good experience- affects usability, creates trepidation when putting the laptop to demanding tasks and may affect longevity of the hardware).\n- BATTERY LIFE: Cannot configure CPU speeds with windows power profiles. The newer Intel and AMD CPUs have a very low non-turbo speed (~1.7GHz), so you have to leave turbo on. So battery life is fairly unpredictable depending on how much turbo kicks in.\n\nSUMMARY- Better than other offerings in this range. But recommend skipping this price range and stepping up for better hardware, good cooling and latest CPUs.",

            "It is absolutely a value for money product.. But the build quality really feels a little tender. Viewing angles are better than most of the competition but the colors look cartoonistic and is not accurate, human skin subjects look paintish and over saturated. Performance somewhat degrades after updating to windows 11. It's better to stick with windows 10 if you want slightly better performance. Overall it's gud purchase.",

Much better than most in this price range\n\nOnly cons\nNo backlight keyboard\nDisplay not bright for outdoor use.
