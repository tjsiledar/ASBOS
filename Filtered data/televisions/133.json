            "I was worried about the colour production as mentioned contrast ratio is low. But in actual it's looks amazing.\nDolby Vision and Dolby Atmos really works in Netflix. It actually able to decode Dolby Atmos sounds.\nTuned the color settings as Contrast to 65. Brightness 50, Red +10, and backlight to 80. It will looks better than Vivid.\nScreen bleeding is there and it's easily noticable in a darker room.\nThis tv is ideal for day time and for use with brighter room as it's a IPS screen. For night watching any day a VA panel tv is better than IPS. Dual band wifi also works flawlessly with fiber.",

            "Worth every penny\n\nThis is my second moto tv.Earlier it was 43 inch .So this review is not after buying this tv infact it is after watching the earlier tv for 2 yrs .\nSound - It has Dolby Atmos sound ,if some someone needs woofer or bass than they have to buy speaker separately or else if somebody needs plain normal sound than it is more than enough.HD picture sound is more clear than SD .\n\nPicture - At this price and with this all features it is definitely worth . Picture quality is very clear ,but yes this tv is more better to watch HD channels or while using internet.Indeed it can't match Sony ,LG or samsung clarity(that's the reason they are very expensive) ,but rest can give tough fight to everyone.\n\nConnectivity - Very easy and soothing experience.All apps can be downloaded.\n\nService - We had face some panel issues in earlier tv but it got sorted with not much of headache.Would recommend to go for extended warranty as this all tv if In any reasons get disturbed than they give big Bills for repairs,not only this but LG , Samsung or anyone.\n\nStorage - many would not be knowing tht this tv has more ram and latest Android version than any other tv in smart segments.I think one plus only has got tht features in other brands.\n\nNow tv are as good as mobiles .Think you are buying moto mobile ,just go for it .
