All connectivities like Bluetooth, USB, WiFi, Hdmi are working smooth.\n3. Play store, Google Asst working good.\n4. Games with Game pad experience for kids is fine. But not tried with more games.\n\nCONS:\n1. Stand by time while switch on is taking time to show home page.\n2. Even this has Dts dolphy with 24 watt speaker, sound of this tv is really disappointed. Because I had panasonic with just 20 watt before this, delivered very good sound with base and volume in 12 points of volume. But in Moto zpro 43uhd, no base, no clear voice. So you should buy or should have additional sound bar or home theater with more than 50 or 60 watt speakers.\n\nFinal conclusion: If you will manage this with Additional sound bar for better experience, You can go for it without hesitation. Worth for money.",

I am clean bowled by the Yorker of Flipkart.\n\nNo word to praise it, friends...\nThe awesome sound bar and the bluetooth stand alone audio receiver function is outstanding.\n4K visuals and 4K/UHD visuals will make you fall in love with it over and over again.\n\nThe TV is fill of PROs and no CONs.\nI realize that it's a full paisa vasool TV...\nThank you Flipkart for such a great product.",
            "It's more of a family tv where elders can enjoy watching just the tv and young and kids can play. I liked the connectivity and gaming options. They are smooth.\nOnly con is upscaling of sd channels. It doesn't do any justice. Does decent job for hd channels. Picture quality is good and wide viewing angles. One other con is during dark scenes(streaming in Netflix) you see pixels appear as glitters. Not always though. overall good tv for the price, most of the time you will enjoy with it.",
            "Excellent Tv at this price range\n\nAll features like 4k, dolby vision and atmos, bluetooth, wifi, gamepad, apps all works flawlessly.\n\nI bought 50 inch tv which is VA panel.Im very satisfied that there is no edge bleeding on panel also I observed tv from all angles this VA panel gives same colour so no issues observed.\n\nBuild quality is solid better than mi tvs. Only thing is tv bracket is somewhat okay. Manufacturer must have studied it but I felt it could be bit more sturdy and strong\n\nInstallation was smooth. Need to drill two holes in wall and then single frame bracket and adjustable straps\n\nFront firing speakers are good but I recommend to have dolby atmos soundbar to truly unlock tvs potential.\n\nTv remote is bit big with unnecessary keys. Plus point is few dedicated buttons like netflix, youtube, zee5 etc.\n\nHardware wise it exceeds others as it has quad core processor with 32 gb storage which helps to install more apps with less lag on ui\n\nPicture engine:\nPicture processing and upscaling is very good. Less lag and fluid motion. Transitions in scenes are good as you see continuous motion without any lags.\nDolby vision works well with hdr\n\nOverall I feel its best value for money deal with all features. I got it for 30499 for tv and 4199rs for 3yr extended warranty.\n\nHopefully it will last long!!",
            "Review based on Product only... As if I try to include review based on delivery and installation then the rating would be 1 star only that too for product.\n\nPicture quality is awesome. I mean at this price point didn't expected this good picture quality. A true 4K panel used. Even though it has VA panel which is different than LG IPS panels from 43 and 55 inch ZXpro TV, it has a very wide viewing angle... From a very sharp angle you can experience a little whiteness in picture but from a very shar angle. I'm very impressed with the picture quality. Just the vivid, standard picture modes sucks... Very artificial. Best picture mode is Movie mode. Perfect for everything you watch.\n\nSound quality is not that great. It's loud. It has bass. But something is lacking but it's kinda adjustable. You can bare with it.\n\nSoftware has a little laggyness here and there in just 3 days. I have to say not the good optimization used here. Can't comment more yet. Got 1 software update. No difference found.\n\nConnectivity is good. Can watch IPL at highest resolution of Disney+hotstar on wifi. Just the gamepad controller is not connecting everytime ... It's like not satisfying one.\n\nLooks good. Feels good. Remote is also good. It's truly BLE remote. You don't have to point it towards TV to turn it on/off or change anything.\n\nChromecast is not good man. Doesn't works always. Sometimes works... Sometimes don't.\n\nApart from this i haven't checked much... Just 3 days of usage and I'm pretty impressed by picture and color reproduction. Just the software slowness is what giving me double thoughts...\n\nWill surely update the review after a month of usage.",
            "Sound quality very good just like a theater, it is 4K Tele so you need high good quality signal for this television, make sure to have a proper settop box, definitely value for money, I like my purchase no worries, also wireless game pad, easy remote, if you feel like treating yourself then go for it, you will enjoy watching movies on this television. Thank you Flipkart you always make it very easy for us, very happy with your service aswell.",
            "Awesome picture and sound clarity, Dolby Sound is very good and awesome. However, Dts content is in Dts format only. It won't support by this tv. So you have to convert it into Dolby audio through audio and video converter software in PC. Once you convert the dts content from dts audio to Dolby Audio then you can seamlessly enjoy the dts content in realistic true 5.1 surround sound on your soundbar,home theater or AV Receiver through Dolby Audio. Then not only dts, It also won't support aac 5.1 and Dolby true hd. If other 5.1 or 7.1 audios can't be supported by this TV don't worry you can convert it into Dolby audio format (ac3) in PC using audio video converter software.. And enjoy by listening true 5.1 suurond sound experience...\n\nThank You!",

            "Great product for the price you pay. Premium look and feel. Installation was done in 24hrs post delivery. Sound is average though it's got a dedicated sound bar. If you are using soundbar then it's good. Also hdmi arc will not work with airtel due to airtel firmware issue. Need to work with airtel technical team in an escalation mode. One cons is it doesn't have a headphone port",
            "good picture & sound quality i like it and i got it for 36000RS on sale. i like the picture quality its superb",
            "Picture quality is awesome and specially sound is just mind blowing. The best TV in this budget. If your budget is in this range then just go for it blindly. You can't find better than this, and you won't regret. In short superb..",
            "Received 50 inch TV on next day. Installation done on next day.\nAlready visit different showroom and seen all TV product in same price range. This TV sound and picture quality is good if compare to other brand like Nokia 2020, TCL, Kodak, Samsung, Hisense TV (Except Tornado), Iffalcon, Sanyo, Sansui, Onida.\n\nVA panel in 50 inch TV and 43 and 55 inch TV - LG IPS panel type.\n\nSound - 5 / 5\nPicture - 4.5 / 5\nConnectivity - 4 / 5\nLook - 4 / 5\nBuild Quality - 4 / 5",

            "100% perfect sound picture and build quality with awesome remote faster smoothly performance \ud83d\udc95",
            "Ive been using the TV for a few weeks now. The soundbar is a good addon but not the best ofcourse. Could be a little bit more clearer. The bass is definitely better than other TVs in the same range but not the best, again clarity is a bit weak. Im probably spoiled by the definition and clarity and bass of my Harmon Kardon speakers. Screen clarity is good, im satisfied and the 55inch size is awesome. I honestly wasnt expecting it to be this big. 55inch didnt seem soo big when i was window shopping in our local mall. 4K video are pretty ridiculous watching in 55inch. I also use this TV for gaming from my PC. I have an Nvidia 1660 and its struggling with resolving at 4k, i have to reduce graphics settings in the games, and running it at lower res kinda makes games choppy, defintely have to consider upgrading my graphic card in the future.\n\nNways good TV, worth the prize in this range and also i feel better not choosing a chinese TV.",
            "Best tv guys ...consider this tv if under 31 k ...very good sound quality ...even at 20 volume its like a home theater ...4k video quality ...games are like super dooper ...and the gamepad also very nice ..playing asphalt 8 is like playing in real life ..thats the quality ...the perfect size it 43 inch dont go beyond it",
            "Picture quality 4/5 (downside is that in bright rooms the screen reflects slightly, most suitable for dark rooms)\n\nBrightness 4/5 (350 nits but still beats most of the budget category TVs)\n\nSound 3.5/5 (increase the volume and even neighbours will hear, lower the volume and even I can't hear, you will need to find the right balance, external bar works fine no issues there)\n\nConnectivity 4/5 (Wireless headphones sounds bit low, don't know if that's an software issue)\n\nDolby vision 3.5/5 (speakers sounds bit low when playing dolby vision movies. Don't know why?!)\n\nGaming 4/5 (Remember TVs are for watching shows, casual games are fun but high end games will lag a bit)\n\nSmartness 3.5/5\n\nRemote 3.5/5 (would have been better if it had a clean look, most of the buttons are non-usable)\n\nMost important aspect to look for a TV is it's picture quality, brightness, panel, color correction basically it's display features and this is one of the best you will get keeping in mind the price. Nokia is also a good choice, but it was missing some features I needed.\n\nDon't fall for a TV by it's smart features, UI, OS, remote all that can be fixed by adding external devices like android tv box, sound bar, etc\n\nGot the TV delivered in two days of placing the order, installation guy came the next day,\n\nI must mention the installation guy from Jeeves was a bit unprofessional and was rushing things, also the wall mount was installed slightly crossed",
            "One of the best purchasr I have made, this tv is as much as you want.\nGood things-\n1. Good picture quality, 4k videos seems like real. HD channels seem good.\n2. Built quality is good, fine finiahing qnd all.\n3. Connectivity is smooth.\n4. Playing games with controller is up level fun.\n5. We keep sound at just 20 and that too is more than enough\n\nThings I didn't like.\n1. Sound quality is good, it gives you theater like experience. But the vocal volume is low, so you have to turn the volume more up to hear the dialogs but other sound effect also increases.\n\nGo for this tv if you want, ita worth it.",
            "I am writing this review after 25 days of my purchase. Initially I hesitated but took risk because of better RAM n memory space this smart TV has in comparison to others in same price range. It turn out an Excellent buy for me. Sound, picture, connectivity all excellent in comparison with price. Good gaming experience is extra..... Thanks to Flipkart n of course Moto.....",
            "I believe this is the best budget 4K TV available in this price range.\nBuild quality is good, comes with stands and wall mounting accessories, Wireless GamePad, Full featured remote, an input cable and finally with a sound bar of 50W. Believe me, that specification for a sound is way ahead for a TV and sounds like a mini Home Theatre.\nDolby Atmos and dts Studio do their work perfectly and Dolby Vision enhances the picture quality and colour vibrancy just like any person would want.\nPerformance is smooth, Booting is fast.\nThis is my one week review. May add anything in future (if required). If you are looking in reviews to know about this product, I should say you can go for this product.\nThanks \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udfff",
            "Overall review is somewhat good , but I still didn't understand the model name ..it should show ZX PRO Or Motorola , it is showing that Flipkart TV , Im missing this logic...I just saw the model name ..I didn't observe this as of now .. Any experts can explain why it is showing like that ?\nOtherwise I will return this TV...",
            "Looks- Average. The grey soundbar at bottom doesn't look great. Bezels are less.\nScreen- Good. Brightness better than TCL and Thomson. Colours are brighter too. However screen bleeding issue is prominent.\nSound- Good. Very good for watching TV. However separate soundbar is required for rich movie experience.\nConnectivity is fine. Remote works well. Dual band wifi is good (required if net speed is more than 30 Mbps).\nGamepad works fine. Can be used as remote also.\n\nOverall good purchase. Will recommend it.",
            "Nice Budget Smart TV... Go For It.\nI Do Lot Of Research Before Buying it & Now I Am Satisfied \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a",
            "The TV is awesome. The colour are vibrant especially in 4k. The TV as 55 inch looks huge with characters as in theatre. The in built speaker not so loud but is having good quality sound. It's good for small room like bedroom. No need of sound bar etc",
            "Brought 43 inch version and felt great value for money product. Highly recommend if you are looking for 43 inch smart TV with premium TV features at budget price. Display is really good for room with high natural light coming in. 2 GB RAM provides smooth experience without any lags. I am playing asphalt 8 as well and didn't observed any lagging or display issues.",
            "Just wow wow and gamepad also very cool not support for pubg. Everything is cool and fine. Audio features should tune by company. I have gone through more reviews before buying all are saying audio will be bit low but with YouTube and Netflix I didnt face the issue, and when turned on Dolby audio it's working better compared to normal mode, No much difference but it's a very good. When Dolby audio movies you watch.",
            "Pros.\n1.soundbar not needed, good soundbar inbuild\n2. Dolby atmos is amazing even in buetooth mode(im using sony woofer speaker set with ampli) best cenematic sound experience.\n3.Picture quality better than good but not upto mark for brand like moto.but for price is good.\n4.hd and and 4k video best to view, sd chanels dont expect magic but upscaling seems acceptably good\n5. Graphic memory and storage big yes better than any brand in market. Gaming is amazing and hamepad is very good quality.\n6 duel band wifi and blue tooth connectivity are good\nCons.\n1. Pic quality is substandard, contrast ratio is poor, blacks are gray.\n2. Backlight bleeding is prominently seen\n3. Response time is good but fast moving scene is bit hassle for action movie lovers.\n4. LG ips panel but dosent feel like one.\n5. Dark room it shows balck as gray and light yellowish screen.\nOverall\nPicture 3.5/5\nSound 4.5/5\nConnectivity 5/5\nGaming 5/5\nValue for money5/5\nSome sugestions.\n1. Keep video on user mode by changing backlight brightness and saturation settings preset settings do not seem well\n2. Use dule band wifi and soudbar or woofers for better experience\nA good buy deal for mutupurpose and economicaly worth deal hust have to adjust with picture quality a little bit but according to price seems woth",
            "Detailed review after 3 weeks of usages\nSound: very gd sound, except high bass which is given by sound bar or woofer. We should not expect home theater sound from a tv. No tv can give that quality. But i still like it's sound. To watch tv serials, news sound is great. I switch to sound bar only when need high bass.\n\nPicture Quality :\nPeople has been commenting and talking, its old display\nAnd Won't match hisense or vu picture quality. But believe me. Its better than that. Full viewing angle. Nature picture whixh is great than unrealistic pictures. Picture qualitiy review you can see at lg Ultra HD (UHD) tv. As there are less review and pictures on moto tv.\n\nPrice :\nCheaper than other tv available with same or lesser specs.\nMore than worth the money.\nUpdate: Sound: i have stopped using external sound bar just to save some power. Now i like sound from tv better than soundbar. More clear n crisp. More than enough bass.\nGo for it.",
            "Pros\n1) value for money\n2) 4K apps and HDR content in bright light is very good\n3) better than tcl and mi tv for the picture quality\n\nCons\n1) picture is so bright.\n2) upscaling issue if you use SD channel and HDMi cable\n3) no proper bass support for sound\n4) no headphone support",
            "A very good product and economical however sound is average, but it would be noticed only if you are used to enjoy music on Yamaha or Bose like speakers",
            "Pros: Picture quality is excellent. So is the audio. Automatic brightness feature let's the user have optimal viewing experience without manual input. Connectivity options are very good interms of bluetooth, wireless etc.\n\nThe gamepad comes with the package is awesome. Its built quality is also good and navigation is very easy. Smart applications makes the experience larger.\n\nCons: All the connectivity options are on the back side. If it is mounted on the wall, then it becomes very hard to reach out for USB, HDMI etc.\n\nBacklight bleeding is a piece of concern, which is going to impact the pixel resolution in the long run. It is strongly advised to reduce the backlight manually in order to have a longer life of the TV.\n\nConclusion: Smart TV with so many features and with latest technology is coming with such an affordable price range. Motorala made it possible. VALUE FOR MONEY, indeed. Thanks.",
            "First thing I love to watch webseries/ movies on big screen. Have been already using Sony led worth 1.6 lacs, took a chance to purchase this model for my bedroom. Surprisingly it surpassed my expectations. It is one of the best model in current market at this price range. Only the tv remote sometimes runs erratic. One small suggestion to u guys, buy this tv for amazing picture clarity that too at amazing price range and buy some good sound bar (preferably Sony) with Hdmi, Dolby atmos support, I bet u\u2019ll have one of the best tv experience\nThanks Flipkart for bringing this wonderful model",
            "Looks great and works great so far. I was skeptical about buying a Motorola brand (for TV) but the reviews helped and also went in for a 3 Yr full protection plan to insure against any issues with service later.\n\nThe bezels are thin and the picture quality is quite good.\nI was upgrading from MI 4A 32 inch to this one and the size would always be overwhelming at once to compare. There is a lot of talk about IPS vs VA panel and the bleeding but I'd save it for the pundits out there, I found it great and see no problems so far.\nThe speaker sounds normal, can't alternate that to a 2.1 or 5.1 quality audio.\n\nThe game controller is fun, I have growing kids so they are very happy with this addl toy and more importantly saves me from the addl game station for now. haha\n\nI din't have Netflix and Zee5 subscribed yet so instead of wasting those two hot keys on the remote, I configured it as Prime Video and Disney Hotstar keys instead, was fun and felt achieving to configure :)",
            "It your budget is less than 40000 and you are looking for a 50inch TV, I'll suggest you to go for this one. The VA panel on this tv is just awesome, it Produces a good amount of black. Colours are vibrant enough. The sound is punchy. Overall it's a good product, I'm satisfied with this.",
            "The Best you can buy at best price . Picture clarity , sound everything is just perfect .",
            "Great tv in this price... Best picture quality and sound also best in this range. I m fully satisfied buy this...Thankyou moto.....",
            "Best at this price with lg panel. For best experience use a broadband connection through lan. Sound and picture quality heavily deteroriates on mobile data. Also factory default settings for sound and picture does not bring out the best in the panel. It needs manual calibration for each type of video.",
            "Founded best Led tv within my budget with good picture quality and loud and clear sound system. Now I have lot of space with 32gb storage and 2gb RAM.",
            "I bought the 50inch. It's a VA panel for this size only. Go for the 43 or the 55. They are way better as I have the revou 55. This ones pretty average for someone who like crisp details. But if it's your first big tv then you'll be happy. I wish the it had better looks like the Revou and an IPS panel.",
            "Good TV in budget.\nStraight win over VU and MI for :-\n*50W Dolby Loud Speakers\n* Game pad\n* Dual band Wifi\n* 2 GB RAM and 32 GB internal storage.\n\nCons:-\nDon't expect Bravia quality image.\nBut better in this segment.\nA better UI is needed for this TV.",
            "Nice tv...\nDelivery and installation was top notch...\nLet's see long term how it performs ...\nHappy to have...\nAll video formats are playing nice...i tried 720p...1080p... 4k too... No problem at all... crisp clear picture...\nSound is ok not too much to expect...\nRemote is like old plus new smart tv remote...\nIt's really good for parents who will be confused to use new age smart tv remote.. which has hardly any keys...\nConnectivity is nice\nI'll say connect ur tv with LAN cable it will give u most stable connectivity and u won't feel lag... And speed will be way better while watching online stuff...\nPendrive can be connected directly without any file manager... Didn't find any difficulty so far...",
            "I think it's better product ever moto tv launched\nThe picture quality is very good enough\nMany people's says about screen bleeding darker lights in videos but I'm not getting any of that in my tv\nThe sound is pretty decent for 10x10 room",
            "Amazing pictures quantity & viewing angles at this price range and sound quality is decent... Delivery, installation and demo were good. Dual wifi is a boon for 3k streaming... I'm very happy and satisfied with this product... Complete package!!!",
            "Ok so after using it for 10 days here is my observations-\n1. Picture quality is good.\n2. Sound is good and sufficient for watching movies but if you want to like extra bass effect then you have to use home theatre. Overall it is better than other TV speaker.\n3. Remote response is fast.\n4. Connectivity is good\n5. Game console is very good and it's battery life is also very good. It works smoothly without lagging.\n6. All remote functions working perfectly\n7. For real picture quality you have to connect it to WiFi. You can't judge pictures quality for DTH channels as mostly channel are HD and for real picture quality you need fast WiFi connection.\n8. I used Chromecast and it worked perfectly without lagging. Even I also checked with mobile hotspot.\n9. Processor is fast and I played Asphalt without lagging.\n10. Good space for downloading apps\n11. Voice command works smoothly\n12.stand bracket is heavy made of metal\n13. Sound bar looks premium",
            "Nice set of features but poor quality panel.\nThe main expectation from a TV is a high quality picture and audio, but this TV has inferior panel and doesn't provide rich colours, it looks dull in comparison to my 4 year old Sony TV panel, which is just a HD tv whereas this is 4k TV.\nBut since i bought this TV for my bedroom to see content occasionally instead of laptop had decided to keep it else would have returned it.\nI think those who haven't experienced high quality panel content will not complain about this TV, and that is the only reason why I reduced 2 stars.\nApart from that this TV is excellent in all other aspects.\n\nHere are some of the main pro and cons\n\nPros:\n1. Remote: It connects via Bluetooth and IR, hence you can use it any direction, but power on/off has to be done using IR only which can be inconvenient, also it has mic for voice search but doesn't have search button, it could have been great addition instead of the Google assistant button.\n2. Powerful CPU, good RAM and large storage memory for installing apps. This is good because my Sony TV takes much longer time to boot Android 9 and also has smaller storage space for apps limiting the number of appa that I can use.\n3. Joystick:I don't think any other TV comes with joystick, and this joystick is of very good quality and I like playing games using it, but since Android TV app Store has limited games, we can't try all the great Android games on TV.\n4. Comes with a good wall mount, I think other low cost TVs generally comes without wall mount stand.\n\nCons:\n1. Panel: This is truly the only thing I hated about this TV, it lacks the colour punch that I receive on my old Sony TV.",
            "It's really a best tv in these price range, I am totally satisfied with the product purchased.\nThe picture quality is really good, the only thing which i did'nt like is when switching to AV mode the sound quality\ndrops down and is not balanced in AV mode, And in normal picture/youtube/video streaming mode its proper.\nThat's the only drawback i have noticed so far in my tv.",
            "1. Perfect picture clarity ( tested high resolution 4k movie also)\n2. Dolby Atmos affect is good ( any smart tv must need external speakers sound system to have more effect )\n3. Gamming experience is good - played asphalt, and other games - should have provided more action games\n4. Connectivity is too good ( able to screen cast without any delay, screen cast depends on phone to phone build quality )\n5. Able to connect remote, wireless ear phones, gaming pad with out issue\n6. 5g, 2.4g connection is good\n7. Till now did got any issue ( 2Gb +32 Gb assured configuration )\n8. Tested USB ports - working fine without delay\n9. Tested all ott platforms and quality is very good\n10. Power on time is extremely fast compare to bootup time from complete power off and overall fast in comparison with other brands",
            "5 months review\nSound is good and more than sufficient for a hall of 12*15ft\nIps display good with 180 deg viewing angle. Sound. And picture clarity good.\nThere is a lag in Android at times during application start. Application features different from the one installed on mobiles. Over all its value for money with lg ips panel Android smart tv.",
            "The motion blur is not managed that well by the TV I'm a football fan and I've witnessed a lot of motion blur it doesn't look like the MIME technology does anything to help it. That's the only thing I didn't like about this TV. Other than that it works like a charm, great 4k, Dolby Vision is awesome too.",
            "Exceptional!! At this price there is no match for this product. Completely a class apart from the likes of MI, Realme and TCL. Can be compared with the big guns like Samsung and Sony. Obviously it falls short but certainly puts up a good fight.\nLet me highlight the pros and cons.\n\nPros\n1. Excellent picture quality (definitely the best at this price point.)\n2. Crazzy Sound. A loud shout out for sound. A 50w soundbar does better than the Nokia's 100w.\n3. Easy UI and fluid android experience.\n4. Amazing gaming experience with the controller.\n5. Android 10 and timely updates.\n6. Upscaling is good.\n7. Bezel less.\n\nCons\n1. Strictly to be nitpicking; the picture quality is not as vivid as Sony or Samsung but they charge a whopping amount for their products.\n2. Nothing more.",
            "This review is for 55\" model\n\nBrilliant picture quality thanks to IPS panel (8/10).\nSound is above average (7/10).\nConnectivity and features are great (9.5/10).\n\nThis TV is amazing value for money. If you are on a budget and cannot go for the Bravia 7500h or something similar which costs at least 20-25k more, I'd highly recommend this one.\n\n8.5/10",

            "VERY GOOD\nUsed this for only 5 days..will update in-depth review later\nMy initial review is that..\nDisplay is very good and viewing angles are super\nSound is only 24 watt..but that is more than enough for my home..I hardly use volume over 40, it's so loud.\nConnectivity is very good\nBootup time is also very fast for Android TV\nRemote is nice with lot of functions\nI sideloaded thop TV, Oreo TV and they are working fine\nWhile watching fast action scenes ,there is slight motion blur..but it is expected in this budget segment\non normal usage there is no issue with display, everything is fine\nOverall I'm very satisfied for getting this 43inch 4k TV for 24999(thanks to Republic sale discounts).\nValue for money for Jan 2021 as all other brands have hiked their prices drastically",
            "This TV is Awesome. The picture quality and sound quality so good. I watched 4K videos, it is Best. The Dolby speakers sound experience is great, i feel the 3D sound dynamics. I love it. Worth for money in this range. Important add-on in this TV is the Gamepad, kind of play station experience. Sometimes the remote voice control fails pairing, but it is easy pair again.",
            "Absolutely good purchase. Please note that I am not a professional reviewer and explaining my and my families limited experience. Generally no one is explicitely reviewing 50 inch model as it has VA panel compared with LG IPS panel compared with 43 or 55 inches.\n\nPro -\n\n1. VA panel of 50 inch is impressive. No issues in side views\n2. Due to Android 10, you can download and use many apps flawlessly. Smooth and bug free OS\n3. Overall build quality is very good. Prefer wall mounting as stands are not very reliable.\n4. Can use external web cam for google duo and installed many games/apps which does not slow down the TV\n\nCons -\n1. Despite of 50W speakers and being really loud, still cannot hear movie dialoges however music is very clear. This is a common issue in all TVs used before. I dont know the sulution to it and need to use frequently for adjusting volume if watching something at night.\n2. Not as cona but for a decent size of hall, i guess 50 inch is more than enough so no need to go for 55 inc\n\n\nOverall its a good choice for regular family usage in budget TV segment. Prefer buying flipkart's complete protection plan as i had a good experience of it for my old VU TV.",
            "Just awesome TV. I suggest to buy this TV to everyone in budget segment. All features are good. Love this product. And special thanks to flipkart because I have ordered this TV on 20Jan morning and TV received on 21Jan at 1.00PM and installation done by expert at same date around 4.00PM. Wow performance.",
            "Good smart TV for the price. Good connectivity. Fast operations. Decent speakers. Display should've been more brighter. Further, blacks appear greyish. This becomes more apparent in dark scenes. No major screen bleeding issue. HD channels appear fine. Even non-HD channels appear alright from about 10 - 12 feet distance. This is good considering that it is a 55\" panel.",

            "Bought@28k, picture quality, sound, connectivity and overall its good to purchase.\nThis comes with a gamepad and which we can use of playstore games. Please don't expect pro games, intermediate games are available.\nThis TV works with 5GHZ wifi, bluetooth gamepad.\nAirtel xstream, hotstar, prime video, netflix, zee5, sonyliv and much more apps are available but livetv option won't be there in any of the apps.\nService should be contacted through flipkart and it should be named as flipkart tv not Motorola",
            "Delivery of the product was as promised. The installation was delayed by one day. But that is ok, can leave with that\n\nAs for the TV (43 inch variant) , then it is working perfect for last two weeks. Have been using the same without any issues for last two weeks.\nAll HDMI / USB ports work fine, basically have all the 3 HDMI and 2 USB ports connected and are working without any issues.\nThe picture quality is best considering the price range of this TV. The 4K video play just fine. The HDR video sometimes look a little on the darker side but manually setting the contrast / brightness etc. works just fine for that. Overall the display is very good considering the price paid for the TV, could not ask for more.\n\nThe sound is normal. For normal viewing it works just fine with enough loudness and clarity. But for a person who likes some deep bass and theater like experience then external sound bar is must. Anyway I have my sound bar from before and have connected the same to the TV using BlueRigger toslink Cable, since my sound bar is old and does not have HDMI port. The cable just fits strong in the optical port, no issue with loose connection etc.. Sound quality on the optical port is great, have connected to my Yamaha amplifier with Bose speakers and the sound is very clear, no noise or other issues.\n\nIf this TV does not give any issues in the long run then I think this will be a very good buy",

Also requested to provide long cable for Audio video cable.",

If you see this TV from straight it looks good. Need to alter the picture settings to get good picture quality!\n\nMEMC support is not available that's the only negative. Also could see some small amount of Screen Bleed which is common in all LED panels so it can be negligible!\n\nIf you don't want MEMC support, Then this is the best TV in this Segment!",

They only support customers of mobile phone devices..\n\nDon't go for this guys..",
            "Using is since Feb 21. Picture quality is good for near straight viewing. Side viewing not so good. Maybe its due to ADS panel. Sound quality is good for 20 watt and small rooms with less parallel noise. Recomended to use with sound bars as it will elevate the viewing experience. Had a real bad experience due to watching 8k (my bad). Sincerely avoid anything above 4k as picture engine is not tuned for it. Did not play any game, so cant talk about refresh rate. Further update will follow.",
            "I have received the product from Flipkart on 31 Dec 2020 and got installed on the same day by Jeeves technician.The technician had initially drilled the holes in the wrong way which caused the TV Wall mount support to sit right on the power socket and due to this he made another hole which shows that technician is not too aware of the installation process.\nAs u are reading these review u already know that specs are top notch for the price range compared to competitors in the market.\nI am writing these review after 4 months of usage.\nThe display is good to watch hd and full hd content and viewing angle is almost 178\u00b0.\nThe sound output is superb but the bass is bit low.\nUnless u compare it side by side with the brand's like sony,samsung ,lg u will not see difference in the display quality.\nComing to connectivity there are no issues as of know for wifi and Bluetooth.\nThe only con I observe is the tv is taking time to open apps some time and some times it even restart(happened 2 times for me) automatically(happens rarerly).\n\nAs a whole I say it is the best affordable 55 inch 4k tv in the market with top motch specs.",
            "In comparable to realme,mi and vu.i think Motorola is the best option to buy because of the quality, brightness,gampad and importantatly the rom has 32 gb inbuilt memory storage.

            "Picture quality is of very good quality but if u conpare it with premium brands like LG, SONY, Samsung etc their will be little less clarity however considering the price point it comes its highly justified.\n\nOne of very good product in this price range which comes with IPS panel.\nDo consider buying it for budget around 38k.",

            "Product is good and excellent\nDisplay : it's very good and crisp and video quality in 4k is amazing I also have vu TV when comparing it's it's clarity is awesome in terms of everything.memc is missing but this won't be liked by everyone and in terms of black screen its bit low compared to one plus tv\nSound : good speakers that comes along, as it's mentioned as sound bar don't expect a thumping bass but it's good as speakers with good surround sound\nOverall good quality product.",
            "The best vlue for money 4K LED TV with IPS display by LG! Huge 32 GB internal memory so you need not worry about running out of space. The CPU and GPU are lacking a bit, but I would advise you not to play danding games on it as the experience is not that good. Instead you can connect a console and play upto 4K with 60 Hz (not 120 Hz but that's fine, if you ask me). Also thanks to it's in built Bluetooth, you can connect any wireless earphone or headphone or even speaker and hear audio which is an excellent option when watching at night! Also with the Bluetooth connected earphones you can hear all game consoles as well though there is a small lag, but it beats having to purchase expensive proprietary official headsets of the console makers.\n\nI would've loved the option to connect and disconnect Bluetooth accessories, but unfortunately the only option given is unpair.\n\nThat said, I did not like the remote. I liked the FireTV remote more as it was very easy to navigate on that remote, but this one is just OK.\n\nAnother problem I faced with the remote was that sometimes Google Assistant does not work and there are only 2 ways to get it working again: restart the TV or unpair and pair the Bluetooth remote.\n\nThe WiFi is also extremely good with support for both 2.4 Ghz and 5 Ghz, but as my router is away from TV I have to use 2.4 Ghz and the speed I get is above 24 Mbps on my 70 Mbps plan with the router in first bedroom.\n\nThe TV has received 3 updates so far and the UI has changed a bit with top tab navigation, but unfortunately no Android 11 yet.\n\nI am satisfied with Android 10 and I don't feel that I am missing out on anything by not having Android 11 yet.\n\nThe TV takes a bit of time to start but it's not much, maybe 2 minutes or so after switching it on from wall.\n\nI have connected it to a Philips 2.1 soundbar via HDMI1 which has ARC (not eARC) and the soundbar displays PCM unfortunately and not Dolby, although the built in speakers support Dolby Atmos but even my non Dolby Atmos Philips soundbar performs better.\n\nAll in all it's a great value for money option and I recommend it over other TVs becuase of it's LG IPS display.",
            "Best TV in the segment, totally worth buying.... better than MI and other similar brands\n\nPros:\n- Ram 2 GB\n- Internal Storage 32 GB\n- LG IPS Panel\n- Excellent Viewing angle\n- Super Smooth UI\n- Fast Boot Option\n- Superb Picture Quality\n- Gaming Controller\n- No Screen bleeding issues at all\n\nCons:\n- Sound could have been better, low bass....if you are using it in a bigger room then you might need an external sound bar",

            "It's been more then a month and I want to give you all my genuine review.\nTo begin with I am really satisfied with moto zx pro 50 inch 4k UHD.\nFirst screen is big having VA panel with side angle viewing is amazing and the pictures in dark ambience is more vibrant.\nIn day light also it's good but better in dark.So always install where sunlight is less.\nThe best mode is movie mode for display.\nSecondly, sound. Amazing it's really loud 50Watt speaker, just sound value 20-25 is more then enough in a big room.\nBut yes in terms of clarity it can be improved.\nThird, connectivity is better just gets connected to headphones,speakers or game pad in seconds and chromecast is okay, with some apps it works fine but with some it lags.\nFourth, gamepad is absolutely amazing and stylish.though we don't have many games but is going to come.\nRemote is also sleek and have dedicated keys.\nIt switch on and gets off quickly.Respinse is very quick.\nAs it is android if you switch off the TV it will take 5-10 seconds in order to load apps and your screen and its very usual.\nI didn't find any issue with white line or white color leakage as it was rumored. Black color is pure.\n\nBut this tv is absolutely perfect with this price range and with such specifications.\nI am very happy with my decision.\nIf someone is confused, I would recommend them to go for it.",

            "TLDR; basic users can't find a better tv than this on the market, go ahead buy it you won't regret it, pro users: stay away, abysmal colour calibration for HDR/Dolby Vision\n\nThere are two use cases for a smart tv: one is a basic user who's upgraded to a smart tv from a dumb tv and just wants to stream something from Netflix/Amazon prime. Many of these users will be using a smart tv for the first time in their life so they will hardly be bothered with pro aspects of a tv screen. For most of these users who constitute 99% of the user base out there in India, this is the best tv on the market you can buy. Hook in, plug in, start streaming and that's the end of it. You cannot buy a better tv than this as an entry level smart tv and at this price. It's simply unbeatable.\n\nFor pro users who actually care about things like HDR/Dolby Vision, stay as far away as you can from this tv. The colour calibration for HDR/Dolby Vision is abysmal, i wouldn't use this tv for viewing HDR/Dolby Vision content even if forced at a gunpoint. My PS5 has abysmal picture quality on HDR on this screen. But then again, the price point for this tv is so low, this is to be expected.",

It has all the amazing quirks and features of android, plus the gamepad, and the tv can handle games very well without lag. The picture quality is FANTABULOUS, and the sound is fantastic.\n\nThere is only one CON, that is when streaming 4k videos on YouTube (haven't tried Netflix), it does not handle them. Meaning, the sound will keep playing, but the video itself will get stuck on one frame. I don't know if this is a problem with the software or the hardware, but it is there.\n\n\nDefinitely recommended.",
            "This is my honest experience after using Moto 50inch TV for one month now. Picture quality and experience was good as I bought a Moto sound system along with the same. Trouble started 1 week back when the power button on the remote started giving the problem at times there is no response from the power button. I raised the complaint with Flipkart Motorola tech support and someone called me to check if the issue is with the remote, but layer realized the issue is with the TV as the remote was working fine. Later a technician visit was arranged and after checking for sometime, they arrived at a conclusion that the issue is with censor inside the TV. Just think my situation within one month of purchase there is an issue with censor and that censor has to come from company, for which they themselves are not sure about the ETA. I bought this TV with a great expectation being a Motorola brand and expected some more quality in the product. One thing is sure the QC is total failure. Finally I expect a little bit more responsibility from the brand about the customer satisfaction and ideally they should have replaced the defective product with a new one. Also, there is no status update from the service partner Jeevees..\n\nThey are tied up with flipkart and cheating customers with substandard and cheap product. Ultimately anything can be sold with a cheap tag price in India.. I think Motorola is loosing their respect a brand which is known for their quality and trust..",

I mean no need to keep pointing remote towards tv, specially when you are handling kids. But need to be careful that any button u press by mistake will get activated. Overall very good experience.

You will see colour calibration is better in SONY But now I don't want to burn my money again on SONY brand.\n\nThe only downside I noticed in this TV are you can't control TV Volume if you are using TV Digital Audio output. U can control if you connect through bluetooth or if you are using TV Speakers. And more over in Android 10 OS itself there is no disconnect and connect options for bluetooth devices. You only have to unpair and pair again. If you disconnected bluetooth device.\n\nThese things may not be a problem for genric people.\n\n\nFinal word: Blindly you can go for this TV.",

Display quality was top notch, can be viewed from sideways too (not extremely side). IPS Panel makes the colors even more rich and premium (although there's some backlight bleeding at the top as it was bezel less panel, can be seen in dark scenes. But still it doesn't spoil the mood or disturbs. Also backlight bleeding is very common in IPS Panel and certain level is acceptable by any brands). 4K HDR10 60FPS, Dolby Vision everything works perfectly. Dolby Atmos is there but I belive it's not like what it's meant for, it's more like a fine tuned equalizer.\n\nOnly thing where i got irritated was with connecting this tv with my hdmi arc supported samsung home theater. Initially i couldn't connect arc. Tech people who came for service had no idea what hdmi arc was, suggested me to connect with bluetooth. Since ARC was not working, I raised return request and it was approved too. But luckily i made some tweaks in settings, now hdmi arc works. Hence canceled my return request.",

I didn't want to go for the brands that are readily available in the market. I kept looking for something out of the ordinary.\n\nWhen I chanced upon this, I was immediately drawn to it as my fascination with Motorola goes back almost two decades earlier when I purchased one foldable phone which is no longer in the market. I have no regrets buying this as I have come to realize that 55 inch television from other brands are much costlier, while the sound they offered is 30 w, a difference of 20 w compared to this product.\n\nI am very much satisfied with the product in different areas - sound, picture quality, design and viewing comfort. I love it and I'm proud of my choice.",

            "Based on a 10 day experience , the product gets 5 stars. Leaving aside the specs ( which are exactly as claimed, by the way ) the viewing of different TV channels as also webcasts, is a pleasure for the eyes - vibrant colours, sharp images, no noticeable bleeding , etc. As for the sound, it's bar misses no beat or volume. Add to that some gaming thrill . Plus almost all Web Apps easy to download from Google via latest Android 10 .

So thanks , Flipkart team , but hope the product lasts and runs satisfactorily for a reasonable period.\nA word about Flipkart product delivery and installation - fast , prompt and hasslefree.",
