            "Took this TV on the launch offer and got delivered on time.\nThe packing was good and the delivery boy helped in unpacking and mounting on the table. Later the installation guy came in and fixed it on the wall.\n\nHere is my view after using it for 15days\n1. Great picture quality. I tested playing some Dolby vision videos out there on the YouTube and the visuals are stunningly beautiful.\n2. The 60w sound output keeps this TV unique from the rest. However to get the real feel of the Dolby atmos, it is best to have it connected to a sound bar, which is what I did. Again the Dolby test videos gave me goosebumps.\n3. With 3 HDMI ports, 2 USB ports, optical port, Ethernet port, AV...this TV has everything. Its not that other TVs do not have these.. But given the price range.. This is definitely .. Great deal. I'm able to connect all my accessories.",
            "Pros:\nScreen: Excellent large screen with minimum bezel, good color reproduction, good visibility\nRemote: fully loaded with hot key for Google voice assistant\nProcessor: good processing speed with no lag observed so far.\n\nCons\nSound: High rated speakers but performance not at par with the rating. It is loud but struggles to produce Clear audible sound, needs better tuning. (Deducted one star for this reason)\n\nLightning fast delivery by Flipkart, professional installation team.\n\nOverall, value for money product.\nLong term durability and performance remains to be seen.",
            "Hi,\nReviewing after 1 week of usage, Excellent smart Tv with Smart features.\nTV:\n1.Great picture quality\n2.Sound quality is also good.\n3.Android 10 give you a great experience.\n4.Google Assistance and integrated easily with Mobile android remote, So you can access tv from mobile.\n5.Broadband dual-channel support , suggested is 5G channel for 4k tv's.\n\nOn-time delivery and installation, thanks to Flipkart.\nOverall Satisfactory with TV, worth every penny.",
            "Writing this review after 75 days.\n\nTotally dependent on LUCK for how many days the TV will work.\n\nPros:\nPicture and Audio quality is excellent.\n\nTo get best audio output, set the audio settings to DTS Studio Sound (enable, surround and true volume) and turn on all the 3. You will get very good bass and treble and the sound fills the room as if a home theatre is connected. You can feel the sound and the stereo effect very well.\n\nCons:\nTV boot up time has increased from 25 secs to 1 min & 5 secs.\n\nSpecifications says headphone jack is available. But no jack on TV.\n\nTV after some days does not download apps from Google Play store.

I tested playing some Dolby vision videos out there on the YouTube and the visuals are stunningly beautiful.\n2. The 60w sound output keeps this TV unique from the rest. However to get the real feel of the Dolby atmos, it is best to have it connected to a sound bar, which is what I did. Again the Dolby test videos gave me goosebumps.\n3. With 3 HDMI ports, 2 USB ports, optical port, Ethernet port, AV...this TV has everything. Its not that other TVs do not have these.. But given the price range.. This is definitely .. Great deal. I'm able to connect all my accessories.",

As far as sound is concerned, set your expectations correctly because it is a 60 watt inbuilt TV speaker and it is not a soundbar with high powered woofer. even though the sound it is great from inbuilt TV speaker it would not match a dedicated separate sound bar with a woofer.\n\nReducing the rating to 4 because the TV does not have a HDMI Arc port . it has been mentioned in the specifications that TV has Arc port but none of the 3 HDMI slots return sound to to the soundbar using HDMI cable. since I am not very serious about using HDMI cable and ok with using optical cable instead, I reduced only one star. when I call Blaupunkt customer support and raised a complaint I received a call after 4 days and the technical person has no clue he was suggesting me to to connect to all the HDMI ports and check if it works. but none of the ports is ARC port and we cannot connect the TV tu to a sound bar using HDMI cable.\n\ni have realised that the technical support team is same for kodak thompson tcl and Blaupunkt. as of now the customer support is slow and inefficient they lack minimum technical knowledge of what HDMI Arc port is.",

Even then, when I listen to music, the sound clarity is very good and good enough deep base. If you are looking for thumping base, then external speakers will help. But can do without. Good enough sound. Voice search also works quite well. Installation was done the very day it was delivered. We'll behaved service engineer. Just hope we continue getting this service. Overall rating is 5*.",
