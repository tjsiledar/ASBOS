            "Overall I liked the TV .. connectivity is great .. but there are some issue which I can live. Overall experience of getting the TV and then having the person install it was very good. Picture quality is just great if you are watching a HD video. Wifi, Bluetooth all function seamlessly. At this rate it's a bargain.\n\nSound is one issue ... It does not get loud enough i.e. if I am listening to a video which was recorded with low sound the max volume of the TV is not loud enough. I need to use an external speaker. I have another brand 32 inch TV and the same video when played on it has a slightly higher sound and I don't need to use external speakers\n\nIn-built Chromecasting is not easy. It takes a bit of time to connect and there after the video and audio is choppy ... I have a separate Chromecast device which I use when needed\n\nThe 3.5 mm headphone out port works but the issue is when I connect a speaker I hear the sound only through the speaker I don't get it in the TV and external speakers. But my 32 inch TV gets sound through both ... Bluetooth speakers work flawlessly.\n\nHDMI connectivity to laptop does not work properly for all laptops. It works on my Asus when connected but my Lenovo when connected the taskbar flows out of the screen .. unable to change resolution of laptop. Still trying if I find a way I will put it here\n\nAn annoying factor I noticed in the TV playing from USB. It works well but my personal issue is it does not support subtitles or SRT files even if they are in the same folder as the video. So I am stuck with playing these videos on laptop",
