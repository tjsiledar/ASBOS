            "Ok firstly let me start by saying that I had to wait 12 days from the time of ordering to the time of receiving the product. Installation by Jeeves was scheduled 5 days from me receiving the product, I had to mail and contact them regularly to get installation done the next day, I don't blame them cause I had ordered during the big billion days so it was natural that it was going to delay but I feel that they could have promptly have increased their staff during this period.\n\nNow, coming to the product itself.\nIf you r looking for a perfect budget TV for your living room and a small room, bang on this is the best product you get in the market today. I was confused between iffalcon blaupunkt and MI 4c pro, and let me admit here that I am a Xiaomi fan. But still I made my choice with this TV firstly because it was cheaper than 4c pro and blaupunkt, and secondly it was from the world's one of the top brand TCL. Thus the trust factor was there. I must admit that the product is just fantastic to use. You get just about everything that you need in today's life to be more that satisfied with the product. To make it simple I would list the pros and cons as tht would make it easy for you if you need a quick yes or a no to decide .\n\nPros:\n-price is affordable\n-sound is crisp and clear\n-videos are sharp\n-supports Netflix, all you Netflix lovers you get dedicated Netflix button on remote\n-latest android support\n-picture quality is good (there is a con too so wait for it)\n-has all ports that you need in life\n-light weight and not bulky\n-supports voice commands is a bonus and a major plus\n-batteries inside the box, well this is because mi 4c pro doesn't\n-2 remotes in the box, one smart and one regular .. so now no fighting over remote folks ...\n-bluetooth support\n-wifi and inbuilt cast present too\n\nCons:\n-brightness is low so if your room is having too much sunlight you might not like the quality.\n-sound is good but low as it has 16watt speakers compared to 20watts in other brands\n-just one usb port, I feel they should have given 2 atleast\n-if you do not have hd set top box , you may feel the TV to be ok . I suggest you do connect hd for best experience . However it's a personal choice, without hd too it's not bad.\n-you have to type everything letter by letter to search or input\n-tends to restart sometimes\n-initially wen I turned on the TV it had a weird noise which was irritating, background noise, so if that's with you I suggest you remove the plastic around and also do a system update , it vanished after that . I mention it as a con as some of you might not be technically strong enough to recognise and this noise was seriously irritating and company should have addressed this while packaging . I am mentioning this as many have written about this noise and thus I have solved it, if you are able to do it too it would be great.\n\nFinal verdict. Just go for it if you are not wanting to waste more money for the brands like Samsung LG as the product is just great and way ahead of competition in turns of all the things . Appreciate your time",

If u connect home theater then sound quality is outstanding but u will find a little bit audio delay with it.means if u connect home theatre with bluetooh then u will get a louder sound but in 3.5mm jack u will get little bit lower volume.\n\n3. All the apps are working fine...\n4. Wi-fi is working fine.\n5. HDR 10 supprt is awsome.\n6. jio tv &amzon prime is missing in playstore u can install it with APK format by using pendrive.\n7. Fully android TV. in this budget no one can provide this type of features with any smart Tv.\n\nso i will strongly recommend this product.",
            "awesome service (everything like delivery, installation and service). picture and connectivity is awesome.. software downloading from play store is good. One demerit is that it doesn't have google browser.. otherwise led is best value for money.\nThank u flipkart and thank u iFFALCON.",
            "Good budget certified android TV. Points to consider:\n1. Picture Quality (3 out of 5): There are lot to offer, too much picture setting options provided. Required to explore & set as per your convenience. There are options like HDR, micro dimming, motion clarity but not to get most of them in experience considering size (32\") & budget.\n2. Sound (5 out of 5): Just one word awesome. I can say best part of it much better than expected. Options like 5 band graphic equalizer, bass boost, pcm, volume leveling all are good and works to. & yes Dolby's audio.\n3. System setup (3 out of 5): OK but more easier options required. Even sometimes feels confusing. Only plus point is that whatever setting you did in the end can be applicable for all sources as option provided.\n4. Connection options (3 to 4 out of 5, provided what & how you actually want to connect): If you just to want basic connectivity like using Netflix (1 month trial available or if you are having an active plan), Hot star, SonyLiv, Yupptv, Erosnow, Jiocinema, YouTube, etc then it's superb works good with lan or WiFi network. Note: Amazon prime not work at all & not supported anyhow.\n*Chromecast available but too much lagging.\nSo, its good with android TV apps with basic network connectivity options.\n5. About Android (2 out of 5): Much disappointed considering it's branded as certified Android TV. Android version is basic Oreo with no system updates even Android security path is much older (August 2018) no updates available for this. This is not acceptable at all with being certified Android (apps updates available and working too but as technology changes inevitable much more required).\n6. Performance (4 out of 5): In this budget the performance is good. I am used it with SonyLiv, Hotstar, YouTube's with uptime more than 10 hrs in last 4 days. Installed several apps, uninstalled several apps, also Tvgaurd app provided is good to use to keep good health of TV.\n7. Delivery & Installation (3 out of 5): delivery time is more (12 days) installation is very short timed no proper demo about features, I explored all this options self after installation. It's bad.\n******** Final world: I go for it only for its budget. If budget is good I would explored more options. But in this budget I am happy with this (just enjoying jiosaavn with awesome sound).***********",
            "I'm writing this review after using this TV for a past month.\nLet me divide this review in Pros and Cons\n\nPros\n1. Sound quality is really good. It has dolby atmos speakers. So, it gives a cinematic surround sound experience.\n2. Picture quality is really good if you're streaming HD content from YouTube or Netflix.\n3. Wifi connectivity is fast.\n4. Built in Chromecast.\n5. Price is affordable\n\nCons\n1. Although it's called Android TV but you'll not get full fledged Android experience. Can't install majority of Apps from Playstore.\n2. SD channels are not clear and sharp.\n3. Sometimes the UI of the TV hangs up.\n\nStill, it's a decent buy at such a low price range. I'm not disappointed.",
            "Exallent android tv for the price. It is better than MI TV 4A Pro. Bluetooth remote is awesome and very convenient. Picture quality good and sound is exallent even they are 16W but loud enough. I bought IBELL sound bar for theater like experience. HDMI ARC feature works with IBell Soundbar. I am happy with the Flipkart product and service.",

            "Positive: It's a perfect Budgeted Smart Android TV that you can avail of on the above price. All this is as expected liked the Video and sound quality. they installed it on the next day of delivery.\n\nNegative: Nothing sort of Negative it's just Connectivity is the week for Wifi and I received only one Remote instead of two as mentioned in theirs specification.\n\nI have done various research before buying this and all I would say is that It's better to purchase this one instead of MI 4A pro.",

            "Too good for this price.. Got it for 8800 including offer. Sound quality is good and loud. I dint even cross above 30%. Picture quality is also good. Netflix is there by default. I am satisfied for this price range. Go for it.",

You will not regret your purchase. #@what else you want. #@Just go for it without second thought. #@This my experience after one week, I took out time to right this review because it might be helpful to someone.",
            "After use of one week, found the TV an worthy buy. But in this review I'll just mention two Cons. Rest all are pros. Let's see what happens in long run. Con 1 : Sound. Sound cracks out after 20 point. Whatever, for my 300 Sq ft room, I have no need to make it more than 20. Con 2 : lower ROM. 8GB is a bit low now a days. Wish the box will not lag due to storage. Now what i loved most is the easy cast from mobile. Attaching a picture of it... (Casting Photograph\ud83d\ude01)",

            "Great viewing angle, the sound is very rich and the bass is great.HDR is realy awesome in this price range. And also the system was lag free working smoother but it can't handel big games like asphalt Call of duty, other wise this is the only tv fully loaded in this price (highly recommend)",

Don\u2019t think you will ever enjoy casting amazon prime on this TV. Keep safe distance at least till amazon prime works on this.",
            "Excellent Budget android tv, If you have a small room then this tv is ideal for you. When I purchased it in Oct 2019 the only drawback was non availability of prime video in play store. But after the latest update prime video is now available in play store.",

            "Its truly worth it as a smart TV at this price with superb sound quality and HD picture is worth the price",
            "Please go for TV and this TV is far far better than MI TV. The most good thing I liked in this was it's sound which is too great. Rest can't say about its Customer service. But TV is value for money and i am writing after using it for 10 months",
            "Value for money. As pricing concern it's great deal. Nice sounds, picture quality. Fast connectivity with WiFi. Best luck iFFALCON.Move ahead",
            "This review I am writing after purchased of 1 month. Flipkart service is excellent delivered before committed date but for installation I have make several follow ups for which I have given one star less Excellent Picture Quality with optimum price, it get hanged up & auto restart in a day, sound quality is good, I have installed all the android apps plays very fine. It has android Version 8 but most of app not available in play store, it can only install TV version apps & so many mobile version app doesn't work, both remote control works fine. I have compared picture quality better than MI at my neighbors. I am recommend this tv to worth buying & value for money",
            "For a TV the main aspect we should consider is display but I am disappointed with this display as its a pretty average display but when compared to MI TV the display looks good. The main problem with this TV is it automatically restarts several times a day it's irritating some times. Connectivity is quite good overall it's a pretty average purchase. If display is ur highest priority then go for VU 32' TV and get a chromecast. If u need better connectivity features then it's a pretty good option. Overall my rating is\n\nPicture -6.5/10\nSond - 7/10\nConnectivity and Android features - 8.5/10\nOverall Rating - 7/10",
            "Its a good buy it does the job for me initially i had lot of confusion to go for either mi tv or iffalcon but i chose iffalcon over mi because of TCL brand. Picture quality is above average I'm using SD settop box for (AV input) but on HDMI its really good adjut the picture settings manually to have great quality. Sound is also good on this one. On smart front i use only Hotstar, YouTube and jio tv all works fine that to from mobile Hotspot only even chromecast works fine.",
            "Awesome smart TV with much cheaper and best price. Go for it.",
            "Blindly I recommended this TV after using 8month...\nEverything Given as promised only one thing will disappoint you that we can not install Amazon Prime Video on this how ever I installed through pendrive and that's pretty good.\n\nBest thing is the compact size of remote\ud83d\udc4cI liked the most.\n\nQuality of display won't disappoint you that's my guarrenty in this price range.",
            "Read the full review to Save your money.\nplease note the Television is perfectly fine as 10 days of Use. Also if you have old 32 inch TV I would suggest go a size bigger as these TV appear small when placed at same spot.\n- The clarity and volume is pretty good.\n- only in black/dark videos you will see pixels\n- I have connected all my Bluetooth devices and work really fine.\n- Smart remote is of good quality.\nSCAM:\nthere seems to be a scam running when you are putting an Old TV for exchange, the delivery person usually rejects your tv stating some issue in static mode and I was made to pay the difference amount due to the offer price I bought it. I got the TV checked from technician and he said TV is Fine but it's a scam that pick up guys run to avoid picking old TV and make us pay the difference. He also offer to Tak the TV at lesser Value which I declined. Hence if your TV is being rejected raise a complaint with Flipkart and ask for later delivery date.",
            "This is good budget TV.\nI found viewing angles a bit issue...\nVolume could have been a bit better.\nThe discounts provided by flipkart was amazing.\nOverall it is a good value for money deal.\nI got it @7240..\nInstalltion and demo was also olay.\nThis was done on time.\nUpdate: I found that TV hangs if used for long hours.\nLike after 4 to 5 hours it shuts down... Need to boot up again and it works fine.. I hope the company is listening and push some software update to fix this issue.\nUpdate.: Disable screensaver from settings and it is fine.\nSideload OREO TV app to watch free HD channels using wifi.

Same set top box is working fine with other TV's however i changed with a new set top box and TV is working flawlessly since then. Must buy extended warranty along with order. Good screen.

            "At the price point this is the best value for money. This has certified android TV version and enough 1.5 gb ram along with 8gb internal memory ( 4.7 gb user available). I got the 2019 version and that comes with one remote only that is the voice search smart Bluetooth remote. Display quality is ok with good saturation and natural looking colors. Build looks sturdy and bezels are quite narrow. All in all TV looks much more premium. Speakers are ok and sufficiently loud for medium sized room. UI is stock android and apps can be easily side-loaded. This comes with 2 HDMI ports but one USB which was a letdown. But I found a workaround for it. This TV supports USB 2.0 hub and I bought one from local market. Now it can support multi USB devices and I verified 3 devices working together - Pen drive 16 GB, USB mouse and USB keyboard. Even the multimedia buttons on keyboard work. Wifi works perfect without any issues and you can connect Bluetooth headphones too.\n\nClarity on SD DTH is good enough. Couldn't test HD DTH as need to upgrade my connection. However, other apps like Youtube work awesome in Full HD. Netflix works perfect and easy to use via direct button on remote.\n\nNow moving over to some cons. Display is not so bright and direct sunlight can cause issues as brightness levels are not on par, just 280 nits. Some TVs in this range come with 400+ nits brightness. Sound is alright but not so loud and could have been tad better but can live with it. Also there are no physical buttons on TV so if remote malfunctions then you can't even turn it on.\n\nNow some myth-busting.\n1) I read many reviews stating restarting problem - I never faced it. TV remains all and never crashes.\n2) Sound breaking at high volume - Nope volume can go high upto 100 and still doesnt break/sound awful\n3) Remote batteries running out in days - nope batteries run fine. I am using it for over a month and still working good with original batteries that it came with\n4) Also TV goes to last source directly like HDMI/AVI. If set top box is connected then it powers on to it",
            "The product is good that too at a reasonable cost.The features which i liked most are Hotstar & YouTube chromcasting. You will get blue lines vertically if the interconnection speed is low otherwise the picture quality is also good.\nGo for Iffalcon instead of Mi.",

            "Picture Quality: it shows images widely, i.e. the images looks fat. Also, colours change when viewing from wide angle. images are not so sharp and bright like HD. Android: Great features, it is completely loaded, so many apps, works like a smartphone, very fast to switch between apps. Build quality: great finish, everythins seems perfect and good quality. Add ons: Comes with a free wall mount which is very sleek. overall: I would say that at the end of the day what matters most is picture quality and it lacks in that segment, which is not upto mark.",
            "I like the Iffalcon tv... Advantage is that it is google certified so i can control my tv from mobile also... Overall Tv works good but sometimes feel lagging and smart home takes time to load. Hope if they give update to the tv then please improve ram management and loading time of smart home screen.",
            "it is worth a buy. by my first look I can say the TV has good features, good sound and connects very fast to your mobile or router. the TV remote is very stylish and easy to use. you can download all app on play store. I would like to iterate it's a pure Android TV and the best thing I liked about this TV is that I can cast my Netflix from phone on to TV.",

Installation of new apps are Lille difficult.\nWell tech people can do it.Over all it is a best TV for the amount what we paid.",
            "I have tried all the things with the TV.. so my review like that:\nsince it's android certified so I thought all the apps that are available in playstore in phones could be downloaded here in TV also.. but that's not true.. which was a great disappointment for me.. also I could not find voot app on TVs playstore.",
            "Android certified TV is just a hype, you won't get many apps, even a web browser is not available. Don't know what's the issue with Android TV. You might be able to install APKs but there is no surety that the app will work. Like in my case Amazonprime doesn't work so not all apps will work.\nNext coming to smart TV experience it is not too fast not too slow but decent.\nSound quality is decent and loud enough.\nI had to replace my TV as one remote was not working next one works fine. But, I had a problem with TV as it used to restart after 3-4 hours suddenly. Which got resolved after two updates.\nComing to screen quality it is good but not best, I see some of the time specially while watching HD ones by apps colour leaks and the dark colour is not that good. And this is coming from a normal user. View angle is good.\nStart time is decent. But there is no air remote and two different remote control is really too much and not required at all.\nGood about this was at this price android certified is not there, also sound is good, no extra app needed for mobile casting. At this price point value for money but I expected a little more specifically no colour leaks and had more options to install apps as Google store is not of much use.",
            "picture quality not much good but sound and connectivity is best from others. If you can compromise with crisp picture quality that's not for you other then it is value for money and recommended. I don't know will iffalcon give us regular update. Service of Flipkart is really awesome delivery and installation too fast but jives technician did not give any demo they didn't know much about smart TV other than installation. I faced rebooting problem in after 3 day but it is resolved after factory reset. Thanks Flipkart again.",
            "Viewing angle is pathetic. Viewing direct only giving clarity with color. Side view gives you less color blur pictures. Aspect ratio changing to 4:3 from 16:9 even after resetting multiple times. Audio quality is average. I don't know which brand was watched before by the 5star feedbackers. My Tv was Micromax normal HD ready Tv. Clarity and viewing angle was way better than this iffalcon. But I paid 8574/- that is the only relief after my HDFC card discount",

            "Product Delivered as per schedule and I faced huge problem in the installation from JEEVES Team. Its time for flipkart to change them completely.\n\nI have been using this product for nearly 2-3 weeks now and here is my review.\n\nSpeed and Display : (Average )\nI was earlier using MI Box for my old 24inch inch TV for more than an year and i could see there is a huge difference in the response time and app loading comparing both. MI BOX was extremely fast in response time. From switch on to playing a video in youtube this TV takes more than 30 secs which i feel a bit slow .\nAlso i could find picture quality to be little avg compared to MI Box .\n\nPlayback : ( Good )\nIt detected my HDD and i was able to play the contents at ease. only drawback is the interface could have been better for HDD playback.Surprisingly it detected my old deleted pics in the HDD which i am not able to view in laptop until now.\n\nSound (Average ) is average but since i have connected my Creative 2.1 speakers to this , i felt no issues at all.\n\nFinally , I would suggest to go for MI TV 32 inch which is 1k higher than this since we could have a better android experience compared to this.\n\nMy verdict - 3 / 5",

Sound is surprisingly clear and loud + has a music only mode to save electricity. I now have hotstar, zee5, prime, netflix erosnow and sonlyliv which replaced my airtel DTH and ~400 bucks of commitment every month. I only imagined it to have 5Ghz support though. Yet, I got way more than what I paid for.",

            "First of all.. the difference between this Tv and most others in this price segment are.. This Tv runs Android OS for TV and most others run some form of linux or other OS. What this means if you have play store here and can install apk files as well. So, now that's out of the way let do the ProS and Cons.\nPros :\n1. Functionality is Great, comes with two remotes. One for normal usage and other for Smart Uses which supports Google Voice\n2. Most Apps are can be installed from play store or can be side loaded.\n3. Chromecast is inbuilt and works flawlessly with Mobile, PC or Mac,\n4. Two Hdmi ports, I connected with PC and Fire Tv Stick, Works perfectly,\n5. Audio is very loud for its size, no need for external speakers in most cases.\n6. Form factor is great, very slim and slim bezzles.\n7. Although it's low resolution panel but supports smart features like HDR and Looks Great for such a low price point.\n8. Unlike Mi TV, wall mount is free.\n9. Audio output via 3.5 mm jack is superb.\nCons.\n1. Although sound is loud but its not great. Sounds shrill some times.\n2. Does not support prime Videos, Even side loading won't work in some cases. Play store apps are also limited if u are digging deep.\n3. Does not support all mouse and keyboard, also Only one USB port makes it hard. At least two would have been great.\n4. Does not support large storage devices. My 1tb external HDD wont work\n5. Android OS for tv is almost Stock, Would have preferred a little bit of polished version like Mi's PatchWall ANdroid.\n\nOver all its great for this price segment, better than MI 32 on flipkart. but Mi 4C pro is better but priced much higher.",

The delivery team was also courteous and they opened the box to check the condition of the product. Installation and demo was to be done by Jeeves consumer services on Saturday, 20th Oct. But surprisingly I got a call on the delivery day, 17th Oct and the technician was polite and fixed the wall mount in no time. I had seen many negative reviews about Jeeves, but even after being in a small town of Udupi, the service from Jeeves was pleasing, all thanks to Aman Electronics, Udupi. Coming to the performance of the television, the picture and sound quality is very good, thanks to micro dimming and Dolby sound feature. It is far better than my old Sony Bravia. Overall very much satisfied with the television. Cheers.",

            "Hello guys,\nThis product is awesome. 100% Value for money. Before placing order of this TV, I read some reviews in which, some users are facing some problems i.e.\n1. Unusual sound from speakers while watching videos on YouTube,\n2. While on AV mode connected to STB, the TV continuously flickering.\nThese are some common issues I read while reviewing reviews of customers. I also faced these issues but, these issues are very easy to solve even that \"second\" issue is the issue of STBs, and not of the TV. Now,\nSolution for 1st issue: Check for system updates as well as App updates from play store. Go to \"Settings (from home screen)>About>System Update\" for system update and sign-in with your Google Account to enable play store services.\nSolution for 2nd issue: If your tv keeps flickering while on STB(Set-Top Box), then change the stb settings. Search for AV settings in your STB(may vary for different STBs) where you've to change the \"PAL\" to \"NTSC\". That's it.\nIn the end, I conclude that this TV is amazing, best speakers, very responsive, no hanging issues at all. Maybe for some users, the brightness of the TV might be an issue if they place TV in a room where amount of sunlight is very good, but it is not bad at all. Regarding the price point, it's the best Android TV under 15k. Go for it!",

The item arrived on time and installation was supposed to be three days later, however the service guys came in, at the same time which is highly appreciated.\nPros: pictures quality amazing for the price range this is the best tv so far.\nPrice: Budget friendly android smart tv with latest updates.\nSound : feels like theatre since it\u2019s Dolby 5.1 no need for an external speakers. If one wants to keep it that way, then absolutely not a problem.\nApp compatibility: need to check this feature yet since not much explored\n32 inch big enough for medium size living room which is quite good.\nCons : it\u2019s only HD however I don\u2019t expect 4K for the price range.\nSo far one happy customer thanks Flipkart\nWill update the review once again after using for a month or so",
