            "Giving this review after two days of use. Very happy with the product, flipkart quick delivery and the installation. As per the promotional offer from hisense my 55\" tv will be under warranty of coming 5yrs. Hope there won't be any issues before and after. Initially I thought of using my Sony home theater for better audio, now I realized it don't need because of Dolby Atmos. Thank you Hisense and Flipkart.",
            "First of all thank you Flipkart,Second one is Hisense.\nNow review for my 43\u2019 led Tv. Some people say this product review wrong .But My opinion this one is awesome.Very fast connect .Picture quality is very nice 4K mode and HD both mode . Product is impressed for me and my family. Sound is very nice . All function are work very nicely and also useful .All over experience is unbelievable. Once again Thankyou Flipkart and installation team.",
            "I bought this TV with some expectation as I understood that this is an international brand. But not as expected.\n\nWhat i like:\n1) Light weight. Easy to cary. (But we don\u2019t carry or change location all the time)\n2) Easy to setup, hope most of the TVs now a days are simple to setup.\n3) latest android and most of the apps are installable. How ever i saw still some app are not available but sufficient apps are available.\n4) Happy with the 4K quality at this price range. Sony and Samsung have excellent picture quality but we need to spend 1/3 more money than this one.\n\nWhat i don\u2019t like:\n1) Picture clarity for HD content where colours are not bright enough (even after changing multiple setting from options). So for regular videos like 720p quality or HD quality its not so good.\n2) Black levels are badly controlled. When you see a night scene, darkness is really bad. Blackness will have lot of red dots which will definitely not give a good fell of watching it.\n3) Navigation buttons on remote are very close especially down navigation & home button and up navigation and google voice assistance. When we try to use up and down buttons one will press home and google assistance buttons. So always we have to look at remote before operating.\n4) Sound is average. I felt sound quality is same as a 6years old hd tv what i have. But little clear at high volumes. I have to check with an external out put.",

            "Bought this TV in the inaugural sale with 5 year panel warranty, I am happy with my purchase and here are my thoughts after 4 days of usage\n\nPros:\n1)The picture quality is really amazing, Clarity is also good.\n2) HD channels look really great, SD channels look decent.(Yes only decent not great)\n3)This TV shines while using the OTT platforms, you can truly experience the quality of the 4k panel while playing content on OTT platforms\n4)Sound is also great, I don't think you require a Sound Bar even if you place the TV in the living room\n5)Connectivity is seamless(Bluetooth, Wifi, HotSpot and Casting) have not noticed any issues till now\n\nNow Cons:\n1)Color Management:\nI did not like the color management on this TV, especially Human Skin tones look a little Reddish.\nI have seen the Iffalcon TV, I like the color management on IFFalcon TVs and this might be my personal preference.\nYou will notice the color management issues while watching TV channels from your Set Top Box.\nIn terms of contrast some channels look really dull and some channels look blown out like really high contrast.\nIs this a broadcast issue or issue with the TV itself I don't know.\n2) Quality of the Remote:\nThe quality of the remote is really bad, you can hold the remote in hand and tell it is made of cheap materials. The buttons too are not very good\n3) Noticed lag in UI on the first day itself especially while using the Google assistant. I do not use Google Assistant regularly but I tried it just to\ntest and noticed significant lag.\n4) Looks: You get what you paid for, this TV doesn't look premium at all. Anybody can look at the TV and say it's a budget TV",
            "Product satisfies all the mandatory requirements one who looks to have an android TV.. Only one improvement could be in wall mounting bracket. May be one who is living in compact homes will find it bit risky of getting TV hit accidentally. Distance between TV panel and wall behind it is huge due to bracket depth is more comparatively. It should be short i guess. Leaving that its worth buying in this price range.",
