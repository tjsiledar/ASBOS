The service was Good and Satisfactory.\nThe Tv Clearity has awesome.\nThe Sound was also Great.\nFeatures are easy and Good.\nI have sughest all to purchase Value for money.",
            "It's just been a day since I've started using this TV but the experience is great, specially the picture quality. Great android experience on a 40 inch TV. The sound is also good. Good connectivity. I was able to play videos on HD clarity just by using my mobile hotspot.",
            "A good budget friendly andriod option. Ideally for bedrooms. Flipkart delivery was as per schedule and installation was neat. 5 yrs panel warranty is a bonus",
            "Everything works fine and happy wid d pdt but the voice recognition on remote does not work.. Not sure what shall I do... Raised a complain, still waiting for a resolution..",
            "The tv is ok for the price.Many mobile apps are not compatible on this tv but all apps are working in my Iffalcon tv. I urge Hisense should fix this issues via software update. The sound is moderate but not too loud, display is good for the price,but nothing special or eye-catching. Also remote is quite old fashioned, and menu button is not working via playing apps or YouTube so you can't change picture or sound settings via playing, Everytime you have to come to home screen to change it.Also wireless USB mouse not working smoothly.Cast screen from mobile is failing Everytime, even Google Home is not pairing sometimes.Miracast also not pairing.The best thing of the Tv is the 5 years panel warranty which has been the driven force for the consumers to buy it.Hope Hisense would release the update for better and loud sound and picture quality and fix the bugs for TV's smooth performance.",
            "Delivery and installation fast and prompt. Its value for money product from the global brand Hisense. Picture quality, sound and connectivity excellent.\nUPDATE .....\nAfter 7 days of use I have noted the below points.\nPros.\n1. Ultra HD videos worked amazingly in this 1080 p resolution tv.\n2. 24 watts sound is wow and no need of a sound bar if you have a normal living room.\n3. Apps selection and installation is very quick and we dont feel a lag.\n4. It's a made in India product with 4 star energy rating.\n5. Stunning performance of inbuilt chromecast.\nCons.\n1. Disney Hotstar app is not coming with this tv and also not available for install.\n2. Volume is very low for Prime videos.\n3. While swapping from apps to cable tv , we have to wait for some time for the sound to come out.\n4. As expected google assistant is not that much responsive.\n5. Mobile mirroring will work with pathetic clarity.\n6. Apps are not updating automatically even if I turned on the auto update option.",

            "Best tv value for money product.sound quality and pictures quality very well. connectivity fast.Google assistant well work and fast response.5year warranty for pannel.I am satisfied",
            "Review after 2 months..\n\nI bought this on January 21 2021 and delivered by 24 jan for the price of 15999 ( extra money for extended warranty for 1499 for 3 years .) So basically this product price will be 19999 all the time but at the time when i was purchasing this was having the price of 18999 due to republic day sale and i used my HDFC card for 1500 extra offer and other 1500 offer i redeemed by 200 supercoins.\n\nAs i was already having an samsung 49 inch curve tv .I was looking for an budget tv to connect to my playstation 4(There was a lag i can notice while the game was loading but once the game loaded it was good to play no lag or frame drops) and i came across all the tvs like VIU , TCL , Thompson and many more.I spent across 15 days to search the best that suits me and finally purchased this as it was having great offer.\n\nI was not super satisfied or super happy with the product as it was having few issues.ill say by comparing the price i bought it for it was an OK product for me.\n\nPositives:\n1. Picture quality was ok\n2. Connectivity\n3: light-weight easy to carry\n\nNegatives:\n1.Sound was the biggest drawback like whenever the movie was playing the background score was dominating the conversations .No clearness in the dialogue.\n2.The product was having a lot of issues in the sound department which need to be taken care All of a sudden the sound or voice will be muted and after 3 seconds it gets played automatically And sounds will decrease\n3.The body was full kind of plastic.\n4.Display captures the finger print marks.\n5.At few instances whenever I was watching youtube or movies suddenly it gets redirected to homepage without our involvement such a irritating scenario.\n6.Not suitable for the people who are having an large hall .as the sound will.not satisfy at all\n\nJeeves service guys:\n\n1.At intial stages i faced a lot of connecting issues like YouTube, Netflix i was unable to open i am able to open only the general tv like local cable and dish.(sorted by the jeeves service guys). thanks to them but..\n2. I've explained all those negative things i faced to the service guys and i guess like it was an defective piece and requested for the replacement the service guys won't believe the thngs u faced they are like we should also face the same situation which u faced then only we can start the process of replacement.\n3 All those problems will pop out suddenly in the usage and u just come to check for 10 min and at that time if those issues like sound issues wont come then it was not the case like product super good and working perfectly u should have the trust in the customers as i am requesting for the replacement not the refund..\n\nBottomline, if u want an tv like optinal or secondary and it should below 16k after all offers then go for this but if u want take an tv for long-run invest some more money and go for other brands.\nMurthy",
            "1.Excellent TV in Budget i got almost in 12300 with flipkart axis credit card.\n2.Picture Quality best with colour balnce.\n3 Best connectivity If you have Broadband/wifi at home.\n4.No Sound problem If you use in Bed room or medium size hall. Need to Use Extra Sound Bar If u loud lover.\n5.

Very supportive staff gave full demo also. No need to purchase Extra Movable wall mount stand from installation engineer .Already best given by company.\n9. To Enable Voice search assistant pair your remote with TV bluetooth. To learn watch youtube video.\n10.

The only issue is limited storage free space available if we try to copy large movie files in to it which can easily be managed by a pendrive.",
            "Good product among crowded category of under Rs. 13,000 for 32\" Android TV, it surpassed the competition by giving an additional warranty of 5 years for panel.\nCan't compare it with my another smart TV, a 40\" Smart Sony for a huge price difference.\nIt does the job.

            "I bought 40 inch tv , I'm writing my honest opinions after using 1 week\n1.Bluetooth remote disconnecting automatically.\n2. Sound is ok . Not good for few channels/movies. Better to use sound bar for better movie experience\n3. Picture quality is very good - natural colors. Don't use light opposite of tv - reflection will happen for few viewing positions.\n4. Video support- few web series/serial are not playable. Unable to find out proper reason till now.\n5. Apps are working properly. Google Assistance is working properly.\nIf you are searching for bigger tv in lower budget with all basic features of smart tv, definitely go for this 40 inch model. Value for money",
            "This is a great value for money product but there's more to which you might want to consider.\n\nWhen it comes to tv, the display and the sound is the major parameters to weight. It's a great display, colors are vivid and it's pleasant to view nothing that's above the bar though.\n\nThe sound is where I'm not really satisfied. The speakers aren't that good, it slightly creates echo and at high volume its difficult to understand the dialogues. My living room is a bit small, so I'm not really sure if that's the reason but it's definitely worth mentioning here. I didn't see anyone else complain about that but still I'd recommend you to dig deeper on the overall review of its sound quality before you make the purchase decision.\n\nP.s: Don't hesitate to get the flipkart extended warranty. It's worth every penny.",

Pocket friendly compared to other expensive brands. 2. Android TV so no worries about apps you can choose to install unlike Fire Stick with apps limitation. 3. Build quality is not bad and not that great but sleek and elegant in a manner.\nNegative about this TV. 1. Picture quality is sharp but some what not natural colour, seems to have a hue colour tone which cannot be adjusted even after fine tuning with settings but okay not to really worry about it. It's tolerable. 2. Sound is bad , pretty low need an external speakers for good sound. 3. Android runs bit slower on this TV. 4. Input source is stuck on to Android TV by default and no way to change that. You need to change it again and again for other input sources. Final Verdict. Can't compare it with other expensive brand for picture quality but it's worth the price you pay. Lastly there is a saying ' Whatever you own is the best'",
