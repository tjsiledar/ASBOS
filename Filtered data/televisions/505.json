            "I have been using a 32 inch Sony Bravia before replacing it with iFFALCON. Have been using the TV for some weeks now and overall it has been a satisfying experience. Rather than going deep into the known specs of the TV, providing a review here based on my experience as a normal user.\n\nDesign\n\nVery lightweight and easy to handle. From front side it looks premium. The thin bezel sides give the TV a 'less frame - more screen' kind of look. The back side is also less bulky compared to its competitors. The USB and HDMI ports are well positioned at the left back side and are easy to connect. But the Audio-Video ports are at the back side and wires might stay pressed to the wall. The wall mount provided seems to lack in quality a bit, but it might just be enough, thanks to the lightweight TV. The remote is slim, long and solid with well placed buttons.\n\nDisplay and Sound\n\nThe display is absolutely stunning with crisp and clear viewing angles. The customization options in settings are seriously nice, both for display as well as sound. The sound quality is very good as well as loud.\n\nSmartness\n\nIt satisfies all your basic needs expected from a Smart TV. Connects quickly to WiFi network available. It has some in built browsers and apps like YouTube, Netflix, T-Browser etc. along with an App Store where you can search for apps like Hungama, ErosNow etc and other apps based on categories. YouTube is really good and you can see videos in the original HD clarity. Have not tried NetFlix yet. The TV interface even provides recommendation and categorization of videos like sports, education, music, news etc. Games are also available.\n\nThe responsiveness is fast enough, maximum 2-3 seconds in worst case scenarios. The only problem with remote is while typing and searching: no in-built alphabets buttons in the remote, so lot of click with navigation buttons needed to reach the alphabetical characters in on-screen keyboard.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn short, you get a Smart TV with good looks, crystal clear display, loud speakers with digital sound, all at this price! At the price range, I doubt if there is a better option available. I strongly recommend this one if your budget is between INR 12K-14K.\n\nGo for it!",
            "Don't buy any product from flifkart .

            "This is my 1st Day experience review... Best TV for budget oriented ppl after lots of investigation on to buy smart vs non smart, finally found quality product which looks good and simple... which either way looks premium too, picture quality is good and sound quality is awesome...This TV doesn't come with much of preloaded apps and for 32 inch we can't use Tcast efficiently...either way we have all time entertainer YouTube...if you want to experience smart TV as beginners, this product is value for money...as for the product service and maintenance it's trustworthy because of new products from trusted brand TCL... kindly come up with new update and features for 32 inch TV iffalcon...",

But as I mentioned earlier it is a good TV in its own place.\nInstallation process is at its own place.\nOverall a good deal.\nRemember its just a TV and it has all the features which should be present in a TV. Anyone who wants to upgrade or buy new TV must go for this.\nMy friend is using TV from TCL from past 2 years without any complaints & iFFALCON is the latest series by TCL. So I went with it without any doubts.\nIt got what TV's of reputed brands have. It has nothing less than compared to them.\nThank you Flipkart for such a good TV and exchange offers are really good.

            "If you are planning to survive with a TV without God's intervention then surely it is a good one. But if any fault occurs forget repairs. Only heaven's can cure but not the customer care. Even if you are ready to pay the money.... The customer care won't have parts like a simple remote control. The remote stopped working in exactly 1.5months. 1 month passed - never heard back from the customer care. Complaint made to Flipkart. They were helpful as always. But they do the same what you do.... Call customer care. So finally the technician visited after Flipkart's help but with a day back date saying you just made a complaint \"we are on time.\" So its my fault again not theirs. And the visit was only to tell me that yes your remote can't be repaired you will have to purchase a new one...... But where is the new one????? Only God knows!!!!!!",

That was quite remarkable.\nNow, to talk about TV-\n1) I was not expecting a 10W speaker to be very effective, but what surprised was the clarity and Bass effects it gave. It's loud enough to give quite a good competition to a decent subwoofer. Thanks to DOLBY.\n2) Installation of the TV was so simple that, I was able to do it myself within 10-15Mins. (Could not wait to try it until the Service guy could come :D )\n3) TV demo was done in the evening as it was promised by Flipkart. Thanks to them for making it happen within a day.\n4) For this price, the TV has decent specs. The applications available might let you down though. Since I do not use too many applications what is provided there is more than enough (Mostly use Youtube and Netflix)\n5) TV remote is excellent, well built and has all the options.\n6) Playing movies through USB is damn easy, totally happy with \"Movies\" picture mode and \"Sound\" mode that this TV provides. Made it feel like, watching in a theater when lights off.\n7) Connecting to Wi-Fi was very easy.\n8) T-Cast works well. Also, Screen Mirroring\n\nDid not find any issue with the TV till now. Hope this lasts for long. Loving it. A real winner at this price range.",

I viewed a lot of reviews of newly launched smart TV but there focus was on 55'' segment and all were fully loaded and justifying, but for 32\" were very few on youtube and that was also not with any excitement. ya they all told you can play YouTube and Netflix and I decided to purchase it. what extra I found later the person who installed the TV showed T-cast feature ie: sync your mobile with TV and control the TV as you control your Android phone and each program online display on mobile is very good of T-cast app. later I found air mouse that is very pleasing scroll on mobile screen and pointer will move on TV. the last thing I wanted to add that was surprise for me Google Search, facebook web version, whatsapp web version instagram all was manageable on a big screen that is very good. lastly I will say I am not an expert but at this price it was a surprise box for me",
