            "Everything is true whatever they said but it does not have dual band wifi. It supports 2 tb hard disk very smoothly but it does not support 4tb hard disk. Viewing angles are very bad.... But I am very happy with my purchase and it is realy very fast and responsive.\nRecommendation; just buy mi tv box 4k to enjoy disney hotstar in 4k.... And make it an android tv. Or wait for 5 months to get updates.",
            "I've got the 55 inch variant and these are my thoughts after using for a month\n\n- Great PQ with acceptable levels of blacks but blooming visible at times when watching extreme dark scenes. So micro dimming is definitely just a gimmick.\n- 30W speaker is good enough and is very clear so soundbar isn't a necessity.\n- Upscaling is good and SD content looks very good on this tv.\n- OS gets a lot of flak but they fail to mention the fast bootup times (under 15 seconds) which is a huge pro for me. I was fed up of long booting times on Android TV in the past. I rather get an Android box/stick than having an Android TV. This is just a subjective opinion so not everyone might agree with me on this point.\n\nOverall i'd recommend this TV for anyone looking for a large screen TV with a low budget. If Android on TV is needed then you should definitely avoid as you won't get any updates for Vidaa OS in near future.",
            "Just go for this amazing budget tv, much better than Vu, hisense, nokia, mi and few more.... Race to compete with samsung lg and even sony in terms of picture quality and booting speed, I have lg, vu, Panasonic all 55 Inch at home, I found Toshiba a better than all the tv in price and picture quality, Design",
            "Awesome picture quality..\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\nIf u don't need android apps more,then Don't think too much just go for it.\nValue for the money.\nExcellent picture quality.\nconverting SD content into HD is great \ud83d\udc4d\nVIDAA os is too fast as mentioned.\nColours are awesome \ud83d\udc4c\nCompletely satisfied.",
            "Picture quality is superb in HD and 4K mode but SD quality is average.. Sound quality is good when put it on table top stand only, In the case of wal mount installation it's not cleared because of the down fireing speakers.. Otherwise it's a good product and value for money..",
            "My only suggestion would be to include Hotstar Disney+ app. Other than that, the product was worth every rupee and even more. Amazing picture quality and upscaling and great sound quality. I would recommend to consider this to every TV buyer.",
            "Apart from tv Apps other New Apps installation not possible, vidaa software not like Android.Volume not expected, sound output 30w but not that much hearing, pendrive 3.0 Not compatible.\n\nMentioned Designed in Japan, Not believable. Japan Design is worlds No 1 and Valuable. Never found like this.\n\nMy previous tv is 6years old still compatible pendrive USB 3.0\n\nExpect more Quality improvement",
            "Its an excellent TV with superb sound and very good WiFi connectivity . I use 50MBPS from Airtel and have not faced any lag with Netflix, YouTube or swapping between channels. The bezeless frame is very impressive and even the setting functions are impressive UI",
            "Thanks to Flipkart for its best and prompt delivery just within two days after the booking,I got my TV in my home with same day installation. I purchased Toshiba 50U50 when their scheme of 4 years full warranty,And I git the na v very next day without any sratches or damage,Kudos to the delivery boys ,who were very helpful and understanding,they delivered my tv in heavy rains, without any hassles plus safety.The installation was also very quickly done with full safety measures , installation guy was very good in handling all the aspects of the installation.Talking about the Toshiba 50 inch TV, its best at this price plus me getting a 4 year warranty is like the cing on the cake.Picture quality is at its best, plus there are different picture modes so no need to set the picture.all the modes are ek se badhkar ek.coming to the sound ,it's Dolby,and it really shines in this department ,I am getting the best quality with my Motorola amphisound Home theater 5.1 via hdmi arc.whuch easily got connected.now my home has turned into a cinema hall with beautiful picture and amazing sound. Thanks to Toshiba for such a lovely TV.",
            "Flipkart delivery is on time, but installation support is very poor. they will give a date while placing the order, but after delivery there is no proper support on installation of the TV. hence giving low rating.",
            "Picture quality is good, (can't compare with top brands). Better than budget local models.\nSounds average. loudness excellent clarity average.\nConnections are good, laptop and phone connects nicely.\nNO app side loading or downloading, smart usage not satisfactory.\nVery limited apps Netflix and prime. Google assistance not available. Alexa not useful here.\nBT works OK remote OK. Not dual band WIFI, it is false clime.\nFHD upscaling good, SD upscaling average.\nAt this Price 23.5k, value for money. You are not android freak, this is best buy.",
            "Thanks to the Flipkart for speedy delivery and same day installation makes me super exited.\n\n1) It was not like Android tv\u2019s which takes ages to boot.\nThis tv runs with their os(LINUX). Extremely satisfied to setup so quickly and it turn on straight away.\n\n2) Do not judge just because of it\u2019s 1.5 gb ram, LINUX software do not need heaps of ram unlike android tv\u2019s\n1.5gb ram is quite sufficient.\n\n3) Picture Quality is flawless. It does great as just like most expensive brands in the market. It has true colours as mentioned\n\n4) People whoever sitting in bigger hall definitely need speakers though it has 30W output.\n\nToshiba just started by re-entering to INDIAN market where people look after for budget friendly appliances. Guys believe me I waited nearly 4 months since rumours started that Toshiba going to hit Indian market with UHD TV\u2019s. I\u2019m really satisfied and it\u2019s worth every penny.\n\nNote: I run my TV with Apple tv 4K which i must say Wowwwww.\nPeople whoever having their 4K sticks they will truly get satisfied with picture quality.\n\nJust one word go for it",
            "Excellent tv, premium quality picture and sound is also brilliant,connectivity is also fine.. Wifi, screen mirroring, Bluetooth and all is excellent.awesome built quality.If you are fine with its os vidaa,it's a great tv.I am giving a 7 star rating for this tv.",
            "TV is good but vidaa os is not up to the mark. You won't get much app option in this TV, like Disney hotstar. you can't istall other apps from outside so better go for an Android TV. It is like a traditional TV if you want to watch traditional TV then you can buy it. Picture quality is good far better than MI , sound is ok.",
            "Nice tv in this price segment. Non Chinese product. One of the reputed brands. Picture quality is good for hd and above. SD channels are not upto the mark and this will happen with every tv nowadays. Except for higher brands. Else it good TV highly recommend.",
            "Excellent Tv go for it ,4k,Hdr , dolby vision picture quality super,Hd channels Also very very good, Sound also super , connect external soundbar sound quality super with Dolby atmos effect. Over all very good Tv.",
            "Sound is extraordinary in this tv you won't need a home theatre unless you really care about bass. Picture quality is good and is value for money at this price point. Connectivity is not soo good in this tv. It took a couple of minutes to connect to my bluetooth speaker but it's okay type you can let one off the hook. You will really enjoy watching things in it.",
            "Very best in is this price range, brilliant picture quality excellent britness & deep black hd channels looking very good even sd channels also good quality , no black spot on the screen like another TV as hisense or any other, cast from mobile screen is also good only my concern is audio quality is just above average. Just Go for it .... I got this tv just 19990..",

            "Ordered on 18th of sept and got delivered on 20th so got 3 years of extra panel warranty. Tv is beyond my expectations. Reviewing after 9 days of usage\n\nPros\n1. Dislpay: 5/5 excellent dispaly where Blacks are deeper and whites are brighter. Quality of hd channels will make you smile.\n2. Sound: 5/5 sound is pretty loud and clear You will get the sub woofer effect in the theatre mode.\n3. Connectivity: 5/5 there is no problem of connectivity till now wifi connection is very good and can access to each and every port very easily , screen mirroring is cherry \ud83c\udf52 on the cake.\n4. vidaa os: 5/5 the os is so optimised that things run on just a single click.\n5. Delivery and installation: 5/5\n6. Miss alexa: the feature is very useful you can ask for anything and get done by in a couple of seconds.\n7. You can play your fav. Music with its screen off, a very convenient and good feature.\nCons\n1. Sometimes alexa disconnects and need to sign out and sign in again I don't know why is this happening may be a net issue though it can be fixed in a software update.\n2. As of now there is no hotstar but as company said there will an update in first quater of 2021 which includes almost all the other apps.\n\nWorth every penny.",
            "Not able to install Disney plus hotstar their is no Google Play Store if you want to watch disny plus hotstar, Sony live ,Zee,voot ect. You hav to connect with screen cast with your smartphones to smart tv the\u00f1 you can able to watch..",
            "But for backlight bleeding issue, I would have given 5 stars. The picture quality and Software is top notch. Backlight bleeding affects real life performance in some backgrounds. If this issue is addressed and Hot star app is uploaded, Toshiba can really compete with even premium btands.",
            "It has excellent black level and colors pops.\nBefore ads playback in youtube, when screen goes blank, it feels as if the tv is turned off, Black of this tv is that good !\nFactory default colour settings are not good, after fine tuning the colour settings, it shines.\nOne of the best picture quality in budget segment, sole reason to buy this tv, excellent picture quality, same as samsung/LG.\nMy tv viewing time has doubled after buying this tv. It is pleasure to watch streaming content in this TV.\n4K, Full HD, HD contents are treat to watch. SD contents are sufficiently upscaled , and looks descent, Not bad, not good.\nVidaa has very limited functionality and apps, but it is fast. My suggestion, use android box, or fire stick.\nIt is a VA panel, still no major color shift from any corner of my room. My room is moderate 12 by 10 feet sized.\nFlipkart service was excellent, delivered before time, installed on same day of delivery.",
            "ONE STAR RATING FOR JEEVES\nTHEY HAVE DISCONTINUED MY COMPLETE PROTECTION PLAN BUT HAVENT REFUNDED MONEY\n\nNOW IN CASE OF CLAIM,THEY WILL HAVE AN EXCUSE THAT THE PLAN IS DISCONTINUED.\n\n\nPLEASE...I Request you to stay away from this Ponzi schem",

            "TV stop working after 8 month , I am waiting about 2 month for solution but no solution still.",
            "Hi, if you are thinking of buying this tv they you should keep some points in mind. I won't say it's advantage or disadvantage because that's relative to the individual in question.\nAs far as picture quality is concerned it's the best. Yes nokia tv have more brighter panal but the HDR performance on this tv it far superior.\nSound is pretty dope for a \"TV\" don't expect subwoofer quality because it's not a subwoofer.\nInternet connection is great, yes it's only 2.4ghz but it doesn't matter much...\nREAD MORE",

Appreciate Flipkart for promptness of service.The only setback was the installation service provider...the coordinating lady was extremely rude.
