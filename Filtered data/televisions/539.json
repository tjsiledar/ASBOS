            "BEST LED TV AT THIS PRICE BETTER THAN OTHER ALL RIVALS LED TV IN INDIA AT THIS PRICE .SECOND LED TV I HAVE PURCHASED FROM FLIPKART .FAST DELIVERY AND SAME DAY INSTALLATION THANK VU AND FLIPKART",
            "Excellent product at this budget. The picture quality is much better than other brands offering 55\" LED televisions at similar pricing. The brand VU being an American brand adds to consumer's inclination towards the product as most other television in this price range are wither made in China or India and their sustainability is a question mark. I have been using VU since last 3 years. All my bedrooms are equipped with 32 inch VU television and this 55 inch I purchaed for my living room. I think VU could add more accessories such as HDMI cable and multiple USB connectors or at least offer the same upon request by paying requisite amount. But that's not a big thing to bother as the price and quality describes the product in one phrase 'Value for Money'. More precisely, if you were to compare with Samsung and Panasonic LED TVs, VU is just one step on the staircase behind them but not to forget that Samsung and Panasonic LED TV of 55 inches would cost 20,000 more at least.",
            "The TV is an excellent piece of work from the company as I just used it one day only so not goin' to say too much I'll give full feedback later but yes it sucks too much electricity so be ready for the increased electricity expenses, it's an ultra hd TV so it's sucking data like blood.",
            "wonderful sound system. screen clarity also very good just purchased week back.\ninstallation done very quick in just one day. but still now not received extended warranty card from flip kart..",
            "picture quality is not much sharp n smooth I expected some smooth motion but its not there ,playing 30fps videos only when it plays 60fps videos then only you can expect some smooth motion n blur free picture n video quality...I didn't see 60fps videos on YouTube not there's no option to play the video with slow n fast modes you can see that options in laptops n computer. ...will check all types of features new let you know it's my one day usage review only",
            "After using the TV for 10 days, following is my review:\n- Delivery & Installation (5/5): Delivered as promised with open box inspection, and installed on same day. No problems here.\n- Picture Quality (5/5): Excellent picture quality with vivid but natural colors. Very bright picture, the kind seen only in high end TVs. Excellent viewing angles with very little color/contract loss even at 45-deg.\n- Upscaling (4/5): 4K is superlative. Full HD is excellent. HD is very good. SD is acceptable. The TV strives to put up good upscaling to make even 360p YouTube videos watchable.\n- Audio (3.5/5): For all the fancy tech (24W output, Dolby Digital, DTS TruSurround, TruBass, TruDialog, blah blah), the sound is average. There is very little bass even with Bass Boost on and tweaking the Equalizer. That said, the audio is loud and clear even at high volume. However, this is not an issue for me as I hook it to my Home Theater. The output through Optical Digital port is excellent.\n- Smartness (4/5): The interface is a bit slow (what you expect with 1 GB RAM and 4 GB Storage?) but once connected, there is very little lag. Dedicated buttons for Netflix, Prime Video and YouTube are a bonus. Many Apps are missing, but remember, this is not an Android TV. Mobile casting works flawlessly.\n- Connectivity (4.5/5): Except Bluetooth, you have everything you need.\nThings to consider for potential buyers: No doubt, this is an excellent choice at this price with great picture, good sound, very good picture upscaling, excellent connectivity and reasonable smartness. However, to complement the huge screen, you need better sound, so may have to invest in a soundbar. Not being an Android TV, you will miss many Apps and most importantly, voice control. With just 1GB Ram and 4GB Storage, it is not future proof. Also, there is no Bluetooth. But remember, this is also cheaper by atleast 4K as compared to Premium Android version. If you are OK with these small cons, this is the best choice.",

Good Picture quality.\n\n# Good Sound quality.\n\n# Reasonable price. Value for money",

            "worth for money with nice clarity and faster delivery.. delivery scheduled on time..",
            "My biggest concern while buying this tv was color reproduction. I had bought a 39\" VU tv before for my parents but the color reproduction in that wasn't good. However this one has pretty good quality colors. Coming to the sound quality, you won't need an external speaker for a moderately big hall. Connectivity wise it has sufficient (3) hdmi ports. I don't use the inbuilt OS, I pretty much use the fire tv stick. The tv also has the CEC option by which you can control the fire stick with TV remote itself however there is noticeable lag if you compare the response with native remote. Also has the the direct optical port for connecting external speakers. The remote is sturdy. I do miss lack of buttons on the tv, so if you misplace the remote you are out of luck. :) I am completely happy with the purchase. I did read review saying it consumes a lot of power, but it actually doesn't.",

Flipkart has delivered this product on time as promised - June 17, 2019 and has been installed on the same day. I really like the process which is implemented. The delivery boys and installation person have handled the product very carefully. The installation person is experienced one came up with all his requirements to mount the TV on wall. I didnt have to spare anything extra from my pocket.\n\nI only have one suggestion that flipkart or vendor should arrange to take away the television boxes, thermocols from customers, now days its difficult to dispose off such things because of environmental issues.\n\nOverall, satisfactory product and recommended to others.",
            "Brought after watching lot of reviews and videos on YouTube... This is my second vu tv before this I was using vus 49 inch full hd tv... I had no problem with that.. And hence I ordered this tv with 3 yrs warranty.\nHappy with the tv I brought it for 36 k including 2 yr warranty....\nThis tv is best for hd and 4k video formats picture quality is far better..\nIf anyone want to watch sd channels then you should not go for 4 k pannel... ( rather it may be sony, Samsung lg or any other companies tv)\nYes the pannel is good and the sound is also clear audible... u may require soundbar for bigger room for better sound ?\nOs is good I don't see any lags...\nNetflix and YouTube works flawless...\nMiracast also works with my redmi note 5 pro.\n\nOverall Very good option... You can attach Android box if you require the best Android experience.",

            "I am giving this review after 06 months of use of VU 4K (50 Inch) TV. Initially I was little bit worried, if the picture or build quality of VU tv is good or bad... but after using it for 06 months I have found that the pictures are awsome, specially HD and 4k and till now running very smoothly. The sound quality is also above average. Previously I considered that Branded TVs like, Sumsung, LG, Sony are only good, but after using Vu Tv I am convinced that even if the price is much lesser comparing to Samsung or LG etc. branded Tv, VU is exceptionally well in performance despite low in pocket. Hence, who are thinking to buy a new TV, can definitely consider VU Tv....I will give it 4.5 out of 5",
            "The product is definitely awesome in al departments except for it's sound. It is installed in a 160sq ft. room and the sound seems a bit low according to it. Sometimes the sound is very low but when I restart the TV, it goes back to normal. It is very rare but it is there. Other than that, there is no better TV at this price.",
            "HD clear picture. Sound quality is good although I connected it with Sony hometheater.\nIt comes within budget. YouTube Netflix Primevideo are directly connected through remote.\nIt's a good deal compare to other branded similar categories.\nAwesome purchase.",

Only two problems are there one is not android TV but still can use other apps by browser then google and another bad thing is remote is ordinary not smart so it take lots of time for typing write any search item",
            "Review post usage after 2 months:\nMy City of Delivery: Baroda, Gujarat\nReason to buy: Recently bought new house\n\nReview: One of the Best Buy I ever had for my new home\n\nPros:\n1. Whatever you can best imagine in your smart tv\n2. Refer to point 1.\n\nCons:\n1. As it\u2019s not android tv, the apps are limited in VU STORE. But if you are satisfied with Amazon Prime, Netflix and\nIf you are fan of Hotstar or other apps, I would prefer you to additional buy amazon firestick with it.\n\nOnly reason of not buying is if you are a way toooo unlucky to receive a faulty product from the seller.",

            "The 65 inch is worth buying, The screen is awesome. viewed some 4k content online and it blows up your mind. The normal HD channels also looks very good.\nPlease make sure that you wait until the installation team comes before you open the box. The first delivery of TV had some issues with the display and it was replaced without any fuss in a day as the installation person himself found it after opening the box infront of me.\nYoutube, netfix, prime works very well. ensure you have a good internet connection. Wifi works just fine but if the speed is low, the display quality suffers. It happened to me one day but later realized it was due to the internet bandwidth and not because of the tv.",

            "using it for 2-3 weeks now. quality wise you wouldn't notice any difference unless you are also using a premium product too in another room. Visually sound and picture quality is great. 8-bit HDR not 10, but again the price is just right. If you are planning to use in a bright room then you may find brightness on the lower side and don't use right against a light source it would fall in to the screen and destroy viewing experience, this isn't a premium product.\n\nVewd app store for this TV, so limited apps, if you want full Android experience then add in a 4k fire stick. I added a Bluetooth transmitter for another 500 and have gotten myself a very decent package in terms of value for money",

Pretty decent value for money.\n4. Quick delivery and Installation, 2019 manufactured product.\n\nCons\n1. The browser is more or less useless. Is slow and it is a pain to type and search as the remote lacks IR pointer.\n2. The sound from the TV speakers are just about ok. There seems to be a software issue as the sound in not consistent across channels or even on the same channel. It suddenly gets loud during commercials or if there is some dance sequence and once it is over it will get very low. I have read other reviews complaining about this same issue so it\u2019s not just me.\n3. No option to side load any other app or browser.\n4. Could not get it to record live content on to a pen drive.\n5. Netflix and Prime apps keep forgetting the home WiFi network, need to reconnect each time.\n\nVerdict\n\nIf you can ignore the poor sound management and don\u2019t mind spending few extra minutes typing and searching content, this TV is good value for money. The picture quality is good and provides a nice viewing experience. So it does the basic job decently but other than that nothing much.",

As soon as 2 years are over, the TV will break down ( Has happened to 3 more ppl whom I know who had purchased). Then comes the biggest scam of extended warranty through Jeeves (Total waste of money). On a scale of 1-10 in service , I would rate them -10. Have been chasing them for 1.5 months now through mails, customer care yet have got assurances only but no resolution. The local ground team of service & customer care are in different orbits altogether with no communication. It took alomst 20 days to arrange for TV pick up after lot of hassle, post repair also TV was showing same problem. Again pick up done , Has been 18 days since last pick up yet no resolution. As per their policy if repair is not done in 30 days then they process for refund, but now they are even refuting that claim. Even after multiple calls & mails to initiate the refund since we no longer have faith in their service, they are reverting that order is under repair only. It has been such a pathetic/harrowing experience with the Jeeves team that I seriously don't want to purchase anything from them. I just want to get refund so that I am done with this scam.\n\nSo basically I am left with no TV, no refund till now & a long mail thread of customer care assurances that my query will be responded in next 2 business working days :|\n\nFlipkart Team - Hope this review will find the right decision maker who can actually help out.
