            "To be very honest, after booking this product, I had second thoughts... There were many other brands offering products which had better specs.

Sound quality is a vital part of the overall viewing experience. By having ONKYO onboard, Nokia has done justice on that front.

After three hours he was able to install. His perspiration told that he was a victim. One request to Flipkart and all service provider, please do not appoint such stupid engineers. You must appoint experienced one.\n\nUPDATE : After 3 days expert and experienced engineers did a Tech-Visit in my house to solve the issue. They were able to solve most of the things.

If you are expecting 4k in this price range then wait for 4-5 years.\n2. Sound is just awesome.\n3. Build is quite good but wall mount set could have been better.\n4. Works fine on mobile hotspot. I just saw a full ipl match on hotstar. Decent picture quality with respect to mobile data speed.\n5. Screencast works really good\nThis is best TV set in this price range.",

Sound is better than expected with lot of customisation options. Interface is also good.",
            "Reviewing after using the tv for 2 weeks. Picture and sound quality is reasonably good. Connectivity is average. Tv takes time switching from one platform to another, this should be improved. Everything cant be shared from mobile to tv, just few platforms are defined. Delivery was ontime, dont understand the reason for the installation to happen after 2 days. This flipfart should focus upon. Overall good performance till now. Let see how flipkart provides after sales service in case of need. Good day.",

            "Tv is just great , sound quality is best when compared to other tv. Slight color change when viewing from side, (purane phone ki trh bhootiya nahi dikhta hai) , picture quality very good.\nConnectivity options are awesome. Easily connect you phone, external speakers, cast an app, cast screen, everything works good (after software update).\nSound by onkyo gives very good and powerful sound. Dont need external speakers.\nIf you have good internet connection, dont need set-top box, free content already available on hotstar and jio cinema ....\n\nBut, you cannot cast jio-tv app from phone to the TV... That would be just awesome, but unfortunately jio does not allows you to cast screen when running jio-tv. Even if casting starts, jio-tv app will stop loading any content and you will see only black loading screen.",
            "I am basic user so from my side\noverall 4 Star,\n.\n4 Star for the inbuilt Onkyo soundbar\nbut the real thing I experience you can enjoy a movie at very good volume but not the music video as it's seems.\n\nYes for movie viewing its should get 5star\n\nFor Music video only 4 Star as sound is very good at low volume or below average, you can't increase volume as sound will get distorted, but still you will Love it at this price.\n\nSpeed performance is above average as it got 1.5gb Ram which will help u in coming years.\n\nI like the sound n display changing option without going back to Home page. Yes u can change settings while playing videos in YouTube or VLC, for this I will give 5 star.\n\nIt's good viewable for night having advantage of VA Panel.\n\nAt 15999 or 15499 it look costly but if you can buy it below 14k then it's very Reasonable for its offering features.\n\nWill update more after experiencing\n\n\n...\n...\nAfter some days I find it more soundable as compared to one of my Mi 43inch 4K, picture and options are very good as compared to 4k on their price you paid",
            "Awesome TV my 1st TV these was super product Wifi Connectivity Awesome Thank you Nokia",
            "I can\u2019t really complain about this as I got it quite cheap. But if you are purchasing it for MRP it\u2019s not worth it, there are many models out there that have a better video quality than this one. I use this as my bedroom TV so I\u2019m quite pleased.\nConnectivity wise I use the Wi-Fi to connect the TV and i face frequent disconnections which is sometimes annoying. I also noticed that the TV has become a little slow after i updated the system, I guess this is quite common in android TVs.\nThe sound is quite good but I did experience a rattling sound at higher volumes, so I went ahead and purchased a separate sound bar.\nThe video quality is not that great and I can sometimes see pixels when I am watching from up close, my 8 year old Samsung TV is better in this aspect. I\u2019m not very impressed with the display as I know there are better displays out there but since it\u2019s Nokia I am hopeful it will last without much trouble just like their phones did years ago.\n\nI will not recommend the 32 inch version as I\u2019m not very impressed with the quality of the video and you can hear a buzzing sound at higher volumes. This would make a very good companion strictly for your bedroom, when connecting it to your laptop the image quality diminishes further.",

It has only one energy star,means consumes more energy compared to other brand. Sound is as much good as home theater. One can go for it in this price.",
            "keep ...give gud service ..becoz nokia is best brand in aall like mobil nd tv and everything... so give gud service .... . hope u do great job.... i have all product in my home....only nokia....",
            "The TV itself is okay..ish, after you switch on you are greeted by a really cool intro but soon after you realise it just a cover. You need to have a really good WiFi connection in order to cast anything from your phone as it only have Chromecast (no screen mirroring) and that's a really bad thing and it SHOULD BE WRITTEN IN THE FRONT PAGE DESCRIPTION, coming to the screen quality, yes it's a good display, not very bright and not very constrasty as well. The highlight of this TV is it's sound, I doubt that there's Onkyo speakers in them but they are best in budget. You can't get better sound quality in any TV upto 20000 INR.\n\nFor connectivity it's a typical smart TV except screen mirroring, you can only cast your screen using Google home app that means you need to have a really fast and stable connection in order to cast your screen.\n\nBut here's the truth I ordered it with a Sony 32 HD ready smart TV, there's around 8000 buck of difference but man it's a hell of difference when you switch them on side by side. Even though Sony isn't an android TV, but that's the thing it doesn't need to be, it has every feature a budget buyer longs for, so instead of wasting your 13000 buck on this TV just go for any Sony, you'll see the difference.\n\nFlipkart if you're reading this then If I can somehow return it and buy them both Sony, I'll be the happiest.\n\nThankyou",

But don't expect thumping woofer effect. Just good for a bedroom or small room.\n2. Tv navigation is fast compared to my other hisense 32 android tv.\n3. Google assistant mic sensitivity is also good compared to hisense 32 again.\n4. Remote is small, minimalist design easy to use.\n5. All apps work smooth, installed 3rd party apps via apk too, they are working great.\n\n\nCons.\n1. Picture is not so great. Blacks are not good. Here hisense is better.\n2. First android Update was very slow.\n3. Slightly takes more space in back when wall mounted.\n\nI have taken 3 years extended filpkart warranty as my earlier Iffalcon stopped working in 2.5 years and couldn't repair it.",

But it's almost impossible to reach flipkart or Jeeves support to schedule timely installation.)",

There's pinking tones on white and black is not solid. It's crushed. Refer images.\nThe viewing angles are very very bad. From straight forwards. The colours are okay. Black is black. White is a bit pinkish. But at an angle black turns into reddish as you can see in the image. Please don't buy this. Invest and buy samsung or sony or even LG. Leave these cheap TVs. It says nokia but nokia has nothing to do with this TV. It's completely made and services only by flipkart. Flipkart has bought the nokia brand name that's it. I wanted non Chinese so ddint get motorola TV. You can consider motorolla. It's better I think. Not sure. But the service guy who came home said all nokia TV's seem to be having this issue. Moto doesn't.",

Nokia is getting huge some of Million dollar amount from Flipkart to use Nokia as Brand. Originally TV is made by Chinese company in India near Tirupati (Partner of Wal-Mart and Flipkart). Nokia has nothing to do with it. All the parts of TV imported from China.\n\nMy previous Blaupunkt TV was far much better than this Nokia (?) TV. You have to seat exactly in front of TV to enjoy true colours of any channel. Picture quality is just ok. Sound quality and Wi-Fi connectivity is good. But, picture quality is not rich like other brands like my favourite LG TV. You have to subscribe to HD channels and seat in front of TV set to enjoy the viewing.",

It was promptly replaced.\n\nComing to the TV,\nThis TV does not supports 5Ghz 802.11ac and so you can't connect to faster 5GHz wifi networks. Come on Nokia even my 4 year old devices support 5GHz wifi. Even the 4k 55inch version of this TV does not support the faster 5GHz network. Do consider this point before purchasing. If the TV is in a different room than the router you will face buffering issues a lot of times while watching high quality videos.\n\nThe internal 8Gb storage is inadequate. Out of that only 4.4 gb is available for the user.\nI have the following additional apps installed\nJIO cinema, Netflix, prime video, hot star, send files to TV and x-plore\nAnd my TV already has only 540Mb free left. Any additional apps I try to install it complains of low storage.\n\nThe TV software is buggy and at times just reboots out of the blue. Also connectivity to Bluetooth headsets are not reliable. Most of the time it just does not auto connect to a pre connected Bluetooth headset. Then it has to be deleted and paired again for it to work.\n\nPicture quality and sound are the only 2 good features worth mentioning.",

Thank you hope you like the ( NOKIA TV )",

Felt a little faster than 1 gb ram Motorola tv.\n\nPicture is decent for price under 13k.\n\nCons\nBuggy software.\n\nNo option to set android hope after switch. You have to press home on remote.\n\nSometime does not detect wifi connection. Shows no connection. Gets connected after retrying.\n\nSpotify reboots the TV every time while using or in background. Only does this with Spotify app for me else all apps work ok.",
            "After using 1 month I am going to write this review of Nokia 32inch Smart Tv.\n\nPros-- 1) 1st of all what we look into a TV is display quality. As this tv has VA panel , that's why it has nice contrast ratio as compared to other LED panel TV. If your room is dark or low light then go blindly to this TV.\n2) Brightness: This Tv has 325 nits Brightness which means good compared to others tv where u get 300nits.\n3) Now comes to main Highlighting feature of this Tv, 39 watt onkyo soundbar attached with this tv. Awesome crystal clear sound with thumping bass , really anyone don't need Home Theater. But plz go to audio settings and on surround sound, then u can feel the change.\n4) This Tv comes with 1.5gb RAM whereas others company provide only 1gb ram in this budget.\n5) Minimalist and simple remote with Google assistant.\n\nCons-- 1) As this tv has VA panel, viewing angle of this tv is not good as compared to LED panel. But you can't notice any issue untill you watch tv from extremely wide.\n2) My parents watch tv from DishTV. Normal channel does not looks good in this tv, that's why I have to recharge HD package.\n3) This Tv hasn't Dolbi vision , whereas motorola tv has Dolby Audio + Dolbi vision.\n4) I have some doubt about after sale service of Nokia as this brand is new in TV market.\n\nConclusion: I have purchased this tv with only 11700 rs on BBD.

Amazing sound quality...it beats every other rival at this price range ! Onkyo has done a gr8 job \u2764\ufe0f sometime the video and sound lags but a simple restart would cure it !\n3. Netflix and Amazon Prime works in HD \u270c\ud83c\udffb means it has HDR support...that's a nice thing to have !\n4. It's completely made in India expect for the power cable ...\n\n\nCons:-\n1. I have noticed a bit of heating issue during long usage hours\n2. Bluetooth connectivity is a bit sluggish ... sometimes there are sound drops for 1-2 secs\n3. It would have been provided with WiFi 5 GHz support...but it's fine...it's does it job without any issues on 2.4 GHz ..(.this isn't a con really )\n4. Day to day performance is a bit laggy...not too much ...but on start-up it'll lag for about 10-15 secs then work perfectly...don't expect smartphone levels of smoothness ...rest when the TV is on standby mode ...it works without any lag.\n\nIf this TV fits in ur budget ... go ahead and buy it ! It extremely value for money !!!\n\nHappy Shopping \ud83d\ude0a",

            "Satisfied",
            "Writing a review after a long time. It's gonna be a detailed one as I think after 15 days of continuous usage, I have throughly checked everything. Played around with the settings and this review might help people who have already bought it too. Let's start with the most important thing.\n\n1) Picture quality - 3/5\n\nOk, Here's the catch. Picture quality is not bad but it's not good either. Not comparing it with the likes of LG or Sony, but it fails to surprise me on this part. I like the microdimming feature which keeps the dark scene good but I have noticed colors being blown out when the contrast between the colors are pretty low. Suppose, there are more whites in the background surrounding other light shades, the background would be completely blown out and it would appear completely white leaving the details heavily missing. I also have to continuously change the picture settings depending on whether I'm watching movies, sports, nature trails, etc. For starters, turn off the eco settings and decrease the sharpness for a better visual experience. Increase the saturation and decrease contrast for nature trails and set the color temperature to normal. Set the temperature to warm for movies and cool for sports, but keep the contrast low.\nViewing angle is pathetic and I'm not just exaggerating it. I can see a dullness in color as soon as I move away from the centre of the TV. VA panel is the culprit here.\n\n2) Sound quality -4/5\n\n39W speaker sounds good as much it does on paper. The speaker is loud, you won't need to invest on any Soundbar or music system. But, I would deduct one star for the clarity of the sound. Not saying it's bad, but I have an external speaker and I prefer using that instead of the inbuilt speaker when watching movies. The vocals fade away, and the bass takes over. Good for listening to music but not that great while watching movies.\n\n3) Software - 4.5/5\n\nThe biggest reason why I went with this instead of LG was because of the Android OS. The flexibility to download, install third party apps is impressive. Smooth interface, 1.5Gb ram, 8 GB internal out of which you get around 3.9 gb free. Obviously, you can expand it using a pendrive. The TV lags sometimes while navigating, so you need to clear out RAM if you have opened a lot of apps. If you like to game, you could download Airconsole to play multiplayer games and use your phones as gaming controller.\n\n4) Connectivity - 4.5/5\n\nTried USB, Bluetooth, Ethernet, Wifi, HDMI and they work, but the AUX might be having some problem. I tried connecting my new speakers to the TV through AUX and it was not working properly maybe an issue with my speakers so can't say for sure. Have to check it more. Apart from that, no other issues until now, will update if I have any issues. Wifi 2.4 is a little disappointing though I won't complain at this price.\n\n5) Features - 4.5/5\n\nTwo way Bluetooth is great. It instantly connects to my speakers through Bluetooth or could connect my smartphone with the TV speaker. For all those people saying Chromecast doesn't work, well it works for me. You can download the Google Home app, keep both your TV and phone on the same network and connect it. If nothing works, Google home will come in handy. Uninstall the Chromecast and reinstall it from the play store. Thop TV could be downloaded too through send files to Tv App. Google Assistant is sometimes reluctant to hear my voice but it does the job mostly. Besides, I like the remote, looks premium.\n\n6) After sales service\n\nI can't form an impression in just 15 days, so I would update this in the future. But, the installation/demo person who visited my place, was a part time installer working with Jeeves on per-TV installation basis. Jeeves incentivizes him around 175 INR for a tv installation. He wasn't well-thorough with the TV, just having a basic idea. He installed it well, but he was navigating through the TV as if he was pretty new to using that TV. Not that I'm having a problem as he explained everything I asked for, but this kept me doubting a little about it's after sales service.\n\nAfter 10 days of purchase, few apps were not opening like Disney+ Hotstar, sony-liv, etc. So I called Flipkart and he told me to reinstall the apps, I tried that but it didn't work, so he told me to Factory reset the entire TV and when I asked about how to take backup of all the apps I have installed and all the settings, he told me he was not aware of it. Quite disappointing as when I asked him to send an executive, he told me he can't until I have reset my TV and it's still not working. Sending an executive would be their last resort. So, I guess if I have any issue in the future with the software, they are going to tell me to Factory reset. Just so you know, the problem was with the Ethernet cable I connected my TV with and he didn't even ask me to check that before saying factory reset.\n\nAnyway, I don't regret my decision of buying this TV, it's a good value for money, got it for 12598 with 3 years warranty thing. But, if picture quality matters a lot to you, I think you should go for a different TV. Just add a little more and go for LG or Sony or even MI( you need to check this)",

Android apps and picture quality on youtube Netflix is awesome. No issues in that. Only one major issue is with the dish or cable SD channels. Viewing angles could have been better.

            "After using 3-4 month here are my thoughts\n\nRegarding Tv\nThough the brand is Nokia but tv manufacturer and service provider is from flipkart. Jeeves is there service vendor.\n\nAndroid version:\nStill running on Android 9. Whereas Other brands like Motorola tv are offering Android 10.\n\nFrequency of updates.\n\nAfter first update (received 1 day after purchasing the tv) Prime video and other apps started working. Thats the only update received till date.\n\nConnectivity :\nConnectivity through wifi is good and consistent.\nTo use screen mirroring through mobile i am using Google home. There are no issues with any apps . All are running smoothly.\n\nPicture quality & Sound\nHD content looks good on this tv. Sound is ok & could have been better.\n\nAfter salse service :\nDont expect much as service engineers are clueless. Google assistant was not working on my tv. After giving complaint engineer came to give new remote. That new remote didn't worked either, so he promised that flipkart will provide software update to resolve the issue. Without taking any action he had close the issue.\nAfter few days of waiting I logged a fresh complaint then again same engineer called me and he ordered new remote and promised that software update will come. That update never came but fortunately after replacing the remote 2nd time, Google assistant started working. So I consider services are poor.\n\nPerformance\n\nGood for normal use. Not played any game.\n\nOverall TV is good. Hope Jeeves to improve their service quality and flipkart to provide software update.",

VIEWING ANGLE IS HARDLY 30-45 degrees. Outside that range the colors/visuals changes.\n2. Sound levels drastically came down after the first upgrade. \"Onkyo\" charm went away with that, still sound levels is pretty awesome now.\n3. Wi-fi gets disconnected at times (It often shows \"unable to connect to wi-fi\").\n4. UI BECOMES SLUGGISH after you download couple other apps, trust me you will get the experience of using a 256MB android phone in present world.\n5. PICTURE MODE CHANGES AT TIMES (standard mode to movie mode that too during playback, on changing the setting it sets back to standard)\n6. BRIGHTNESS FLICKERS at times. I am able to replicate this scenario while using ZEE5 app.\n7. POWER RATING is 1 start. Might be due to the 39W (24W speakers+15W tweeters) speaker.\n\nOverall :\nDisplay - 3/5\nSound - 5/5\nUI - 3/5\nConnectivity - 4/5\n\nI am not sure how frequently will Nokia release the future updates to address these issues and provide better experience. It's all your choice to go with Nokia brand. While choosing a TV, I would suggest \"never go with the specs on paper or price, check for the real TV experience\". Belive me you don't need a china phone with great speakers and terrible display.",

If you can spend 1k more go with Moto as providing 2gb ram Nokia 1.5 but rom 16 gb Moto Nokia only 8, and one more thing Android 10 out of the box in Moto where as only 9 in Nokia, service is same as Nokia , Jeeves so go with Moto, then you will think why I took this, because Moto was not available in my pin and no exchange was there for my location which I got with Nokia, if you are unable to buy Moto 2nd option go with nokia\n\nFlipkart service\nVery good delivered on time\nInstalled same day by Jeeves",

Dark colors are okay on screen buy not the bright colors. My family is loving it.\n\nNokia: Please fix whitish tone of the display.\n\n***************************************************\n\nBought it during big billion sale.\n\nSound is loud and has bass. But as I increase the sound it remains low only in first three points then it gets louder on 4 steps, on 4th step it reaches its 80% and then onwards increasing sound almost remains same.\n\nAnother typical issue with sound is it initially dropped and rose but within low range.\n\nI get tear in my eyes if the quality of video is low. The display is so much pixelated. With good connection, quality is good and enjoyable. Colors are not punchy. Kind of whitish and flat picture quality.\n\nBack side is sturdy. Feels like metal, sounds like metal but I am not sure if it's really metal.\n\nAs reviewed by many it is lagging TV. I have to turn off and on sometimes.\n\nAs reviewed by many ... can't login to Amazon Prime. But it looks like an issue with the Amazon.\n\nIs it worth the money?

To be frank, sound clarity and treble supported by those 15 Watts additional tweeters, make it batter than a 10K JBL speaker.\nConnectivity is rocket fast, at least no lag on a hi speed WiFi connection.\nOnly issue is the Prime Video app as mentioned on flipkart.
