            "I got this TV yesterday on 16 Jun 2019. Technician visited for demo and installation within 3 hours of delivery which is fantastic.\n\nObservations\n1. Price for 4K UHD licensed Android TV\n2. Clarity of picture : Great picture quality with SD channels as well. Bright colors and soft on eyes (Probably Samsung A+ panel effect)\n3. Sound : Good with Dolby effect listening to music with Dolby ON is good on ears.\n4. No prime video on Gplaystore, only side load I believe\n5. If you have STB and playing on HDMI input source you need to select SOURCE everytime your TV starts.\n6. Android loads in less than 30 seconds\n7. Complex remote with no guide.\n8. Google assistant button takes you to connect or pair Bluetooth device - probably this gets fixed with sw update instead of Google Assistant.\n\nOverall I am satisfied with the packaging of this TV at this price",
            "1) delivery - on time and installation on same day. 2) picture quality - can play 4K videos very well and clean. 3) sound quality - Dolby dts and 30watt is jem 4) build quality- upto the mark and front design is also good , base look like sound bar attached to the TV 5) value for money and can be more better if they will provide after sales service in future 6) connectivity- quickly connected to any device. if you have high wifi connection, then it will really rock, YouTube, Netflix, play store connects and open quickly. 7) starting time doesn't take much time. even these is any option for fast boot in menu. 8) there are so many options in video settings , please read e manual and try them. 9) colours - colours are bright and do not hurt your eyes. 10) suitable for distance 5ft and above. 11) wall mount stand is good and you can easily connect your hdmi cable as TV set on rod instead of steady wall mount stand. 12) only thing is that when I change my channel from sd to hd , there is something high frequency sound comes out of speakers. in overall TV is amazing. my previous TV was VU. but Thomson and VU are both of same category u can say. at least cheaper than big brands for same features and size. rest is mind set of purchaser. note - always buy extended warranty as panel is most important and expensive part of TV.",
            "good tv, good picture quality , good sound quality, everything is very good",
            "The product is really good and really smart. it has all features of a smart TV, like screen mirroring, Wi-Fi connectivity etc. Display is really good and video quality is quite high. its a good competitor for other high priced TV.",
            "After 4 months use of this TV writing this review. Fisrt I want to share negative things. I have buy 49 inch OATH9000 model. But this TV has no BEE Electricity Power Star(*****) rating. In picture setting options there is no option to reduce or enhanced colour changing options directly. Only u have to choose colour temperament options cool/Standard/warm. Or u have to set the picture colours by changing \"Saturation\" settings. Where difficult to set perfect colour. In online video(Youtube/Netflix) or USB Vedio there are no option to change colour/Brightness label. Which Brightness label is very high, not soothing for ur eye. No pictures mode options like Vivid/Soft/Sport/Cinema/Custom etc. But you can control Brightness indirectly in online videos(Youtube/Netflix) by changing Gama Control Dark/Middle/Bright in pictures setting options before online everytime. To reduce Brightness in online pls keep GAMA at Dark/Midle options. If u power off ur TV then every time you have to select HDMI source to see Set Top Box/DTH connection after power on TV. But if it is in stand by mode then it will automatically choose HDMI source. In Flipcart description 49 inch TV has 30watt speaker, But in manual it is written 10+10 watt Speaker. In Thomson website also written 20 watt. So wrong information in Flipcart. Now I am coming the good things about this TV. 1st of all value for money. 49 inch cost 28000. With 3yrs warranty cost 30000 by SBI card offer. This TV panel is IPS panel and very bright and quality is excellent. Brightness and contrast label is very high. Model look is good specialy with lower bazel soundbar. Sound in very loud and clear, sufficient at label 50% for living room. By adjusting Bass/Trible you can adjust sound output as per ur choice. 4k Vedios is excellent/Vibrant and smooth, No blur issues. HD channels are very good, SD channels are OK. You can't expect excellent view in 49 inch tv of SD chanel. bcoz SD channel resulation is low. But SD is good ok/good. Jeeves service center is available in almost all big/middle town area. No service issues. My town Burdwan jeeva's has service center. Thomson is not upto sony/Sumsung/LG by internal picture settings options. But panel and sound output are good as Sony/Sumsung/LG. Remote of this TV is very user-friendly and full functional. Connentivity also good. Cost is very economical if you compare with Sony/LG/Samsung. In online video if Full HD or 4K ultra it is excellent. I think my review is best in Flipcart. Pls read it before and after purchase ur TV. Subhajit Banerjee-Burdwan.",
            "awesome TV. what a mind blowing features with less cost and very good quality. sounds like home theatre. I watched 4k hollywood movies which was so great it's like a theatre effect. Go blind and buy this TV instead of buying mi, sony, tcl, viu, Lg and samsung. the picture quality was good. what surprise installation done within same day of delivery. wifi, bluetooth and other connectivities was very fast. TV booting very fast and video clarity was awesome. hence I conclude this is going break markets of mi, sony, lg and other TV companies. this is going lead entire television market in India future. kindly go for it and encourage thomson company it is India product.",

            "The picture quality is amazing and at par with premium brands like Sony, Panasonic ( I have been using them before this TV) and sound is so pleasant with Dolby / DTS certified speakers.The only limitation I observed is no ARC for HDMI support. Otherwise, the best TV and value for money in terms of product. Good job by Thomson and recommend this TV for everyone, instead of wasting money by paying premium for other brand TVs in the market. I am sure Thomson TVs will give tough competition to competitors in the industry. Need to see how Thomson will provide after sales support, which is key for their success.",
            "Overall product is GOOD, Sound is really too good with DTS & Dolby system. Picture quality is best at this price that too 4K. Casting works superb with Google Home app in Mobile.

            "Downgrading my rating to the lowest possible due to Thomson's pathetic after sales service.\nThis is related to the Thomson after sales service which is absolutely pathetic! I had an issue with the TV and required a Tech visit for repair/support. I even paid Rs550 for Tech visit as the TV is not in Warranty, but no one turned or even cared to contact me even after two weeks. Their toll free number is also unresponsive. Only thing that works is their Chat support, who escalate the issue to the concerned team and then someone just sends a mail saying they will work on the issue. But then it is back to same waiting game. I can't understand this level of apathy to one's own business. These guys probably outsourced their after sales support totally to third parties with absolutely no control over them or their SLAs. I guess it is a mistake to try with Thomson TV. It is better to stick to high quality brands like Sony, Samsung etc even if we have to go to higher price points.\n\n-----------\nGot the TV in 2 days from the day of order and installation was done professionally on the next day. Have been using the TV for 3 days now. Picture quality is superb. So far watched some high quality YouTube videos and very happy with the picture and sound quality. I haven't yet explored much of the video and audio options but the default itself is very good. Was able to easily connect to wifi and the apps. Actually pretty impressed with the signal reception on wifi both 2.4g and 5g. Yet to explore how to use Google assistant.",
            "TV is Good. Good Colors..\nAwesome clarity when playing 4K videos from YouTube.\n\nYou can control TV With Google android TV Remote via Phone..\nIt can connect Multiple devices same time with BlueTooth..\nIt has Voice Remote .. Pretty Good.\nPure Android.. No Bloatware or Anything..\n\nI haven't faced any Problem with TV Yet in last 7 Days.\n\nFew things i miss is..\nThey are claiming it has 30 W Speaker but Manual says it has 10W + 10 W two speakers.. So its just 20 W.. There No mention about Audio on TV Box.\n\nAmazon Prime video is not Available on Google Play Store but i have side Loaded ..\nSound is average.. Picture Quality is awesome..\n\nBut One More Important Thing is That \"TV is Manufactured India By Indian Company Which Hold License of French Brand. \"",
            "i ordered 49\" 4K Android tv and next day they delivered tv. Installation was also done on same day.but due to technical issue while starting Tv , i requested replacement.. They replaced the earlier tv with New Thomson Tv same model within 4 days..Now new Thomson TV is playing good and there is no issue... Picture quality n sound quality is very good..It has connectivity options like inbuilt Chromecast. Google voice assistance works well.. Overall good 4k Android Tv within this budget.",
            "i got this tv on 26 june i really impressed with the tv quality, my main uses of tv is watching uhd content and playing ps4, it is not a 10bit its 8bit panel, no HDR option in tv,not satisfied with tv speaker no detail and clear sound in speaker. Go for vu android tv it has 10 bit and HDR TV.",
            "Review after one week.\nThe best 4K Android TV in this price range.\nGreat picture quality and decent sound. No issue with connectivity.\nIssues faced are some YouTube videos appears with motion blur, may need to change picture settings like noice reduction manually to solve that issue and sound is not clear in low volume.\nOverall I am happy with the product.\nOn other hand Jeeves delayed installation by one day.",
            "Amazing TV, with excellent picture quality.....worth every penny.... Fast and excellent service by Flipkart / Thomson....same day they done the TV installation as well.....fully satisfied with the product and service by Flipkart.",
            "my observations\n1.picture quality is good. 4k movies look real. Hd content is also clear.\n2.you can sideload prime video. It works flawlessly.\n3. Bluetooth connectivity is superb.\n4.google assistant works good but not excellent.\n5.remote requires to be paired with TV through Bluetooth. installation boy was not aware of that. He took two hours to install TV. then he made video call to his senior who guided him how to pair TV with remote.\n6. Google assistant works only after pairing remote with TV.\n7.overall good value for money product.\n8. IPS panel helps in better picture in any viewing angle.\n9. Good competition to vu premium android.\n10. sound is good but not excellent. but I have external Bluetooth stereo system. so no need to worry , as it supports Bluetooth.\n11. I can watch movies at night even my family sleeping in same room as it can be paired with Bluetooth headset.\n12. please don't waste money on Sony, Samsung, LG , they will cost 25k extra for same specifications\n13. 2.5 GB ram is highest in competition.16 GB storage is also highest in competition. No lag or hang due to powerful processed.\nYOU WILL BE HAPPY PURCHASING THIS PRODUCT.",
            "Nice TV in this price range with good connectivity options. Decent picture & sound quality. Initially had some sound cracking issues while playing youtube videos. But after changing the Wifi band to 5hz on router, things were good. Installation was good. Giving 4. as I had to request a replacement for missing accessories & it took over 10 days to get replaced. Also missing Prime video & sideloading it does not play HD quality. Please include Prime Video & also update the OS to 9.0 to be latest & greatest. Overall a nice product compared to MI & Motorola Tvs.",
            "Completely satisfied with the TV. Display quality is awesome. Sound is excellent. Connectivity is quick and fast and stable. Chromecast feature is working fine without any issue. Earlier used MI TV and I can say that Thomson TV is 100% better than MI TV in all aspects.",
            "Since last 2 days i have been experienced very good with this newly bought Thomson TV. it was installed within 2 days of delivery. quality is good. moreover we are looking forward to have good experience. Very good product with this price.",
            "Both video and audio quality is excellent. Videos watched in youtube in 4k are awesome in quality and the sound quality is at its best. Each colour has its own depth and is unique from others. Major advantage is its 2.5GB ram and 16GB rom(internal storage). Dont think too much, one of the best tv's at this price tag. If your budget is arround 30k, just go for it..",
            "Quite happy with the product and the experience regarding flipkart's delivery and installation.\nPicture quality is really good.. 4k and hd video rendering is great.. sd content is also quite decent\n\nSound quality is also quite good..\n\nTV built looks strong and durable.\n\nA good variety of apps already available and the android support makes it very easy and convenient.",
            "Really Superb, Pictures Quality is awesome, Connectivity also Fine, 2.5 GB ram really super in fast & Smooth no lacking, Sorrouding Speaker out put really Super. I think no one Issue in this TV, really High End TV in Low Cost thank you Thomson. I seen Some Channel in Old TV not in view Good, but I am Watching same Channel in this TV Picture are fine with Upscaling for Example in Cricket match live coverage. Really Worth of Money.",
            "I bought the 43 inch model (43 OATH 1000) . Here are my observations:\n\n1. Picture quality particularly on Full-HD and 4K-HD modes are excellent. Below full-hd, you better use a good DTH service rather than local-cable.\n\n2. 30 W speakers are very good with excellent sound quality.\n\n3. I bought it on 10-07-2019. The delivery was on the next day, and installation was the day after that. OK, but it could have been faster.\n\n4. The service manuals, both E-manual and booklet supplied with TV need to be improved. Many functions are not explained properly.\n\n5. For using voice on Google assistant, the remote has to be paired to TV using bluetooth, which is not at all explained in both the manuals. Even the installation technician was unaware. I found the procedure online through google search.\n\n6. If your TV uses the same google account as your android phone, then there are some advantages, including better voice-recognition, installing TV apps through your home computer, etc.\n\n7. Overall, my initial experience is very good.",
            "I purchased the TV 2 months back. Following points are my take on the product.\n1. The Sound Quality (30 W) (8/10)\n2. Picture Quality Ultra HD 4K (8/10)\n3. Non 4k Quality ( 7.5/10)\n4. Looks : Plain and Simple\n5 Power Consumption: Low and affordable (9/10)\n6. Over-the top (OTT) Apps: Netflix, HotStar, SonyLiv, Youtube, Google Play Store , (Prime Video is not available need to download .apk for installation)\n7. Heating : no such heating problem observed in past 2 months\n8. Reboot time : 8-10 secs\n9. Display Panel : As per specs is A+ ( Gives you nice viewing angle, IPS could have been better, but you will barely be able to feel any difference)\n\n\nOverall the product is worth buying taking cognizance of the Selling Price. Wont regret.",

            "Purchased this TV within few days of its launch through exchange. Flipkart guys rejected my old tv saying that it has a light horizontal line. But I think it was default with the tv. Had to pay extra amount to get this TV\n\nTv has android latest feature. Sound bar in front of the tv gives a grand look. not many apps in Google play store. But you can install external apps using fs explorer.\n\nNeed improvement of Prime tv app with this tv. Other than this very good tv at this rate.\n\npros\nGood picture quality\nGood sound",
