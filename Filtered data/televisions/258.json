            "What an amazing tv it has everything the budget tv should have .

            "Great product at the price.. Operating is simple remote is bluetooth connected ..( no IR Sensor)which I liked it very much Google assistant voice commands make it easy for operating.Bluetooth. earphones can be connected.inbuilt chrome cast&phone mirroring works like charm.picture quality is great.",
            "The picture quality of the tv is good and the audio is also good .\n\nThere are small bezels in the sides that is ok.\n\nthe hands free audio system is not upto par but is okish",
            "After using it for almost 2 weeks. below are the pros and cons.\nPros.\n1)amazing picture quality.\n2)upscaling to 4k is also fantastic.\n3)tv unit looks beautiful.\n4)almost bessel less display.\n5)sound is really loud.\n\nCons\n1)doesn't support 5g bandwidth.\n2)Play Store doesn't have many options of good apps to be downloaded. (it's not like Google Play Store in our phones. There are very limited options for apps.)\n3)TV runs a bit slow while switching between apps.\n4)not sure if it has Dolby Atmos as didn't feel the surround sound.\n\nAfter using for 2 months\nThe remote stopped working if the TV is on standby mode overnight. I have to switch off the main and switch it on again for it to work.\n\nAll the other apps stopped working showing no internet whereas Netflix works completely fine even then.",
            "I have been using this Tv for about 2 days and the Tv is working perfectly, very good pictures quality screen and everything is good that i think it\u2019s a very nice Tv the estimate \ud83d\ude0d",
            "Excellent purchase worth for every penny paid. Quality of the product is at par with Sony, Samsung and similar. Mesmerizing experience to watch 4K video's and Hd videos.l",
            "I had been looking for a 4k 55 inch UHD for long time and after going around TV showrooms , following is what i observed.\n1.

The look of the TV is top notch, bezzels are very thin and it adds extra beauty to your room. Picture clarity is something very special in this TV, such a smooth and clear picture plus stunning color reproduction. Particularly the 4k videos are very crisp and detailed. Picture presets are helpful and useful while watching movies, in one click it takes you to next level of watching. Sound is loud and clear I haven't tried the full volume yet, it produces that much Sound. It is a most recommended product.

Even the OnePlus u1s tv doesn't stand a chance against this one. It's really cheap for its features and size.\n\nAmazing picture quality, contrast and connectivity. It doesn't have the 5 gigs wifi band but you don't need it because the 2.5 gigs band can easily play any 4k video without lag.\nAlso, it has android so you get many apps which you won't get in other OS TV's.\nIt's worth the price.",

I've had a 1.25Gb RAM on my previous TV so in comparison it is much quicker.\n\nI haven't installed a lot of applications.\nI use Netflix, prime and hotstar. No issues to report.\n\nFinally, I did a lot of research before I decided to buy this TV the number 1 TV on my wishlist was the VU Premium TV which was always unavailable. This was the next best TV so I decided to go ahead with the purchase and I can say I am very happy with the purchase because I got a good deal for this TV during the big billion sale.",

Audio quality is awesome, thanks to Dolby Audio and 30W stereo box. 10/10\n\n2. Picture Quality is good, best in this price range with 4K HDR, micro dimming, dynamic color enhancement, 9/10.\n\n3. Memory: 2GB Ram(On iffalcon website, few days ago it was mentioned 1gb by mistake but rectified now), 16GB HD, Android 9. TV released on 6th Aug 2020, so you will have all the latest updates already preconfigured. 9/10\n\n4. Connectivity: Bluetooth v5, WI-FI, HDMI, USB, Voice control, Chromecast etc. In most of the Android 9 TV'S you will find Wi-Fi connectivity issues, I personally see this in MI and Kodak TV that once you re-start the TV, it doesn't detect the Wi-Fi automatically. I didn't find the issue in this TV.\nWI-FI 5ghz band is missing. 9/10.\n\n\nOverall 9.25/10",

            "I love the pure Android experience on the TV. I was having a Thomson smart tv before and it had its own set of apps, not pure android. This TV comes with an inbuilt Chromecast that makes it easy for casting from your mobile phones. I've connected the TV via Wifi and haven't faced any connection issues so far. It also has an ethernet port. The picture quality is very good for the price we pay, even though black pixels could be darker in more expensive models. Overall I'm satisfied with the TV. I would strongly suggest purchasing the extended warranty that Flipkart offers. If the panel of any LED TV is damaged, it's almost impossible to repair, or will cost 70-80% of the TV cost. The extra warranty assures peace of mind for 3 years.",

            "I was looking for Vu or Hisense TV for a month and they never came into stock. Vu was available for Rs 31000 three months ago, but at that time I wasn't looking to buy a TV. When I decided to buy most of the TVs were not in stock. I was looking at Nokia, Motorola, Iffalcon and Thomson. Vu tv gets most of its components from Hisense. Vu only puts the parts together in India. Same goes with Thomson and Kodak (same company assembles both the TVs). Hence, I decided to go for Iffalcon TV from TCL, which is in industry for a long time. In my opinion, Samsung/Sony/LG are way too pricey for the same features. On top of that TV technology changes so fast and not worth spending so much money just for a few advantages. The rate of depletion is also high on electronics.\n\nAll the sellers increased the price a week before the sale and gave some discount. Worst big billion days sale, for sure.\n\nI bought the TV for 34750 (with SBI discount).\n\nAbout TV......\n\nThe bezels of the TV are tiny and almost invisible. TV is light weight and comes with the wall mount.\n\nThe picture quality is great, but I feel brightness is a bit lower (300 nits). It looks bright on 100% brightness, but this deteriorates the longevity. Always good to set it to 50-60.\n\nThe sound quality is great with 30W speakers. Good for any hall size honestly. There is a good bass as well.\n\nConnectivity is good with a single band wifi. There was no lag playing 4K videos with internet speed of 100 Mbps. But, when you first turn on the TV, the apps don't load fast. There is a slight delay and you will only see it when you first turn on the TV.\n\nTV looks bad with SD quality channels as expected. Either have an HD box or watch prime videos to enjoy the clarity.\n\nInstallation guy from Jeeves wasn't so great. He just installed it and didn't demonstrate all the features of the TV.\n\nI will update the review again in the future after exploring in more detail.",
            "Has a very premium finish and look. Picture quality and sound are very good compared to other budget TVs in this range. Go for it. Don\u2019t trust Jeeves service though. They are pathetic and cheaters. I did self installation.",

Prime video can't play 4k properly. The sound doesn't match up with the video. The processor and graphics is weak basically. I don't get why they are calling it a smart TV. Only option for me now is to get fire stick 4k and plug it in and use this TV as just a screen. Need to spend another 5k extra. Wish I'd just bought the Mi TV and not some unknown brand. So save your money and buy anything but this pathetic excuse of a smart TV",

Connectivity remains a concern, with 40MBPS unlimited WiFi plan I am still facing video buffering issues, please look into this matter\n\n2. Bluetooth connectivity also is not best amongst the TVs of this price range, gets disconnected frequently\n\n3. Not best to use with set top box even if you own HD plus, deranged picture quality obtained. I would suggest to use this only for OTT and YouTube along with gaming.\n\n\nIn summary\nThis is the best piece amongst available options as far as android TVs are concerned. Good for gaming!\nBang for the buck",

Look of the TV is good especially the bazelless frame.\n2. Picture quality is decent. There was no issues in playing 4k videos. Also nice experience with movies, sports and gaming.\n3. Sound quality is ok. Speakers are quite loud but lacks punch.\n4. Setup is quite easy and it takes almost 15-20 sec to boot it up every time when the main power is switched off.\n5. Google assistance for both remote and TV is ok, not great I would say.\n6. Connectivity is decent. No issues while connecting to wifi and bluetooth headphones.\n7. Was delivered on time and installation was done within next 2 days.\n\ncons-\n1.Specifications on iffalcon site and on flipkart are different. On its official site other than micro dimming no other feature is mentioned. So its not clear about TV characteristics and also its customer care guys (I got connected after a lot of tries) has no idea.\n2.TV remote is bad, too small with hard keys and has no mute button.\n3.Surprisingly there are no picture and sound options (almost every other brand provides this).\n4.Screen sharing is bad when playing videos.\n5.Single band wifi.(It did not bother me though)\n\nOverall I would say a decent product in this price range.",

Picture quality is super 10 out of 10.. upscaling is v good 480p videos also play in good quality... We can sit in less distance also no blurr... color, blacks, brightness is also super i hav kept only 30 level then also fully bright... Don't listen to YouTubers some people saying that 270 nits means less brightness actually i was not buying this product only for 270 nits brightness but after i heard one YouTuber and taken risk of buying...its a great tv like brands tv screen no complaint at all.\n3. Connectivity also 10/10. Takes 1 min for auto wifi and bluetooth connection but its normal in all\n4. 55 inch is not large screen its correct for medium halls\n5.its bezel is super ... Not visible from 6 feet also if we go near then also very small bezels look like premium\n6.super smooth operation... Number of applications we can install no lagginess\n7 light weight\n8. Far field voice recognition (hands free remote)is also superb ... Till 8 feet it can operates smoothly above that range we have to speak loud... Remote also good...\n9. Picture visible from 180 degree also...\n10. Jeeves service is very good and technician explained and supported for all queries correctly 10/10\n11. Flipkart service as like before 10/10\n\nCons....\n\n1. Default and only 1 gle sound setting... No equaliser\n2. 3.5 mm jack audio out has low sound ... If we play sound on tv speaker if its 100% means from 3.5 mm jack is 60%... Disappointed fully .. and from bluetooth also same...\n3. I don't think its AI tv because no more option is given ...
