            "Brand is Acer so buying a SMART TV in it was a no brainer.\nBought the product on the 25nd and got the delivery on the 31th.\nAHS came and installed it on the same day.\nObservations so far\n1. Amazing picture quality, with natural full colours and brightness, is really great\n2. Operating system is android working well\n3. Sound output is what impressed me the most. Amazing sound for a TV in this segment.\n4. Remote is sleek and easy to use. Hotkeys for Netflix & Prime are helpful. Something new in Tikilive so let's see.\n5. Few buttons on the remote will only work when the system is updated to android 11, but it is no big deal.\n6. Can do a better job with the installation and demo. They rescheduled once and then came in late.\nSuper happy with the product and will recommend it without a doubt.\nGreat job Acer again.",
