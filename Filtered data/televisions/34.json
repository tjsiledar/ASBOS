            "Value for money\nGood product for Thomson an Indian brand picture quality is good sound quality is good and overall good performance at it\u2019s best and delivery by flipkart is also mentionable",
            "Really interesting that Thomson is providing such a great gadget in the lowest price along with great support.\n\nAs we know an electronic item can break down any time but it is the after sales support which makes you feel happy or regret. But take it from me that you will definitely be delighted to the support from Thomson.\n\nThere's no question asked situation for the picture quality, sound. However I was in trouble as the pen drives were not being detected after a few days, for which I can the call center and technician totally replaced the entire card with a new one in place of repairing what other do.\n\nI am really impressed and do recommend everyone.",
            "It's not at all HD ready LED TV, I feel like it's LCD or lower version TV screen, picture quality is like 15 year old TV, sounds is also like old style, there is nothing great in this TV except price is lower but what to do if quality is bad. I wouldn't recommend to buy this TV at all.",

            "Value for money\nGood product for Thomson an Indian brand picture quality is good sound quality is good and overall good performance at it\u2019s best and delivery by flipkart is also mentionable",
            "Really interesting that Thomson is providing such a great gadget in the lowest price along with great support.\n\nAs we know an electronic item can break down any time but it is the after sales support which makes you feel happy or regret. But take it from me that you will definitely be delighted to the support from Thomson.\n\nThere's no question asked situation for the picture quality, sound. However I was in trouble as the pen drives were not being detected after a few days, for which I can the call center and technician totally replaced the entire card with a new one in place of repairing what other do.\n\nI am really impressed and do recommend everyone.",
            "It's not at all HD ready LED TV, I feel like it's LCD or lower version TV screen, picture quality is like 15 year old TV, sounds is also like old style, there is nothing great in this TV except price is lower but what to do if quality is bad. I wouldn't recommend to buy this TV at all.",
            "Awesome led by thomson , very good product , i bought it only for 6399/- and i am proud to be own this, value for money product , if you are looking for 32 inch led tv then just go for it, it will never let you down.",
            "No one given clear review abt thomson R 9 32inch non smart .picture too bright color not face clear too much lagging pixel quality &usb connectivity very worst.not able to play any video not supporting any of the format .sound is good.installation person very worst.he is trying to selling mounting extra.worst installation person from jeeves customer services",
            "The television set is awesome. Very Light weight set. Picture quality is really awesome- both in SD channels and HD channels. It can handle 720 pixels and 1080 pixels both resolutions remarkably. Sound quality is very loud and clear. Dolby surround sound output is however not supported- still provides good acoustics.\n\nThe remote unit is a bit less responsive- you have to put it near the TV set for getting a proper response as it is infrared based remote. 4 picture modes and 4 sound modes are there in the tv set. You can choose as per your requirements. Tv unit supports most video formats when using an external pen drive or hard disk for viewing any videos or movies.\n\nDelivery and Installation is fast- full support from Flipkart partner (Jeeves) for installation. However, I received my TV unit without the wall mount- which was an error on the seller's part.\n\nOverall satisfied with the quality of the product till now (have been using for 5 days).\n\nFull Value for money if you want to buy a tv set within 10k range.",
            "Valuable Product at this price point, good job Thomson\nPlz improve delivery on 32 inches or higher screen TV, only 24inch TV available most of pincode.",
            "The tv has good sound and picture quality.The wall mounts are of poor quality and installation support was not provided.Keep this in mind while purchasing it.But its picture quality is better than the Marq 24 inch full hd tv.\nSo,overall its a satisfactory purchase.",
            "Clarity is good . Worthy and recommended to buy.",
            "THOMSON is one of the great old brand. I know this brand from my childhood. This TV has lots of features. Power saving mode is one of the great feature (Uploaded 2 different power save mode images). Everything is good except sound. When we are increasing level (0 - 100) of volume after 20 there are limited volume increasing. Otherwise this tv is great.",
            "1. If you play 720P MP4 in USB {Pen Drive}, TV itself Hangs. You need to switch of directly otherwise TV will not work\n2. Video Quality is like nood , Clarity is worst.\n3. Build Quality Is Avg\n4. There is no return , only Replacement with same TV",
            "Nice TV for HD 720p content and works very well on HD channels or Internet run device like fire stick or cromecast",
            "This Tv is spl for Mommy i don't need an smart TV for them bcz elderly people jus wanted to watch when they switch on the TV at once so this TV is very nice. Installation was on time. Delivery was safe too. I bought this on offer time it's very useful for me.",

            "The TV is perfect buy at a very reasonable price. I had opted for this as my second TV in home as my son does not allow to use the other TV. The colours are bright, sound Is loud enough. Sharpness in picture could have been better but can be managed. The delivery by Flipkart was on schedule and installation team came right next day. All in all I am happy using the product.",
            "Much better than marq TV in this price range.Bcoz I have used both. Wall mounting is too simple.No metal or supporting brackets provided.Only 2 small clamps available for mountings.Over all as of now really happy with this product.",
            "Not worth the money. Sound is not very clear. Just don't go for this product, since it is cheap. I made a huge mistake in buying this. Should have out in some more money and bought other TV which cost around 12.5k. They seem to be much better in terms of picture and sound quality. Horrible decision. Picture contrasts are very high, and good DSLR images are also not very good to look at via this TV. Do NOT buy, totally not recommended.",
            "Best LED TV ever because it's a perfect LED TV",
            "BELOW 7000 VERY WORTH TV.\n1. NICE SOUND\n2. NICE PICTURE\n\nOVER ALL GOOD",

            "really amazing tv for the price... picture quality for the price is amazing there is one setting needs to be off after that best tv under 10k...",
            "I stay at Mumbai thane and Delivery was really fast in 2 days and securely packed... Thomson R9 24\" is not a Full HD screen but as the size is small 24 inch so the given pixel ratio (HD Ready) is enough for it.. can clearly display 1080p video... Sound is ok, connectivity with multiple options good...Remote control works fine but some smart buttons are non operational on it for this model... Got it in just 6500/- coz of the amazing offer given by flipkart really value for money... I am satisfied... Thanks Flipkart...\n\nNote: I guess installation not included by the company need to be done on your own cost as I did, coz after purchase there was no proactive call made by Thomson or flipkart for installation.",
            "Review of 24 inch tv. Bought at 7499 to gift someone. Used it for a week.\nPicture quality is very good. Brightness and Colors are good. More than what I expected. I likes picture quality more than mi tv.\n\nSound is very. Nice, clear and enough loud for Tv programs, news and movies.

            "I've got a 43\" Mi TV added to cart. But not available till date. Got this as standby for watching the World cup and really amazed when I connected my laptop through HDMI. It was more awesome when I hooked up the TATA SKY. Watched some real good colors from GotG2 via Hotstar. Just buy it. Best TV for less than 15k. I also compared to a VU 32 inch, but image processing is really sharp. Loving it.",

            "This TV is a better replacement for old CRT televisions.\nThe picture quality is above average.\nSound quality is average (Sound quality issues occur at 100% volume).Better to keep at 80%\nIt has two USB slots..But they are of no use because it does not play most of the modern .mkv files.Also we can see a lag in the picture if we play movies having file size of 1 GB or more.\n\nNote: Thomson is offering extend warranty for their televisions..To avail this the customer have to contact the support team over email with the invoice.They charges 1000 rupees for 1 year extension and 1800 for 2 year extended warranty.\n\nIt is a value for money product if you only planning to use this along with set top box.",

Cons:: picture quality is a major set back. it says hd ready but it is nowhere near the picture qualities of hd ready tvs of LG, SONY, etc. (No wonder those tvs are not available at these rates!) The switch on light in the tv and the remote signal receiving unit are on left corner of the tv model projecting out from lower edge. This looks a little out of place. Over all, this tv is a good buy if you are searching in lower price range!",
