            "Best TV in 55000 Qled TV mi others brand 1lakh above like Sony sumsung LG my opinion is middle class family best TV go for it",
            "Happy with the TV overall experience. Price vs performance is acceptable. It's slim as expected. Picture of QLED is okay. I believe when you pay more for other brands the depth, contrast, brightness and clarity can be better than this TV, nevertheless this is acceptable. Similar experience is with Sound quality. It may have been better. This both feedback is based on my earlier 32 inch LG LED TV of 2011, which had better sound and picture. My rating is purely from price vs performance point of view. Recommendations go for flexible arm type wall mounted unit (Rs.1700) for ease rear access. Fixed one (Rs.500) is of no use. So have this in budget.",
            "It is a decent product at this price point. It's advantageous to have the latest hardware that is future proof. One of the drawbacks is that the video settings aren't quite set right by default and would require manual setup for best viewing experience.\nAlso, bluetooth pairing is a bit flaky.",

            "Great tv at a budget price. Had to go through a lot of reviews before landing on this tv. But it's amazing that MI is able to provide a 75 inch tv at this price range. That too QLED. But the only con is the small lags we encounter while switching through apps and changing settings. This is because of the low Ram memory on this device. Mi could have added a 4Gb ram instead of a 2 Gb ram for a tv of such dimension. Anyhow to sum it up Mi QLED 75 inch is a great buy.",
            "I dont write reviews often but this tv and flipkart forced me to write this review. Initially i found some software bugs in the tv and due to which i asked flipkart for replacement. Flipkart people assisted me and arranged a mi teqnician visit. And mi people came and upgraded the software and asked me to use tv for three days than give feedback. In the same time flipkart people was in touch with me to resolve my query. They are keen to get thing resolved. Meanwhile i got corona positive and havent used a tv during that time. But flipkart people was in contact with me and considered my problem as rare case and assured me for resolution . During that time i haven't used this tv but when i got healthy i start watching this tv and fallen in love with the quality of this tv. Picture quality 10/10 sound 10/10 connectivity 10/10 and flipkart people support is 20/10 they have considered my case with patience. And given me time to get healthy and then try to resolve the problem. Thankyou flipkart and Mi India. Experience of buying this tv is better than offline store",
            "The best quality tv that you can purchase in this range !.\nThe blacks are stunning , amazed at the screen quality . I don\u2019t have much idea about the software because that is solved by my Apple TV . If u are looking for Samsung and LG and major brands for much better picture quality. I think you need to consider this tv because for the price,where most of the tv cost more than 2-6lakhs this one is perfect for the price that the customer pays , for better performance , u can buy an Apple TV which can solve the performance issues . Happy movie watching !!",
            "Excellent TV! Don't think about it, just buy it.\n\nWould definitely recommend it over -\nRedmi X55, MI TV4X, and other LED TVs from Vu, Hisense, LG, Samsung (overpriced).\n\nMy main criteria for getting this was -\nBetter colours, deeper blacks.\n\nSo does it actually show better colours and deeper blacks when compared to other LED TVs?\n\nAbsolutely! The colours are at least 10-12% more vibrant compared to normal LED TVs, and the black uniformity is excellent as well. There's no unnecessary grey spread.\n\nMany TVs out there say they have Wide Color Gamut, but how much? Most LED TVs provide 85-92% NTSC colour space. This covers 100% of that, which means it covers all visible colours (I guess). The picture looks crisp (4k), colour volume is great, and deeper blacks ensures excellent contrast.\nIt's still not OLED level blacks, but much much better than Redmi TVs, where many TVs have a very high light bleed issue, and in dark scenes the picture looks outright grey. Thankfully not on this TV, black looks like black and that makes it the best TV under 60k for use in bedrooms which are usually kept dark.\n\nI was confused about this with Redmi X55, Vu TVs, but the additional 15k over normal LED TV is with it since you buy a TV to keep it for at least 5-6 years, so you should buy the absolute best picture quality keeping your budget in mind.\n\nMy first choice was an OLED TV but super expensive, second choice was Samsung QLED, excellent but again expensive and based on Tizen, so MI gives you the best for the price.\n\nI would have added images for dimming test and 4k videos, but trust me, it won't be accurate. You need to see it to understand it.",
            "Picture quality is excellent except red color appearance. Red colour appearance is of showing bright red which is not et al cool. Sound is not upto the mark as per the tv size. Except these two things this TV is extremely good. I love watching it.",
            "Superb product, very good picture quality you really like the product , this is the best QLED at this price.",
            "This TV is a must buy for the price! No other QLED TV are available in this price range. Feature wise the newer MiTVs are very good and no complains. The picture quality is just amazing, and the TV does an excellent job to upscale standard images into some form of UHD compatible images. Colour range and contrast is decent, and sound quality is much better than 40 inch Mi TVs. Definitely buy this if you're looking for a 4K UHD QLED TV within your budget!",

            "An absolutely Masterpiece for the price. Don't compare with LG, Samsung and the King Sony. There are jitters but you can live with it but not as much as an LED TV. Got it for 51k in the sale.\n\nI have ample sunlight in my Livingroom and there is absolutely no color and picture loss. That's why QLED is better.",
            "Will start with the cons, as pros are widely reported anyways:\n\n1. Mi Quick Mute feature (double tap on volume down button to mute) doesn't work. Checked with another friend, same issue. A feature advertised on their website should work out of the box. Right now, to mute, I need to keep the volume down button pressed for at least 2 to 3 seconds, which is very inconvenient.\nRest of the additional features like quick wake, quick access work as expected.\n\n2. Motion smoothing is a hit and miss. When it works, its an excellent feature. But sometimes in apps like Disney and prime video, it stutters during fast paced scenes. Hence, I have kept it off.\n\n3. UI is sometimes laggy. For eg. occasionally on pressing the home button from inside an app, it takes like 4 to 5 seconds to respond. I have used MiBox4 before this, and the UI there was very fluid and responsive.\n\nAll these issues can be fixed via software. Apparently there was an OTA update which was rolled out a few months back for the quick mute issue, but it was rolled back.\nThe software team should release an update soon to fix these issues, as the rest of the hardware is great, and the experience is a bit of a let down due to the software.\n\n4. (Not directly related to the TV) Delivery was on time, but installation by Flipkart was done after 6 days. For 6 days, the big 55 inch box had to be kept in my house, which was troublesome. Installation for such a high value product shouldn't take more than 2 or 3 days.\n\nPros:\n\n1. Picture quality, sound quality is awesome.\n\n2. Motion smoothing looks great for watching sports.\n\n3. Build quality seems good. Ports are easily accessible.\n\n3. 32GB internal storage with approximately 25GB usable space comes handy, as external 4k x265 files are usually at least 10 to 15GB for 2 hour content.\n\nTL;DR: Great hardware, below par software, which could catch up with an update, but don't count on it while making your decision. Buy for what it is when you buy.\n\nDisclaimer: This review is after using the TV for a day, after exploring all possible settings available. Used with internet based apps, laptop, pendrive, not tested with set top box.",
            "This TV is complete pack.\n\nIts support 5tb harddisk (HHD).\nIts support h.265 1080p.\nIts support all vedio formates with default player.\nNo need to install MX player or vlc player.",
            "Excellent Product and Experience\nmy research for months and finally deciding to buy this TV really paid off. QLED is different experience altogether. The picture quality is something that I have not seen before. I have upgraded from a 32 inch to a massive 55 inch TV now, upgrading from a normal 5-6 years old normal LED TV to QLED TV picture quality is amazingggg . I have this placed in my well-lit (natural as well as artificial) drawing, room, yet never felt any discomfort while watching it during day or night time. The sound quality and decibel is nice enough for a normal user like me, not a music enthusiast. I am more a video quality person, then sound and this is a wonderful treat to my eyes.",
            "The panel is really good, as good as Samsung qled. But the software is really buggy. I am facing many problems with the software. Youtube works ok, but Netflix and many other apps are very buggy. If you really want to enjoy this tv, I think you should purchase a streaming device such as fire-stick 4k.",
            "Absolutely amazing picture quality, beats a new Sony x9000h 65\" panel, and completely trounce the new vu 65\". The OS is smooth, all apps work fine, the remote is small and very functional. The sound is the only disappointment, but for that I bought a Sony HT-RT3 5.1 and connected it via the arc hdmi port.\n\nHighly recommended for those looking for a big tv experience with superb picture clarity.",

            "One of the reasons for choosing the TV was the mi software, but with the default app, movies playing on this tv does not look like it's getting shoot on movie camera, but more like watching serial on local channel. Rest of the things seems to be so far good. One relieving thing is that with fire stick 4k, the picture looks fine",

Value for money qled in 55 inch.lowest price compare to tcl or one plus tv.\n2.picture quality is Best on 4k videos or hd channels.\n3.brightness is amazing.Colors r natural looking.\n4. HDR 10,Dolby Vision r there\n5.Sound is on mid volume crispy and clear.In high volume surround sound effects come.bass is feel in loud volume.not sound disturbance in full volume.no need of sound bar to listen music .I have boat avante120 watt sound bar but tv speaker gives natural sound.2 arc port and 1 earc port.1aux.1 optical cord.digital Dolby sound support.\n6.Deigning is much premium look with metal finish.\n7.Mi after sale service is good.so go for it without any confusion if ur budget around 50000rs.\nCons.\n1.white color is too much vibrant in back ground.\n2.No alexa support.",
            "The purchase and delivery was quick. The installation was done by a polite technician and handled well.\nThe TV is a good step up to the ordinary UHD TVs but a shade below the more expensive models of Sony, Samsung etc.\nFor my purpose the TV has good picture colour and clarity, Looks nice on the wall and works well with my soundbar. The two features that I wanted and got in this model over other budget QLEDs is eARC and dual band with 5Ghz support.\nThe remote is disappointing but tolerable. Haven't explored all features (patchwall) as it's mainly used for Netflix/Prime and I get Dolby vision, UHD/4K picture and Dolby DD+ surround sound on my JBL 9.1 soundbar. Surprisingly the inbuilt apps don't offer Dolby atmos. Checked this with Amazon's firestick and found better picture resolution and Atmos sound, which the in built apps don't provide. So if it's hooked to your AV HT, then better to avoid in built apps for movies for 7.1/Dolby Atmos effects.\nOverall, a good purchase for budget conscious and brand indifferent TV customers.",
            "Great TV.. everything works great. The picture quality (some angles) and sound is great. But a major drawback of the qled tech is that in some viewing angles the colors are little washed out.\nIf you are not worried about keeping up with the latest tech, I do believe that LED or OLED should be good enough which are at much cheaper prices with better viewing angles.",
            "Detailed review after 6 months use (only Ott content as I do not use standard tv connection)\n\nThe best TV in the price segment. Picture quality is unmatched. Clear and evident difference in the quality between Mi LED and QLed. This has very deep blacks and high crisp picture. Please note you will be able to enjoy the benefits only on Ott platforms and not on standard set top box. If u use majority of set top box then go for regular led instead of QLed.\n\nPros:\n1. Picture quality undoubtedly.. it recognises Dolby vision content from Netflix and hotstar, HDR10+ separately from prime and plays them perfectly.\n2. Sound is also adequately loud enough. I use soundboard which also can connect Dolby Atmos using eArc which is very rare at this price point.\n3. Apps, it has play store so has access to almost all the apps.\n4. The frame of this tv is so classy and almost looks like Basel less display. Super rich look.\n5. High connectivity options and futuristic.\n\nCons:\nNothing major till now. Initially had very bad picture quality while watching Dolby vision content, it showed patches all over but later rectified through software update. Now perfect.\n\nThis is the best see this price point, but can enjoy the picture quality benefits only on Ott apps. If you are av standard stb used them don't waste additional money on this.",
            "It's not like those samsung high quality QLED's but the panel in it does a great job. If you have the budget for that samsung QLED GOT FOR IT , , otherwise you this is a great tv itself In this budget .\nSound system in it is REALLY HIGH QUALITY, I NEVER DID IT TO 100",
            "As compared to the other of Sonu and samsung this is perfect LED value for money but sound is good but we can use additional speakers 4 better result\n\nThen also it will be cheaper compare to other",
            "PRO's:\n\n1. value for money\n2. excellent picture quality\n3. very good design and build quality\n\nCON's:\n1. sound quality is not good sometimes. even after maxing the volume, audio is not clear\n2. a USB port is not working sometimes (should be a fault with my specific piece)\n3. unable to change the picture mode to sport, movie directly while watching prime video or youtube. we have to exit the application and go to settings to change it. Whereas the options is available under the video while watching offline videos\n4. slight lag on times while watching a 4k UHD video offline (via HDD / Pen-drive)\n2. slow startup. takes almost 60secs to start the TV\n3. a dedicated app like onePlus connect to search in TV would be really helpful",
            "Memory used in the TV is always greater than 60-70%. This means that out of 2gb ram, approx 1.5gb is occupied by system which is a lot. RAM management should be better in the TV. Because of less user available RAM, switching between apps feels like a lag. Also the remote buttons make too much noise while pressing. MI should have provided soft button remote. Sound and picture quality is good but if you're looking for a smooth user experience then there are a lot of options out there in the market. Also, for MI there is a lot of room for improvement in this TV such as better RAM management which I hope will be pushed in a later update by Mi.",

            "There was delay in tv installation by the Flipkart. I then got it installed by MI service people. Their service and approach was good.\nI am using the tv now for 3 months and following is the review.\n1. Android opareting system: The android operating system of tv is very slow in response. This makes moving from one menu to another sluggish, it not responsive as compared to Sony or Samsung. Mi needs to immediately look into this and must come up with an upgrade.\n2. Remote : The remote is very minimalist and badly located buttons especially the mic button, one can switch off the tv when trying to press mic button. All other buttons requires effort to navigate the tv menu. Tv poor response and remote gives you very poor experience in operating the tv.\n3. Voice assistance : The audio command function is buggy, tv picks up it own sound and start listening and start other menus based on what it has picked of its own. You would find in middle of a program tv suddenly stops and start listening and opens some other menu. A serious bug in tv , which needs to be fixed immediately.\n4. Audio out function: The audio output level in digital pass through and pcm is so low that it is barely audible over a 200 w sound external system. One is forced to use digital Dolby out setting. Hence tv tries to convert stereo or all signal to 5.1 forcefully and does a very poor job. Auto level control for audio is also missing. Hence you would find tv sound vary between one channel to another. Hence an experienced audio listener with home theatre would not get good sound from tv as required. TVs own audio system is basic, you can not get better sound with such a thin profile of tv.\n5. Operating manual: They do not have an operating manual for tv, MI india thinks that Indian customers are stupid and dump hence there is no need to supply an operating manual, they will just switch the tv on and watch, they do not understand other features of tv hence why waste money in giving them an operating manual. A 2 page leaflet comes with tv which is basically is installation guide.\n\nAll the above issues have been pointed to MI call centre more than 2 months ago but nothing has done by Mi to fix these problems. Probably by not attending the issue it self solves the problem because customers eventually lives with problem.\nWith all the above issues the tv rating does not goes beyond 1 star.",

            "I bought this tv reading all the reviews and on the name of QLED however disappointed. I could see patches or decoluring on the face clearly for medium light shooting which makes it awful.\n\nCast to tv makes it difficult to cast unlike standalone Chromecast. Also it was hanged couple of times and had to power off from board.\n\nSound quality seems inferior. Given 30W I would expected it to be better.\nMy point if you are only looking 55 inch 4k better to go with ~15 k less unit than this tv. Or go for Samsung or Sony for more price.",

Remote is just ok, fire TV stick remotes are far better.",
            "Pros -\n- Amazing display (better than some 4k UHD TVs out there)\n- Awesome Sound (you will never need a soundbar)\n- Premium design\n\nCons -\n- Lagging UI (not a deal breaker)\n- Sudden drop in FPS in some pictures aka motion blur (once noticed, hard to ignore)\n\nGo for Sony any day even though the screen size is small or the TV is old.\nIf you don't have a budget for Sony, go for this QLED. Worth every penny.",
            "Positives:\n\n1) Content looks great.\n\n2) Software is excellent.\n\n3) Sound from TV speakers is loud as well as good enough, but not as good as dedicated speakers of home theater.\n\n4) Remote could have been better.\n\nNegatives:\n1) 1 negative point is, installation guy said that he is unable to connect my sound system with the TV using as it is not supporting Aux :/\nBut I used to connect my previous LG TV to sound system in the same way.\n\n2) Screen cast is very laggy.\n\n3) Not detecting when I connect my mobile for file transfer.\n\n4) There's no batteries for remote and wall mount is not included in the box, installation guy charged 499 for standard wall mount.\nAlso its better to let installation technician do installation has it has something to do with warranty.\n\n5) Peak Brightness could be negative if outside lighting is not controlled. Not a problem otherwise.\n\nAbout the delivery and installation:\n\n1) Delivery was fast but open box delivery was not performed.\n\n2) Only positive experience with installation was that it happened the very next day to delivery.\n\n3) Installation process was worst.\nAfter coming to my place, the installation guy told he will charge me 250 for removing my old TV and that these are company charges. So I tried calling Mi customer care and then he immediately said he can do it free of cost.\n\nHe was unprofessional. Threw(not gently) stuff on ground and on table, Stepped on TV box!(TV was not present inside though) , Put sharp instruments like drilling machine on sofa etc.\nI was afraid that he is going to break the TV with this attitude!\nI guess after installation they have to take a selfie with the TV with a sanitizer in hand, but he did not bring his sanitizer, so took mine and returned after taking selfie with it in hand.\n\nSo negative stars for installation and delivery.",
