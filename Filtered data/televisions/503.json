            "Hello everyone...\nI was planning to buy this TV from last 4-6 months but I was confuse between Offline & Online purchase due to Price difference and risk factor of online purchase.\nAfter lots of thinking finally ordered this LH LH576T on flipkart with BIG DISCOUNT of Rs.8000 as compare to offline dealer. At the time of placing my order flipkart assured me for delivery on 7th April.\nOn 7th april my order tracking status was showing reached at delivery destination. I was waiting for delivery person's call but no one contacted me till 4pm. I was visited ekart office near to my home just on walking distance. The person who was on chair behind the computer was playing game on his phone, I told him about my order but he ignored.... after 2 times of repetition he said TV and other big products dose not delivered by us and we dont have any contact details or address of other delivery partner. till now everything was okay.... but when I contacted tollfree number of delivery partner \"GATI TRANSPORT\" they said it may take 24 to 48 hrs to deliver your product. I said it is allready running late and why you need 48 hrs to deliver my product when it is reached in my location?? Can I cancell the order?? he said sir it is your order and you can do anything we will not deliver this product b4 48 hrs due to other orders are pending for delivery. after that I contacted to flipkart social media CC the called me back in few min and discussed my issue. and after that within 10 min GATI person called me and assured me for instant delivery at my place on 9th April (2 days late).\n\nNow come to the product and Installation\n\nInstallation :\nOn monday morning I received SMS from Jeeves for my installation and demo appointment booking.\nEngineer called me on 5:30 PM and within 15 min reached at my home.\nWithing 15 min he done his teble top installation process.\nHe was unable to answer my technical questions due to lac of knowledge.\nInstallation & wall mount was totally free.\n\nAbout TV\nI m using this TV from last 4-5 days and Im Impressed with the sound & Picture quality.\nIf you have unlimited hi speed data access then YouTube experience will be superb.\nUniversal remote function is missing.\n1TB external HDD working fine with USB connectivity.\nOverall it is fantastic product at this price.\n\nNOTE : I GAVE THIS PRODUCT ONLY 1 STAR JUST BECAUSE OF THE #rd CLASS DELIVERY BY GATI.\nI WILL NEVER BUY ANY BIG SIZE PRODUCT FROM FLIPKART IF DELIVERY PARTNER WILL BE GATI.",
            "I am writing the review after using it for 10 days. I ordered it on 20th sep during Big Billion Day sale at an amazing price of Rs. 35732 (35499+233 for 2 years extended warranty from Jeeves). Received it on 21st sep. As always Flipkart rocks in delivery. Packing was also perfect. I got a call from LG regarding installation on 21st itself and it was installed at my home on 22 sep. As expected TV box does not contain Magic remote. The guy brought with him the swivel type wall mounting kit and everything was free of cost. Now the Pros and Cons-\n\nPros-\nPicture quality is very Good.\nSound quality is also very good. While playing Youtube volume level at 20 out of 100 is sufficient.\nPlays all common video formats like .mp4, .avi, .mkv etc.\nConnects to Wifi without any problem.\nScreen share or Miracast is also working perfectly.\nYoutube takes around 2-3 sec to start a video but then plays it without any buffering . I have 3 mbps broadband at home.\nHDMI and USB ports are working fine. I have connected 1 TB hard drive and tested. Only USB and one HDMi located at side and one HDMI at back.\n\nCons-\nTV does not come with a magic remote.\nIt does not support wireless Keyboard or mouse. (A big disappointment)\nIt does not support LG TV Plus app. If it had, We could use our mobile as magic remote.\nOnly one USB port.\nDoes not have a web browser.\n\nFinal verdict- If you don't use smart features a lot, then this TV is perfect at this amazing price. This is a semi-smart TV with basic features only. If you need all smart features you can go for the next higher model i.e. LG 43LJ554T. It supports all smart features though it does not have a magic remote. In my case I am happy with the TV except that it should have supported wireless keyboard and mouse. That is why I have reduced one star.",

It has 2 hdmi inputs,one with ARC, works fine. Miracast works fine, I connected my lenovo A7000 phone with my tv without any issues. The external usb is working fine, but it cannot play most of the file formats.

The installation was fabulous .\n4th Nov. 7pm I got the tv. Next day 9am I got call from jeeves saying confirming and asking about the time acc to my choice . The wall mount was also free which is a plus point but due to some reasons I didn't preferred the wall mount option .\n\nNow coming to the product\n\nAs I am not an expert . These are just my revehw\n\n- TV is super big and looks very premium . With its stand/ supports it looks gorgeous.\n- Audio quality is simply great. Even only on 25% vol. My whole Hall was like a disco and the sound is pretty clear too. You won't get a bass like effect but it doesn't matter atleast to me\n- TV turn on time is 3-4 sec max.\n- Screen Casting works flawlessly and I enjoyed it the most.\n- Youtube is also pretty awesome and the quality on the videos was simply amazing .\n- It was a life like experience watching 1080p videos on TV . So the picture quality is also a plus point.\n- Can't find an issue till now . I am enjoying it....\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd I got it for 36k.\nSo no regrets\n.",

            "After 2 months of usage I am able to give my honest opinion on this product.\nThe only reason i have deducted one star is because flipkart charged me Rs. 1200 for the wall mount even though they had explicitly mentioned a free wall mount in an advertisement.\n\nPROS:\n- Great picture quality. Even low quality videos look great. Looks stunning with HD channels.\n- Sound quality is very good and there is absolutely no need for any kind of speaker.\n- Smart apps work fine (though I don't have much use for them).\n- Screen mirroring works nicely.\n- USB playback is smooth and lag free and can play all common formats.\n- At 32K it was a steal!\n\nCONS:\n- You cannot play 10 bit videos through usb (WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME) so many of my high quality shows don't work.\n- LG App Store is extremely limited. Only 2-3 apps are relevant , others are useless.\n- Absence of even a simple browser.\n- Difficult to access media servers or other streaming methods.\n- Has only one usb port.\n\nThe TV is definitely worth buying if you do not require any browser etc and just need a basic smart tv.\nThe quality is remarkable and the price is quite justified.\nI would recommend people to buy this.",
            "After using the TV for about a week, I noticed that it had a bad case of Image Retention. Image Retention a.k.a. Image Sticking/Ghosting happens when an image gets imprinted on screen after being displayed for a long period. Image Retention can become an issue if it becomes permanent (Image Burn-in). I had a 40\" Samsung LED TV before this and never faced this problem with it (that TV also had big issues, but that's a tale for some other time). I told Flipkart about my predicament, and they immediately processed a replacement that I received the very next day. However, it's been 2 days since I received it and I'm still waiting for the installation to be done. I will update this review after testing the replacement TV.\nUpdate: After using the replacement TV for 3 months I am fairly satisfied with the product. I did some research online and found that certain LED TVs have retention issue if used as a monitor. Unfortunately, I am using this as a PC Home Theatre. Fortunately, I also found a solution for my problem. I have kept the screensaver on, so if the PC is unused for a few minutes it automatically starts; preventing the retention issue. Like many have already pointed out here that it is not a proper smart TV as it is missing many features, so do your research before buying it. The clarity is good. The picture setting has a lot of options to customise the display to your liking. I personally prefer the \"Game\" mode with \"High\" noise reduction. Changing my rating to 3 Stars.",
            "The LG smart TV is not so smart, actually. Although its been branded as a SMART TV it comes with pre-loaded apps most of which are of no use or are games. It does not have a BROWSER which according to me is a big minus. I have a LG 32 in smart tv of years old which has browser. This marketing of smartness but fooling buyers into buying a cheap or discounted smart tv is misleading. IT should clearly be told that it does not support browser nor a smart remote. You feel really stuck when u r typing on youtube.\n\nOverall quality of product is good as I already have LG 32 in smart tv. But if its misleading people then its not good but cheating. another model of LG which costs 10,000 more had browser support.",
            "We loved the product.. particularly the smart TV options and video eye comfort along with audio std.typeII... 43inch best fit for our living room and the clarity of tv is awesome..oveerall experience with flipkart is good and very well managed to deliver the product on time.",
            "Pros\n\n- Excellent picture quality\n- Excellent sound quality bo need if external speakers\n- one HDMI and USB port at side\n- Total of 2 HDMi\n- Looks good when wall mounted\n- Free wall mount flexi stand and installation by Flipkart partner team\n- Wifi works fine no lags at all while casting screen\n- 1 TB HDD tried and works very well\n- laptop files n folders can be used by sharing folder in public video folder on windows\n\nCons\n- For smart features Location does not support US location, so very very limited apps which can be used in smart features\n- No web browser, so no web surfing, in smart features due to very limited apps we only end up using YouTube and Netflix for all others we need to use our Mobiles and cast screen on TV\n- Android mobile remote not support, tried several apps but none of them work with this TV model, so no option but to use the remote which came with TV\n- Magic remote not supported even using Abdroid mobile remote\n- Remote is not universal\n-No other option to cast laptops screen as my laptop was not supporting WIDI",
            "Nice product at nice price but, installation and demo was pathetic. Flipkart does it by themselves not by LG and the technician what they send for demo and installation are just good enough to make drills and hang your TV and if ur TV is smart ,then are dead smart too explain even the simplest info, forget the complicated features",
            "Excellent TV !!!!!!\nAbsolute awesomeness !!!!!\nWell to start with the delivery was delayed by a day so I am retaining the last star or else it wud have definitely been full on full...I understand it was the big billion but u know u got to keep up the expectations...\nThe TV is evryting from b to y in the word \" Beauty \" it looks stunning and I don't have more words sorry :-D\nThe brochure says it's only Full HD but trust me it's almost like Ultra HD 4k. I mean u definitely will not notice the difference.\nVery sleek n very purposeful.\nHas built-in YouTube and he'll it can even stream videos from your phone without the need for chrome cast :-D\nAm completely in love with it and definitely suggest it for others ;-)",
