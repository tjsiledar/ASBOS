            "HD and 4K videos are displayed excellent and good surround sound. Comes with Android 11 and Google assistant works well.\n\nOn-time delivery and Installation and demo by Flipkart team.\n\nHighly recommend other to purchase Nokia TV who are providing excellent hardware specs with latest software.",
            "Truly a real good tv after 10 days of usage. Sound quality nd picture quality are top notch. Much better experience compared to MI 5X, the nokia sound by onkyo version is real good (well you do have to configure the sound profile). Best thing you can change the audio settings while you are watch something and it won't go to settings page rather it will let you change settings in the overlay itself. Only samsung has such seamlessness other than nokia. Glad i purchased this. Watching through browser on websites is easy too.\n\nThe only con is that Rakuten Viki app doesn't support Nokia TV (if you are into korean series and movies you will know).",

            "Features are good specially sound.\nIt has slow connectivity. It can't reach Wifi as fast as one plus or other TVs.\nOverall good experience and good picture and sound quality if you want to watch normal HD channels.",
            "Excellent TV by Nokia. Went ahead going through all reviews and hardly found any review that would want me to rethink purchasing the Nokia 50 inch. Simply an awesome product at a reasonable price.",
            "I have to say 'I am impressed'. With this price it is giving tough competition to brands like OnePlus, MI, LG, Samsung, etc. and almost beating them in one or the other aspect.\nPicture quality: Very bright, Good contrast, Sharp. Negetive: It's VA panel so color start to Detroit if viewing from a certain angle.\nSound quality: totally impressed, the bass it produces when Dolby Atmos is ON, it's awesome. No negetive\nConnectivity: no issues so far, just when I was setting it up for first time, I...\nREAD MORE",

            "Extremely bad viewing angles and flipkart will not admit this and seller will tell you that this is not in the return policy as if you watch any thing from the centre of the tv then only you can enjoy the colors of the tv otherwise from left or right view your colors get fade away. And customer will get sick attending technicians",

I personally don't feel need to purchase any extra soundbar.\nScreen is really crisp and saturated.\nRemote has many useful shortcuts\nAndroid TV OS, so latest features from Google\n\nCons\nSlow. One thing I noticed with budget TVs are that they use very cheap and entry level processors, which make the UX very slow. And this is something one has to live with. Sometimes apps will take ages to load. I don't use DTH, I mostly use multiple OTTs. So whenever I wanted to go watch TV, I first log into Netflix or Prime Video in my PC, browse what I would like to see, and then head over to the TV.",

Its really good.Picture and connectivity seems decent as well.\n\nThings I don't are mainly the booting time which is a lot compared with my previous TV after switching the power on.Secondly when it does software update, it gives some kind of fully grains thing which I never seen in any device.Seriously i thought the updates made some kind of fault in my system earlier, but wasnt the case.Overall its good purchase",
