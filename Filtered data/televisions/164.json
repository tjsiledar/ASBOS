            "One of the best TV in the UHD 4K segment. Can enjoy Visuals in crystal clear display. Value for money.",
            "This is a review after 2 days of use. TV was properly delivered in fair time even in this uncertain period and installation by a Samsung technician was done right next day of delivery. This is my second 55inch smart TV at my home and first Samsung. I explored almost all functionalities of the TV and I have reset the TV to factory settings once. Below are my findings.\nPositive:\n1. Price\n2. Looks very beautiful. Almost frameless.\n3. I had a major doubt when purchasing the TV about it's remote control. And yes, it's a smart remote and has voice control and hot keys. It's connected with Bluetooth and you can control TV from anywhere even if you don't have line of sight. Looks very elegant and is very easy to use.\n4. Initial setting up of TV is very simple using Samsung Smart Things app in your phone. Though it's a bit complicated to use the app after setting up is done.\n5. Best thing about this TV is that, TV remote automatically detects and syncs the functionalities of your set top box. That is, I use d2h and I don't need a remote separately to change channels or such, as TV remote is functional now with STB. This is an awesome feature.\n6. As this is a Samsung TV there is no need to mention about picture quality.\n7. While I was buying this TV I was also thinking about buying a 160W creative sound bar. But the TV has awesome sound output. You get decent bass also. Only if you are a hard core sound fan, you would require a sound bar. Else, sound is decent.\n\nNegative\n1. You need to go deep inside the rear side of TV to reach connectivity ports like USB port. I have barely 5cm left in the sides of TV and hence it's impossible to plug in and out a USBs. I have attached a male-female cable on TV permanently.\n2. I don't know if this will be negative for many people, may be because of the high refresh rate, you don't get the feel of watching a movie, rather u feels like watching a serial. That is be it in DTH, USB or OTT, movies feels like serial or a usual video. Though there is no problem at all in this, I felt this a bit different as there is a typical look for pictures of movies, you don't get that here.\n\nSumming up, this is the best TV you get at this price I am guessing. Looks, sound, remote and picture quality being the best things in this TV.\nGood luck for your purchase.",

            "Tv was delivered on time. Samsung guy came and installed within 2 hours of delivery. He didnt know much about smart features so it was a quick installation. He came with free wall mount stand. Polite guy.\nConnectivity is good. it is easy to connect with WIFI and bluetooth devices.

Upscaling could have been better.\nSound at 20W is not that loud but it is clear. Dialogues are not loud while playing movies.\nDesign of TV is great, and Remote is classy.\nVery few apps are available in app store.\nTizen OS is superfast, TV takes 5 sec for on and off.\nOverall value for money and a pocket friendly 4K smart TV.

            "As always Flipkart beat my expectations. Any big appliance Flipkart is the place to come.\n\nPurchase and Delivery - 5/5 - Prompt delivery and kept me up to date with timely messages. Delivery on time and no hassles in exchange of the old TV.\n\nPicture quality is true Samsung level high bench mark for the price you pay. I checked few other low cost brands but decided to pay slightly higher premium for the Samsung. But it is worth.\n\nInstallation is very smooth - Samsung technician provided wall mount (free) and explained features very well. Arrived for installation within 24 hours of delivery.\n\nWill update more after I explore features. It has way too many connectivity features. Bix by works like charm. Need to explore further.\n\nOverall very impressed. At this price (can't believe 8 series TV at this price) it is surely a winner in hand for Samsung.",
            "First I\u2019d like to clarify on the doubt whether it is a series 6 or series 8 smart tv. This is a series 8 smart tv , The series 6 in comparison has different specs and overall dimensions.\n\nPros(+)\nDesign, its almost bezel less.\nDisplay is bright, vivid and blacks are blacks!\nSound quality is good on what you expect from a built in speaker\nOptions for Airplay and google assistant(through update waited from Samsung)\nQuick boot up and smart remote is good one\nand with smart things app you can do wonders!!!\n\nCons(+)\nAuto motion plus -Where the tv pushes the 30fps content to higher FPS. This is not 100% accurate from Samsung. There many instances it has a judders.\nTip:( Turn it off in picture settings to enjoy the movie as it was shot to enjoy as 30fps,60fps makes your movie like it is short in a camcorder)\n\nTizen OS is not smooth as android and offers less apps.\n\n\nOverall it is a good buy. I trust Samsung for their displays as they are the best in industry. Go for it if you\u2019re brand conscious and quality is your front runner!",
            "Within 2days of order the TV is delivered and installed. For now the picture quality is great as this TV has a Samsung pqi index of 2100. Will update after a week.\n\nUpdate nearly 2 months of use. The picture quality was awesome at this price range and may compete with higher price range also. I bought the 43 inch and HD channels of my d2h looks sharp and pristine. The SD channels also good in this TV. You won,t regret while buying this TV if you looks for picture quality.",
            "Good picture quality..and also the sound is good.It have wifi 5ghz channel and also i dont find any connectivity issue on this tv.The remote looks classy and also you can operate from samsung smart things app.so overall i have satisfied with my purchase.",
            "Picture clarity is good, sound is not that much great it's ok for normal room, connectivity is good, some times remote not working properly and hangs for 3secs, only limited apps are available in samsung app store, delivery and installation as on time and happy with that, installation person will bring free wall mount stand which is not included in tv box",
            "Delivered on time by Flipkart as expected. Installation done very next day by Samsung engineer. Picture quality is awesome. Like the remote control it's not like traditional one and easy to use. My recommendation is go for it without any doubt.",
            "So this TV was delievered to me within 3 days. And was installed by samsung within the next day. So here are reviews after 2 days of usage.\n\nThe TV has quite good video quality. Not as good as compared to OLED screens. But it is quite good in this price range.\n\n4K is really good\n. As this is my first LED tv, I was quite confused that why is the picture moving so fast in 4K and considered it as an issue with tv. After further research, I came to know that the frames in a 4K video is almost doubled. Hence the pictures moves fast and gives a smooth experience.\n\nComing to UHD videos, today only I watched The Dark Knight on this TV, and I was amazed too see those small details in the movie which I never saw before ( I have watched this movie earlier on laptop and tablet). To be more precise, The suit of the Batman Was showing every minute detail, the explosion scene was looking so realistic and it goes on.\n\nThe speakers are decent with quality Bass and sound. You go ahead and listen to all ur EDM songs and feel the beat. Its quite enough for a normal person.",
            "Amazing picture quality. Decent sound. Best in this price range. Super quick delivery and installation",
            "I thought of giving a complete review of this product, that's why I have used the TV for a full month before posting the review, This is going to be a long paragraph so please bare with me :)\n\nIn this review I am going to start with the packaging and delivery and then will move the product's pros and cons.\n\nI have booked this TV on end of November 2020 and received the TV in a couple of days, a big thumps up for Flipkart for that, the delivery was good and the packaging was beautiful and I w...\nREAD MORE",
            "Bang on the money... This was Flipkart exclusive ... Great pic quality... Delivery and installation was timely... I choose the no cost emi option and also received the icici cash back... All in all it made up for all the lockdown and stay at home sickness... Tech smart and tech worthy ...it's samsung and Flipkart ki jodi...",
            "Great tv at this range ..great picture quality.bixby and alexa voice assistant easy 2 use.overall at this price its a great buy.\ud83d\ude42.thank u flipkart 4 the timely delivery and great installation service.if u opt 4 tizen os.go 4 this u will not b disappointed.",
            "Excellent product at this price. Stunning picture quality and doubly atoms sound really impressive and no need of external speakers or home theatre. Coming to connectivity with apps seeing lag, but that\u2019s ok. You don\u2019t feel it. Overall fully satisfied with the product.",
            "This is the initial review which I am giving now,\n\nPros:\n\n1. Firstly, Samsung is one of the best brands like Sony, LG.\n2. Well, it has best customer support.\n3. Picture quality is really crystal and cool. (4.7/5)\n3. Sound quality is good.(4.5/5)\n4. Supports Major apps like Hotstar, Netflix, prime, zee etc with limited app store.(4.4/5)\n5. Performance is okay with respect to this TV (4.5/5) feature.\n6. This TV is getting at affordable price when compared to another e-commerce apps.(4.8/5)\n\nCons:\n\n1. It is not android basically, comes with Tizen os specific to Samsung only. It's better if Samsung comes with android since it's popular these days.\n2. Tizen OS is pretty little slow when compared to Android OS. But overall it's having good performance.\n3. Apps store is limited but it's is fine with 4GB ROM and expecting in future releases.\n4. No wall mount is provided as part of packing need to buy externally or needs to get it from the installation team only.\n5. Nowadays, delivery people are expecting tip for delivery.\n6. It's better Flipkart needs to give the country of origin on the products furtherly.\n\n\nI will try to review again once I use it for at least some more days..",
            "Total Value for Money.\n\nI chose it over LG because of:\n1. All in one lovely Remote, no hunting for LG magic remotes.\n2. Display quality\n3. Best option in this price for Mirroring your Apple MacBook and work seamlessly like you've got a true monitor. :)\nPlay a movie on your laptop web browser / Player, it mirrors so fluently like you never see the lag.\n\nChinese brands are completely useless; better opt for a 32inch LG/Samsung if you're running low on budget instead of a quick fun of few months and regretting later on.\nOR buy a non-smart 43/40 inch option from Sony/Samsung/LG and add on the smartness of fire stick.\n\nTizen OS is blazing fast but can be made more customizable.",
            "This is an amazing TV with advance technology built by samsung, I love it's performance over all. The seller did an outstanding job by delivering the product with in one day time frame and I got it installed and demo by samsung on the same day, that is awesome. I strongly recommend that this is worth money deal.",
            "I received the product on the exact date given by flipkart. The next date samsung executives came for installation. He was in a tearing hurry and did not explain much of the functionalities. Now after having gone through each and every aspect myself, following is the verdict. It is a very nice TV. Picture quality is good for the price. However do not expect the best. Sound quality is average. Wifi connectivity is good. It also connects to the PC and laptop without hassles. However when I connected it to my sony speakers, the bluetooth connectivity was irregular. Overall a good TV at this price. However if you have experienced OLED and QLED tv viewing, picture quality would look average but compared to other normal LED tvs even FHD ones it is awesome.",
            "Just wow TV. Edited after 9months use.\nPros:\nPicture quality is fantastic. 2160p (4k) videos are fabulous.\n1080p videos also gives stunning result.\nBazzleless body looks stunning.\nBluetooth connectivity is also good. When you on your bluetooth device TV will show you pop up to connect, which is very good feature.\nSmart remote is easy to use.\nWifi (read cons also) connectivity is good enough.\nIt's amazing to watch my DSLR photos & videos on screen.\n\nCons:\nRemote buttons are too sensitive, easily operates accidentally and switches apps and again loading to that same app u r watching is hactic.\nNo MX Player app, Tizen has very less application.\nXender/Share it app not available in TIZEN.\nWifi connectivity good via phone hotspot.\nOther Android TVs are able to Connect to wifi router via network provider's log in page but in TIZEN OS i cant go to login page of wifi network provider.\nWifi & bluetooth button on Smart Remote should be provided or home shortcut to give.\nVoice search is ridiculous, very bad.\nPicture Ambient mode is not as expected. You have to upload your photos to Samsung cloud for this feature.",
            "This TV is very good in this range. I am using this TV for last 3 to 4 months but I haven't face any problem. There are some minor issues. The image quality of this tv is really good. And sound quality is decent low but good. This is a 4k TV. There are some of the features that I like the most i.e. Remote PC, Office 365, Screen mirroring and many mores. There are many apps available in this TV as example like you to Netflix, Prime video, Hotstar, sonyliv, Samsung internet, Samsung gallery, YouTube, alt Balaji, Aaj Tak, and many more app are available in this TV. There are three types of Assistant as like Google Assistant, Alexa, Bixby you can use any of the assistant as per your requirement.\nREMOTE PC\n\u2022 NOTE:- First you have to open the PC or laptop and connect with a network and if your PC is at your office and it is connected with network then you can use this feature very easily.\nOFFICE 365\nYou can use Microsoft PowerPoint, Word, OneNote, Access and many more apps is available in this feature.\nSCREEN MIRRORING\nYou can connect the PC screen on the Samsung TV by using this feature.\nSAMSUNG DEX\nBy using this feature you can view the screen of your mobile.",
            "Writting this review after 1 month of usage of the 43 inch model.\n\nFirstly the TV was delivered exactly on the schedule date and time. The installation was also done on the given date but due to Sunday the tv was installed on Monday.\nThe Table top stand was included in the box. Wall mount kit was brought by the installation person.\n\nComing to the TV,\n\nPROS.\n\nThe display quality is very good . Sharpness and colour are on point as it's a samsung display.\n\nThe display is edge to edge but there is a short black border on its all sides.\n\nThe design feels very premium. Very impressed with design.\n\nThe remote is bluetooth enabled. The response time is quick enough.\n\nThe best thing is that TV doesn't take too much time to boot up.\n\nThe cable connection or Set Top Box works very nicely.\nI have to upgrade to hd plan for a better viewing quality.\n\nThe OS is also good and responsive.\n\nWorks fine with a decent bluetooth earphone or headset.\nHeadphone jack is missing so you have to buy a dongle or a blue sound system.\n\nWifi Connectivity is also decent.\n\nThe processor is also good enough considering the price of this tv at 40k. Streams a 4k video properly on YouTube if the wifi connection is good.\n\nScreen mirroring works very much smooth.\n\nCONS.\n\nThe display is good and sharper but sometimes the brightness feels a bit low.\n\nIt's my first samsung smart tv so I was having not much of idea about the OS. The OS is good but also disappointing a lot. At time of buying I was checking specs and found out that the storage was not mentioned at all and here comes the issue that you can't install any third party apps in this TV. The apps which are available in its store only that are accessible.\n\nThe apps on the store are very much limited means sometimes I can literally remember 70% of the apps.\n\nIf you are playing any video via pendrive or harddrive there is only one default video player which I personally didn't like. You can't change the language of the movie. There are very limited video player setting.\n\nIf you use OTT apps then there is no option for downloading or saving offline.\n\nNow starts the most disappointing things of this TV.\nFirstly if you are a sound lover, just skip this tv series, go for samsung frame or serif series or connect a sound system. If you are streaming a video or movie the vocals are not heard properly I was seating 5-6 feets close then to at 70% volume I found it difficult to hear and the base goes suddenly too much high you have to constantly increase and decrease the volume. I suggest you to go with a sound bar. Very disappointed with sound.\n\nThe second disappointment was the OS setting, there are a number of features given in settings but hardly 40-50% of them are accessible. If we can't use it then why have the company given it\n\nCONCLUSION.\nFor a normal user this TV is more than enough. If talking about speaker it's only good for a 10 by 10 room, for a bigger room you need sound system. And for the installing third party apps just buy a firestick or best is MI box 4k.\n\nFor first time TV buyers I recommend this TV, only to those who want 43 inch at price if 35-40k.\n\nIf you want to buy 50 inch or 55 inch which are cost 45k to 50k, then I would recommend you to go for OnePlus tv which cost 50k for 55 inch.\n\nDon't go for the 65inch variant of this tv, instead add a few money in it and go for the frame series or the serif series or QLED series which are from samsung. They are a much better deal and you will be totally satisfied with it.\nThank me latter..",

Amazingly smart remote control... very slim and handy.Nicely working as of now. I am writing this review after two week's of purchase.\n\nFlipcart delivery was lightning fast.\n\nSamsung service dept. responded in a couple of days. But the service rendered was very pathetic. The installer Mr. Santhosh from Samsung Service Centre, Salem brought a wall mount for the TV. It was to be fixed using four screws. While doing the work, one screw broke down and detached from the mount frame. He declared it as sufficient and the the TV is still hanging on three screws. He seemed to be very busy and hence not interested to explain or demonstrate even the main features of the TV. He even misguided us regarding the internet connectivity issues telling that the device required broadband connection and high speed mobile net won't serve the purpose.\n\nBecause of poor service, I'm restrained to give 3 Star rating. I hope that Samsung will concentrate on providing better quality service in future.",

            "The voice of this TV is a little bit less",
            "DELIVERY\nTV is very good. Delivery was on time. Samsung representative also installed it on time. I use it for my computer. I dont use the built-in assistant or the apps. Here is my assessment of the TV.\nTV\nVisuals are good. The brightness is also decent. Screen size is good. But the glass top is not anti glare. It is reflective, makes watching the screen at day time a bit strenuous. Bezels are disappointing. Even though the website says 3 side thin bezels, that is not the case. They are actually inside and behind the glass front. It looks thin only when the TV is off.\nDISPLAY\nHDR is supported. But this also decreases the brightness suddenly and significantly. A manual tuning is required and it is a task to do. A direct ALL SETTINGS button on the remote would be appreciated in this case. Sharpness is a bit of disappointment as you need to set it at least two third way up for it to actually make visual impact.\nCONNECTIVITY\nThere are really good connectivity options. 2 HDMI + 1 HDMI with eARC (audio return channel). Composite, optical out, Bluetooth for speakers, wifi fot internet and screen mirror, ethernet port. 2 USB 2.0, and RF. More USB ports would be appreciated for those who use LED lights behind their screen for powering them.\nFEATURES\nIt has tons of features like adaptive sound, ambience mode, game mode, and also provides storage. The Ambience Mode is superb as the TV can be used as a photo frame to display all of your favourite pics. Also the Music mode is really useful when you are cleaning your house or room or just having a party with friends you need not invest in a music player, as the TV really gives great options for tuning.\nDESIGN\nThe design is beautiful. It looks sleek. It has enough space under the TV for set top boxes or a decent size sound bar even when you use the stands provided instead of mounting it. However the engineering on the TV is not flawless. It gets overheated soon. Touch the back of the TV on the top side after an hour or two. The power and connection ports are far apart making cable management a bit hard.\nREMOTE\nRemote is good but the assistant can only be used through the remote. There is no dedicated ALL SETTINGS button which means you always need to navigate to the settings for tuning the display. Atleast a quick button on the remote for picture and sound expert settings would be useful.\nPOWER SAVINGS\nPower saving wise it is not that great. There is an Eco mode but it is not that great. There are no fine tuning options and you have to rely on the preset options. Wifi is always on, cannot be shut down. All the Eco Mode does is adjust the brightness settings. There is no fast display off if no signal input. All of them are set above 2 hours.\nEXPECTATIONS FROM SAMSUNG\nSince this is a smart TV, most of the above cons can be solved with a simple firmware update. However, the bezels, the top glass screen, the smart remote, the heating issues need to be re engineered for future customers with better design and engineering. Doing this will most definitely make it a top contender in its segment.",

Initially i was confused with MI and Nokia led tv, however after doing some R&D found out that all these LED panels have screen bleeding issue. So finally decided to give a run for the money in a trusted brand as Samsung. I am using this tv since 2 weeks now. Will give u my honest review on this.\nPros:\nTV got deilivered in 2 days and even installation+Demo has been done same day\nPicture quality is just amazing\nSound output of 20W is more than sufficient i feel\nWireless connectivity is just flawless\nScreen mirroring works with an ease\nUniversal remote is easy to operate\nAmbient mode is just amazing\nColour reproduction is just above my expectation\n\nCons:\nIf you have already mounted this tv and then want to plug in any USB or any HDMI cable, its a tough job trust me. Rather Samsung could have given a seperate box as same they provide with Samsung Frame.\n\nFinally i beleive that under 50k range this 55inch UHD TV is the best TV in market so far.",

The picture quality was making the difference btw the samsung and vu. Samsung screen seem to look much clearer and contrast levels were amazing. I bought it for mostly for watching movies, music and Series. The sound experience is good. But i would prefer a soundbar if you are a audiophile. I mostly play ut around 40 to 50perc voulume. Watching movies was most pleasant. Also in some dark movie scene it feels a bit laggy or blurry. The gaming performance is trash. If u are planning to play mobile games like asphalt. Dont imagine. It sometimes lag while browsing movies. Its multitasking capabilities not good. But being a TIZEN OS its fine. Unlike Android u stop getting updates af few years and it wont support apps. Just the backlight of the tv is not good. So watch it in a dark room. I use it in dark room for best picture quality.",

Display is very good and definitely better than Mi TV, VU, Real me etc. I believe display is the important feature of a TV and it will not disappoint in this aspect.\n2. Connectivity is fast, no issues whatsoever.\n3. Sound is enough for a TV, its loud and clear.\n4. Has popular OTT apps pre installed.\n5. Screen casing works pretty well with minimal lagging.\n6. Screen on and off is faster than other TV's like Mi TV, VU, Real me etc.\n7. UI is simple.\n\nCons:\n1. Tizen is good, but Android would have been better.\n2. Sometimes there is a lag in TV remote response. Not always.\n\nOpinion: As I believe that display is the prominent feature of a TV, the product has a great display quality and hence it is a great buy.",

They properly installed my tv and explained the features.",
            "Awesome picture quality",
            "Picture quality is good not good for a brighter room\nVery less number of apps in tizen operating system\nAudio quality is average",
            "It\u2019s just more than value for money.\nAwesome picture quality and smoothness.\nSound quality is also better not best I would say.",
            "Guys just go for it it's so fast and tizen os so it's boots in 2 seconds and YouTube prime video every thing Believe me U never Regret For android tv You can easily connect yours windows and Mac device and you can work via lappy & belive me it's samsung Iam not giving a Paid review Samsung service centre are all across India and there Doorstep service is excellent Don't think about tizen it's Samsung you never beat it's picture quality & premium ness in this range. Iam Reviewing this tv after 2 months Don't think it's high on price & tizen it's Samsung Not a Chinese brand.\nWorth every penny\ud83d\ude01",
            "Smart TV with excellent 4k picture quality. But disappointed as the packing box says Series 8 but the software says Series 6. This very type of distrust able marketing is not expected from a big brand like Samsung at All. All features are perfect but some features like Dolby Atmos is disabled. No of apps are limited and u cannot add new apps. If Samsung may highlight that how Android based apps can be installed in Tizen Os. The wall mount is very cheap and for high end smart TVs it should be movable and provided free of cost. So it's difficult when you attach a LAN or hdmi at the back. Samsung should have an app which can only stream 4K movies collection. Overall at this price it is a good buy. Flipkart delivery was excellent but the demo guys came after 48hrs with excuses which is a general routine for them.",
            "Best value for money excellect picture quality and speed",
            "Tv was soo smooth and good really loved it",
            "Samsung is the name ENOUGH.. Totally worth buying. \ud83e\udd70",
            "First week review super product",
            "Exilent product",
            "The product is very good. Just instead of providing fixed wall mount you should have provided flexible wall mount for the TV.",
            "Awesome video quality, value for money. Go for it..\ud83d\ude0a",
            "Overall nice tv. Technician did'nt give complete demo of tv features.",
            "Value for money",
            "All in one.picture quality is beyond the exception.this is first smart tv .happy to buy it.",
            "Excellent one..",
            "Sd to hd picture upscaling cud have been better.",
            "good product....best in this budget",
            "Excellent product by samsung and timely delivery by Flipkart and quick response regarding instalation.",
            "Quality is average for the price spent, better to buy other non branded tv's of the same features with less price. Remote stopped working after an year",
            "Received tv yesterday and very next day got installed by the Samsung guy ..very cooperative and friendly nice service by flipkart and Samsung which we will not get in cheap Chinese brands ...rest will update after watching it sometime...\nThanks for timely service..",
            "Picture quality is superb. But keeping at least 8 feet distance must. Audio is not loud but it is clear enough to hear and more over it depends upon the input too. Bluetooth connectivity works well so no need to worry audio any more.Every essentials like prime video, gana,Hotstar ,zee5, etc are there. Tizen\u2019s applications are very much limited but it is enough. But when we are greedy to experiment everything usually we do in the android think about it . When some files are not supported we would think about it but everything has a alternate too in today\u2019s world. Connecting lap top is very easy wirelessly (windows10) but I feel some lag while playing videos rarely not a big issue. One of the best thing is it\u2019s remote very simple and nice to hold. All necessary ports are there everything located right side when you stand before the tv . Reaching ports is difficult. One of the features available in this tv is ambient mode.voice search works. Browser available and Microsoft 365 available you can work online and save them on cloud(PC mode ?) overall it has all necessary things to satisfy a normal customer at this prize level"
