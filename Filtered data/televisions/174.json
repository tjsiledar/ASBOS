The product is very good till now what I have used i.e. connected Android with Ethernet as well as Wi-Fi and have also connected my Computer display to HDMI and is working very nicely for me.\nWatch for the service centers in your location specific for Acer TV; just in case of any issues in near future there should not be any problem as the Acer service center where the Laptops and other thing are accepted are not providing TV Support which is the only thing of concern but that is the case only when there is a problem with device.",

Display panel used is thrown away panels from QC checks in chaina. If you buy this TV your money is invested on wrong item , your eyes get strained and your eyesight will be lost in few days due to mismatched , blurry pictures.

It opens with apps selection page insted of opening where I left it before last power off. Looks like its still not fixed by any android TV brand.\n\nNo brightness control when app is opened. Like hotstar/Amazon prime.\n\nBecomes very hot. I can feel heat wave from the backvents of TV . This was warm in previous tv but in this one its hot. I have added a PC fan on the tv for pulling out hot air from the motherboard.\n\nSwitch off overscan from settings to get better experience.",
