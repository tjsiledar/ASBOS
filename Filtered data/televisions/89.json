            "Giving this review after two days of use. Very happy with the product, flipkart quick delivery and the installation. As per the promotional offer from hisense my 55\" tv will be under warranty of coming 5yrs. Hope there won't be any issues before and after. Initially I thought of using my Sony home theater for better audio, now I realized it don't need because of Dolby Atmos. Thank you Hisense and Flipkart.",
            "First of all thank you Flipkart,Second one is Hisense.\nNow review for my 43\u2019 led Tv. Some people say this product review wrong .But My opinion this one is awesome.Very fast connect .Picture quality is very nice 4K mode and HD both mode . Product is impressed for me and my family. Sound is very nice . All function are work very nicely and also useful .All over experience is unbelievable. Once again Thankyou Flipkart and installation team.",
            "I bought this TV with some expectation as I understood that this is an international brand. But not as expected.\n\nWhat i like:\n1) Light weight. Easy to cary. (But we don\u2019t carry or change location all the time)\n2) Easy to setup, hope most of the TVs now a days are simple to setup.\n3) latest android and most of the apps are installable. How ever i saw still some app are not available but sufficient apps are available.\n4) Happy with the 4K quality at this price range. Sony and Samsung have excellent picture quality but we need to spend 1/3 more money than this one.\n\nWhat i don\u2019t like:\n1) Picture clarity for HD content where colours are not bright enough (even after changing multiple setting from options). So for regular videos like 720p quality or HD quality its not so good.\n2) Black levels are badly controlled. When you see a night scene, darkness is really bad. Blackness will have lot of red dots which will definitely not give a good fell of watching it.\n3) Navigation buttons on remote are very close especially down navigation & home button and up navigation and google voice assistance. When we try to use up and down buttons one will press home and google assistance buttons. So always we have to look at remote before operating.\n4) Sound is average. I felt sound quality is same as a 6years old hd tv what i have. But little clear at high volumes. I have to check with an external out put.",

The buttons too are not very good\n3) Noticed lag in UI on the first day itself especially while using the Google assistant. I do not use Google Assistant regularly but I tried it just to\ntest and noticed significant lag.\n4) Looks: You get what you paid for, this TV doesn't look premium at all. Anybody can look at the TV and say it's a budget TV",
            "Product satisfies all the mandatory requirements one who looks to have an android TV.. Only one improvement could be in wall mounting bracket. May be one who is living in compact homes will find it bit risky of getting TV hit accidentally. Distance between TV panel and wall behind it is huge due to bracket depth is more comparatively. It should be short i guess. Leaving that its worth buying in this price range.",

            "The Picture Quality is outstanding at the price point. The colors clarity and Brightness will amaze you. But you will surely need external speakers for the clarity and atmos effect. Speakers of TV has a loud noise and dialogues are not clearly heard.\nIt's a Amazing Product in all.",
            "Display and sound quality is awesome..if you want to buy budget smart tv go for hisence.connectivity is faster. You can cast almost any smart phone. SD, HD, FHD every tipe of video play well. 4k Videos is awesome..24w sound is loud and clear. You can also connecte bluetood sound bar or home theater. Bluetooth Remote is good.. Flipkart service is also good.. I received Nexy day delivery and day afer installation.. Delivery and installation boys are polite and beave well. Valu for money.\nI saw MI , TCl, oneplus and some other tv qualities but hisence is best from those.go for it.\nFor display 5/5\nSound 5/5\nConnectivity 4.5/5",
            "A genuine review that should be liked (Y)\n\nIt's been a week since I am using the TV. The picture quality is really good and the sound is also decent. The response time of TV is also great. It's a great full-featured android TV. Chromecast, Bluetooth, and Wifi connectivity are very good. The picture quality and features of this TV is definitely better than MI, TCL, iFallcon, Nokia, Motorola and OnePlus for sure!\n\nPlease Note:-\n\n1) I got the defective TV first and then it got replaced and reinstalled within 7 days so that was quite a bad experience for me. So please be careful about the TV because many people get defective TV when it comes to Hisense. That's the reason I have to give it 4 stars.\n\n2) Hisense is also supplying TV to VU so FYI VU and Hisense are the same TVs. This is the reason I went for the Hisense as it's a bit cheaper than VU premium.\n\n3) The SD channels will just be watchable on this TV, so I will suggest that this TV will be useless if you do not have HD channels. Just buy any HD TV if you wish to watch SD channels.\n\n4) I got this TV @ Rs 32,999 only and got 4 years warranty that's the main reason I bought this TV.",
            "Simply superb product\nPicture and sound quality nice\nConnectivity is awesome\nCast function above android Oreo versions easily connect, below version little bit tough.\nVoice activated blue tooth remote control work super and Google assistant reply responsible is quickly\nFinally my opinion is value for money and five years warranty ( panel only) is good choice for budget segment in this product very good. My review is last six days. After one month complete more comments will publish. Thank you flipkart delivery and installation.",
            "Very happy with the product, Flipkart quick delivery and the installation. As per the promotional offer from Hisense my 55\" tv will be under warranty of coming 5yrs.Product satisfies all the mandatory requirements one who looks to have an android TV..\n\nSuperb fantastic and fabulous pictures quality This range.",
            "Its been 14days of usage. Really good tv. Picture quality is just excellent. Sound is also clear and have good quality with average bass. This TV has Dolby vision, it will get activated when you play content which support dolby vision (I have seen some comment which mention that it doesn't have dolby vision). The operation is smooth, didn't experience any lag. I have purchased TV on 26th of July, so got 4years Manufacturer Warranty. Overall happy with the product. Initially i was little worried because of many negative reviews, stating screen bleeding issues.. But i guess the issue is with the initial batches, now its totally cleared by the company. Anyway you can go for it, below 30k, 4K Ultra HD tv, with dolby vision and Dolby atmos sound really worth it. It also support dual band wifi. I can't find any negative as of now, fully satisfied with the product. In between i just tried to call customer care just to get an idea about their service and responds, with ease, jst by dailing their customer care no, i got connected with the customer executive.. Overall great TV. Really impressed with the picture quality and color accuracy, its vivid, vibrant and beautiful. Played some 4k video of wifelife..oh my god.. just mind blowing. If you are looking for a 4k tv within 30k limit, then this tv is one of the best option. You just compare with Blaupunkt TV also.. it is also good and getting positive reviews. So you can go with either Hisense or Blaupankt.\n\nSo final verdict- Very much satisfied with the TV, picture quality - 10/10, Sound 7/10, connectivity- 8/10, Features - 9/10, Operation smoothness - 10/10\n\n(If any issue occurs, I will update my Review for sure)",
            "I was looking at 55 inch TVs in 30-40k kind of a price range and to be honest, I am quite choosy when it comes to relatively big ticket purchases. I researched a bit and found out about Hisense, it's probably the biggest brand out of all the budget TVs available, just that it is new in India. Bought this with a 3 year complete care warranty as well.\n\nPros:\nPicture quality\nSound (Even 30 watt speakers sound amazing, I am going to connect it to additional speakers that I have, however the Tornado variant with JBL speakers is also available at a little higher price)\nDual Band Wifi, probably the only TV under 40k to offer and really important\n16GB internal space makes it really comfortable and the performance quite smooth\nDolby Vision HDR with Ultra dimming make the experience really great.\n\nCons:\nJust the one.. I wish the remote built quality was a bit better and the buttons more ergonomically placed (eg. You will end up pressing the home button quite frequently when you will want to press down)\n\nAll in all probably the best 55 inch TV that there is in the market even under 50k price range. A must buy!!",
            "Positive:\nTV is good for the price\n- Picture quality can't be better at this price\n- Viewing angles are also Good for VA panel\n- Sound is loud (Sound Quality is OK)\n- HDMI ARC feature is also good (Connect Home Theatre)\n- Chromecast works like charm\n- Upscaling is also fine (1080p content looks good, 720p is still watchable)\n- TV looks premium\n- Has Dolby Vision & HDR10 support\n\n\nNegative:\nOnly concern I had with this order is that I didn't get Google Nest Mini @1500inr. I got a email saying you can get Google Nest Mini @ 1500 but it didn't reflect in my Flipkart account and nobody responded to my mail from Flipkart.",
            "After going through so many reviews from all the most popular Youtubers, i bought it. Indeed it's a good TV . I'm having issues with Bluetooth connectivity when connecting to the Blutooth speakers, i wanted to return for the same reason but not sure i couldn't take it forward. So I am using it now, it feels good. I can give 4 Star for this TV consider that fact that it is a good TV under Budget TVs.\nPicture: 4 Star\nSound: 4 Star\nConnectivity: 3Star\nBody and Build Quality: 4.5 Star\nFlipkart Courier Services:\n3.5 Star (If someone is really concerned about this rating, kindly reach me for the feedback)\n\nAs of now really having a satisfactory feeling about using this TV, not sure about Future. Fingers Crossed \ud83e\udd1e\ud83d\ude42",
            "Best TV in this budget. I was waiting for VU, but it was not available till now. Finally bought this 55 inch\nIt's awesome. No issue. It's very fast and produces very good picture and sound, however there is a little difference when atmos turned off. I liked the theater mode.\nOnly drawback I found the plastic body and the ports which is a little flimsy.",
            "This is literally the best TV you can get in the price point as of today.. the colors are well calibrated in the calibration picture style.. you can further tweak the picture to your liking if you want.. the sound is actually pretty decent for an inbuilt set of speakers.. although i didn't use it for long.. the setting up hardly took any time.. i was a bit skeptical that there'll be light bleeding.. but it's a VA panel as far as i know and there's very little bleeding.. the colors are really uniform.. but where it really shines is HDR 4k content.. i can assure you .. you can not get a better picture quality anywhere else at this price point even near this price point.. overall if at all this thing comes into stock again.. go for it.. it's a good deal!",
            "I m using hisense 43 inch UHD TV from last 10 days, this product is realy a value for money product.\nPicture quality is awesome. Sound quality is very good.\nThe only issue I am facing is with REMOTE of this TV, it is not so responsive if u press 10 time then is work 6-7 time only. Other wise picture quality wise and sound quality wise it's a good product",
            "Hi i ordered this 43 inch tv during sale and got it within provided time also installed and demo done timely\nReally a big tv very nice picture and sound quality connectivity is also good for Ott content but mind well for that you have to a good speedy internet than its working like a charm.\nNice experience with tv a small problem arised at initial for downloading the app from play store but after contacting customer care it's solved on fone a tweak of setting\nOnly difficulty i feel now is non hd Chanel is running with very slow sound and HD channels are coming with a very rock solid sound.\nYou didn't need any sound bar if you aren't hear very loud sound\nIt's also having facility for adjusting the led backlight level it's rare found in this price range\nUltra dimming is also good blacks are dark black\nOver all a fine TV in this price range\nWill update after 3 month uses about more experience",
            "Picture quality is excellent. Sound is good too. Only issue few of the apps doesn't work but hey if you are techie you can play with Android. Excellent choice at this budget. Will always recommend to others even after using it for couple of months",
            "Picture quality is good if you are watching from front.Viewing angles very poor so if you want to set it up for your living room then go for tv with IPS panel. Sound quality is good . Dolby vision in netflix is not that great but youtube 4K videos look great. HDR movies through blueray player or stremio app is great but netflix UHD movies or series are treat to watch. I don't like picture quality in dolby vision due to lot of grains visible in movie. Sound quality through ARC in my home theater has improved a lot. I watched movie Gemini man , which was a treat to watch. I even tried to watch netflix content through MIbox which gave better quality as compared to native netflix app.\nLot of improvement is required in software for better picture clarity.\nHD channels through airtel box looks great. SD channels are also ok to watch.\nOne thing which I noticed that in CPUZ app its display is shown as having resolution 1920 X 1080 p not 3140 X 2160p.",
            "Hisense is the best tv for budget category.\nThe picture quality is amazing.\nSound quality is good.\nThere were no issues in connectivity.\nService and installation did there job very well.\nAnd we very extremely happy for timely delivery and installation.

            "Product is very good compared to its price tag.. Main and important thing I got 4 year comprehensive warranty. I wait 4 months to write this review. Till the date I didn't face any kind of issues. Anyway there is some kind of quality issues, I can agree but according to its price tag I am just ignoring it. If you need better quality you can go for Sony, Samsung or LG....But you have to pay almost double the amount. Remote is little bit tricky because of its key configuration. I am totally happy with this product till I write this review..",
            "Searched a lot for good budget tv and reached on Hisense. Didn't dissapoint. Value for money. Picture quality is best at this price range and technology. Sound is also good. Good buy overall.\n\nAdder after 2 month use : Tv not responding to remote power on button. Frustrating. Hope will get some solution soon.",
            "Hisense TV met the expectations and has been functioning seamlessly. The connectivity is good, 4K clarity is as advertised. The impressive part is the sound, the 30W is quite sufficient. I did not see a need for a sound bar or other accessories. The voice remote as well is functioning good. The drawback was with installation, the technician was not so well knowledgeable. This is a valuable product that you can invest your money into. Please ensure that you spend that extra money to get the additional warranty and a good stabilizer ",
            "Everything is perfect for the price in this TV. Wished it had dedicated fully functional MEMC also. Else, Picture quality is just great. Black levels are Awesome.\nTIP: while watching in dark, use good quality LED STRIP on the back of TV Panel, it inhances the TV experience to the next level. In this way, you enjoy OLED type black levels.",
            "Superb picture quality, crisp colors and deep blacks. Good viewing angles, despite having a VA panel. Sound is not very thumping as you expect in a tv speaker, but very loud and clear. Build quality could have been better, specially the stands, feels a little clumsy. Design is awesome, literally bezel-less in three sides. HDR and Dolby Vision contents are treat to eyes. I played PS4 Slim on this, no such input lag noticed in sport games like FIFA, UFC and NFS, HDR is nice and crisp, played RDR2, Battlefield, world and characters look very rich and detailed. MEMC isn't there, so motion blur is noticeable. I just hope now it would have a good longevity. Overall, a good value for money!!",
            "The Best in the Class.\nI have researched for a best value for money TV with every specs for more than 8 months ...after watching the reviews for all TVs i have selected Hisense A71f 50 inch model... & I'm totally satisfied with my purchase on 04/06/2021.\nI suggest everyone who are planning to buy TV under 42 thousands...

            "If I have to describe this TV in few words then I would say it is Value for Money. You will get more what you have paid. If your budget is around 25k-27k then go for this TV. 4K quality is great and all your apps would work without any issue. I have been watching Netflix(in 4K),Prime video,Hotstar, etc etc and they all work great.\nSound is also great and connectivity with wifi and other Bluetooth devices is flawless. All I would say is go for it also this is made in India.",

            "Good quality product in this price range, Initially I was little worried about the brand presence in India but after enjoying the output for last 20 days I can say it's good choice no regrets.... Happy buying..",
            "Picture quality good. 4k videos are outstanding.\nSound is loud enough with clarity. No need for a soundbar, though don't expect any magic with the supposed dolby atmos inbuilt.\nGets booted quickly.\nUpscaling is good for 720 and 1080 not so much for lower resolutions.\nStrangely hdmi cec doesn't work properly with Yamaha soundbar Y 108 and in fact requires cranking up the volume quite high when connected to the soundbar. Sounds better without the soundbar though the bass is a bit muted.\nRemote is a pain. The TouchPad needs to be looked at visually to use it. Too close to the Google assistant button which gets pressed mistakenly everytime you use the top most part of the TouchPad.\nBluetooth works well. Headphones get connected instantly once you pair them.\nIn conclusion more of a value for money tv",
            "Amazing picture quality.. don't expect home theatre quality sound from a flat screen TV.. speakers do the job efficiently.. the remote doesn't feel premium though.. overall, I'm a satisfied customer.. money well spent as far as I'm concerned..",
            "Picture : 4/5\nSound : 4/5\nLook & Feel : 4/5\nApps : 5/5\nFlipkart Service : 5/5\n\nAn affordable Android TV. This is near bezelless design which implies that there are small bezels on the 3 sides. Supports 4K videos and the UI is intuitive. Sound is also good for a medium size living room (do not see an immediate need for external sound bar). Supports if not all most of the Apps (Netflix, Prime, Hotstar, Zee5, LIV, YouTube). The remote control has dedicated buttons for major apps. Not experienced any lag till now and works smoothly.\n\nTV was delivered in 2 days and installation done on the next day. So pretty satisfied with the delivery service.",
            "Great Buy!! I was looking to buy established brand like samsung, sony etc. Then i thought of giving a try considering Hisense is global brand and OEM. It is maximum bang for bucks. Picture quality is great sound is awesome. Android looks almost stock with minimal tweaks. It supports all the latest tech like HDR, HLG, Atmos, Vision. Plays 4K 60fps like a charm. Upscaling (SD) is also good. At this price point and 5 years warranty, there is no competition. It is winner hands down. Just go for it (Made in India)",
            "Best tv in 40k range, picture quality is awesome ,dolby sound and dolby vision works great but very few content available in youtube to support this, upscaling and ultra dimming works as a charm.hassle free connectivity ,no lag .Overall good upgrade from mitv 4a(lag too much).loved clean ui.I would recommend especially before 16 aug as 5 years panel warranty bonus you get.\nOne con as memc is missing. But i am expecting too much i guess.",

            "Purchased 55inch ledtv on 8th Aug, 2020. Best tv for budget purchaser.....which can give top tier tv manufacturers a run for their money. Only feature missing is QLED which would have provided local dimming for darker blacks and higher refresh rate but to get that u would have to shell out 30k more to get one plus QLED tv which was my first choice...but the extended warranty of 5 years closed the deal in favour of Hisense. After purchasing and seeing the picture quality you will find very little difference and negligible to human eye. OVERALL BEST COST BENEFIT RATIO LED TV",

Delivery and installation is very good\nPicture quality is awesome and 30W sound speaker is good with nice bass no need of soundbar\nOnly one problem which i was faced that at starting time it takes extra 3 to 5 sec to load the home screen\nValue for money",

Hence value for money product in 2k22 also if your willing to buy go for it without any hesitation if your getting this in lower price... Comparatively this tv is best rather then this so called banded Motorola and Nokia tvs which doesnt have proper after sale service.",
            "Remarkable television set at this price point. Complete value for money. Picture quality is good and sound is also loud. More app support and better software would had been a cherry on the cake. Satisfied customer.",

            "Picture quality is Ok. TV speaker sound is pretty good, speech is clear. I am okay with this budget TV except the below points.\n\n1. The remote keys are placed in a inconvenient manner. I end up pressing the home button instead of the down arrow button. So need to see the remote button before pressing the keys.\n\n2. Bluetooth headphone needs to be paired everytime before usage. It stays paired but cannot be connected later unless unpaired and again paired. Pretty much unexpected.\n\n3. The TV randomly switches the picture modes by itself. And surprisingly, the saved picture settings reset after the TV is restarted. Highly unexpected. And pretty irritating.\n\n4. Picture looks clear but in moving scenes, it's bit blurry. Still, I can't comment on that since I have not compared multiple 4K TVs, so that may be an issue with budget 4K TVs\n\nGet this TV as a secondary option if your budget is limited.",

            "After using for almost 90 days this smart tv is quiet good in this price of 26.5k.Do not compare with samsung, LG, sony but for this budget I think this is the best.

But no latest Android update working on android 9.",

It connects but it shows \"no internet \".\nWhen I compared with Sony Bravia's sound quality.. Hisense is little low.. specially for dolby sound. I don't find a good dolby sound in it. I use my tv through internet only. Screen mirroring is poor. These are all cons..\n\nBut if you keep all these aside, then it is a beautiful tv with less price and equipped with more features. I recommend this product.",

May be this problem because of cable operator...I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT I THINK NO ONE IS BETTER THAN HISENSE IN THIS PRICE RANGE BEST IN THE MARKET AT THIS TIME...",
            "Picture, sound, connectivity, and built are awesome. Definitely value for money. Installation is good and brightness and Ultradimming technology is mindblowing and definitely better than VU tv. VU tv was the best in market at its whole package before this Hisense Tv but the picture smoothness and sharpness and colour management of Hisense is very nice and ease to eyes during long time of watching.\nThough brightness is not mentioned in the Hisense tv but but after using VU PIXELIGHT (400nits brightness) I can say that I is nearly 330 to 350 nits for Hisense and at this brightness with Ultradimming technology give your eyes a smooth viewing ability without stress.\nThus I recommend you this tv without 2 nd thought at this price.. Definitely go for it.",

In spite of switching to Speech audio mode, the Sound of instruments is very high, there by you can't hear clearly the Dialogues and speech.\nIf you want go in Extra Warranty other than the company one for another 2 years then go for it provided by FLIPKART at the time of purchase of the TV itself, which is Rs 2400 which covers buyback also upto 2 years. I purchased extra 2 year warranty at the time of Year Installation by Jeevs. And I paid Rs 2965, which not only costs Rs 565 extra at the same time there is no buy back coverage as provided by FLIPKART online purchase.\nLet me review completely after 2 months use.",

I have an LG and VU TV(Vu doesn't manufacture TV, Hisense TVs get rebranded) as well but trust me at this price Hisense is the winner. Best picture quality, good sound and al connectivity options makes it a leader. 3 years warranty is not available in lot of other big brands.",
            "Awesome picture quality and one day delivery and one day installation everything works fine display is quite awesome",
            "It a good buy at this price range.\n\nAfter using it for two months, very much satisfied with picture quality and sound.\n\nEspecially Sound is best compared to all the TV currently available.\n\nScope of improvement ::\n\nRemote build quality can be improved.\n\nNo issues with the size, shape or connectivity.",
            "Value for money, it's really a very good product everything is excellent but still I have wait for one year which is not completed. Sound is excellent, Colours are also very good easy to connect with mobile. I suggest to the customer it is a very good product can go for it.",
            "Picture quality is too good . The sound is so sweet and clear . Really the product is too good. I like this product very much .",
            "Picture quality is decent but the edges are a little blurry. Back light control works moderately to adjust that but doesn't give full hd feel.\nSound quality is awesome which is the main feature. It gives a feel of little base with adequate volume.\nOS doesn't remember the last viewing source. It starts with default mode everytime television is switched on. That's bit of frustrating.\nOverall a good choice according to it's size and price range.",
            "5G connectivity and superb connectivity within 2 sec.\nSound quality is good overall good product in reasonable price.",

            "After a month of use, I can say the TV has a great picture quality and sound output. It works fine with any home theater or soundbar connected. One drawback is, I have to give access to HDMI control to enable ARC each time I switch on the TV. Dolby buttons and features are only accessible when hearing from TV speakers. It has a special wall mount feature too, which splits the sound which gives better clarity. Overall a great product. Things can be improved are Refresh Rate and ARC to eARC. Loved it.",
            "Definitely worth the money, but personally not satisfied with its clarity. Being a budget TV, I can't expect more. However, the clarity can be improved for all the hype in its specification. Feels like a Full HD tv in my opinion.",

Happy with this.\n\nThanks to Flipkart for prompt delivery and installation.",

            "Best Value for the Money\nReviewing after a weeks performance, One off the best picture quality in this price range..... I used VU and Thomson earlier but the quality of this is far superior and anyone can go ahead without any second thoughts in budget 4k UHD segment",
            "I am satisfied with Hisense till now I didn't find any issue and I think it's value for money, Installation is quick and good picture quality ND sound it instantly connected with other device.I recommended to buy it if it is in reasonable price only.",
            "Hi all just want to say big thanks to hisense tv customer satisfaction department who just called me after seeing my review on flipkart. It was great experience with them as I m feeling proud that I become part of this lovely organization who looks after their customers problem. It's much appreciated. Now I have believed that they will resolve my issue asap. So those who have doubt that what kind of service hisense will provide. So I want to say all of you to don't worry about that they are very professional in their work and you will get best service for sure.",
            "Wish I could give 6 stars on value for money. The picture quality is really appreciated at this price point. I'm currently comparing this one with my SONY BRAVIA 43X7002E (brought from flipkart in 2017, has horizontal black lines now) - the difference is evident.\n\nI don't want to give pictures of TV display quality as this will misguide people. You will have to enjoy the display from the TV itself and trust me, it won't let you down. 4K 10bit HDR Contents run smoothly. Netflix DOLBY VISION Contents are really mind blowing. I will need to re-watch all those in this TV again. Missed so many details in the Sony one.\n\nVery well managed and early delivery. Open box delivery was done by delivery executive. Had a little hiccup for installation, but negligible.\n\nOverall a great satisfaction, I was longing to buy a Hisense TV since 2010. Finally it came true.",
            "After watching some 4k video I didn't impressed that much as it advertise . As per my view this TV is can get you good picture quality and little of upscaling but the brightness is not that much to watch 4k or HDR videos . the only thing matter to me is picture which compromise on brightness .\n\nBuilt quality is good\nConnectivity is good\nPicture quality and brightness is good enough for the price\nNo ultra dimming only for advertise",

            "I am writing this after 2 months of usage.\n\nTLDR; If you are just upgrading from an older and less smart TV , this will serve well. But if you already have used good TVs this may disappoint you slightly.\n\nI got this delivered in just 2 days and got it installed in the next 2 days, so the delivery and service were awesome. Now lets come to the TV performance.\n\nPros\n- Decent picture quality\n- Good amount of storage\n- Android-based TV\n- Have almost all ports\n- Sound loudness is impressive\n\nCons\n- It is sometimes a bit laggy and skips some remote commands when its unresponsive, this doesn't happen frequently, so overall it is smooth.\n- Picture quality is good, but there are TVs with better picture quality in the same range. eg. Toshiba.\n- Sound quality is just average and all these Dolby Atmos are just a gimmick. If you are into classical music/Bollywood classics, this will disappoint you because the voice clarity isn't good.\n- Remote control is poorly designed and has bad ergonomics.\n- My TV keeps developing an issue with the home launcher where it stops navigating vertically and the normal selection turns into a long press (just on the home screen). I reset my TV and it got fixed, but only for a couple of days and it was back to square one. This is just annoying.\n- As many others have pointed out, The sound output over the Bluetooth and 3.5 MM jack is too low to hear that I need to increase the volume 3 folds.",

            "When I bought this product, it was working as normal but slowly with time it has become bit slow. Its a value for money product and it may not be fair to compare the product with big brands which cost at least twice of this tv. Only one issue I see is the viewing angle. Once we are off the center, the picture quality becomes little different.\n\nHave have been using an oled tv in my living room since 2018 for which I paid 6 times more but this tv is good as well .. I am happy with this ..",

Sound quality is also good as expected from 30w system. Connectivity is flawless and bootup time is fast. The most differentiating factor is thoughtful functions provided on remote. One can directly switch off screen while listening music. Sound and picture mode adjustment from remote. Bluetooth remote with Google assistance.\n\nOriginal review: Flipkart is totally irresponsible partner for delivering such high value products. As per their policy, installation would happen in 2 business working days. But its more than week now since product delivered. No installation happened. On top ,their claim a date for maximum product installation time which matches with my 10 days product return time frame. Multiple times called customer care but no convincing answer given.",
            "I think Hisense is the brand to go for if you can't afford front runners like Sony, Samsung, LG. Hisense is a popular brand across Uae , Europe and offers excellent picture quality in this Segment. Sound is good and even better with Dolby atmos. Build quality is good and android experience on tv is smooth. I am totally impressed with the cinematic experience this 50 inch tv provides. One con worth mentioning would be the screencast issue at times which might be solved in the future ota updates. Overall go for it if you want vivid picture quality and beautiful cinematic experience it's worth the money.",
            "Very nice buy I must say. Comparatively new in Indian market so the manufacturer tries to maintain quality of the product within this budget buy. 1+3 years brand warranty is an additional gift got from the manufacturer due to purchase of product within offer period.

Its not a wow tv but the deal was wow. If there is no money constraint explore Nokia or Samsung tv. If there is money constraint then this is sweet deal.\n\nI would rate it 7/10",

Needless to say the deluvey of flipkart is really fast. 4K resolution is awesome, sound quality is excellent, pre installed apps are good, connectivity is not bad. Really a nice product at this price.\n\nThe major demerit is on the installation part, product not installed as per the time line. Worst service and customer care of hisence is pathetic. Don't know the response of after service from hisence, I am sure it will be nightmare for us if this type of services offered to customer. Buying this TV cheap is an advantage provided if the TV does not create any problem. If anything occurs then we want to have multiple followups with hisence will definitely be a challenge. Hisense has to work on providing a superior service to their customers in order to sustain in indian market. Adding few more inputs of the TV after using it for 4 days. Cannot able to connect with blue tooth, ARC hdmi source, u can connect sound output only through TV speakers which is a massive technical glitch",

            "TV started flickering intermittently on the 4th day after installation. Yet to ascertain whether it's a transmission problem or TV. Not impressed with the sound. Company has been wanting on providing accessories, making the customer pay for flexible wallmount, HDMI purchase and supply the same which does not support 4K. Promised replacement the next day, still awaiting for the replacement.\n\nReview.\nThe flickering was a transmission issue. The promised replacement of HDMI cord supplied by JEEVES was not supporting 4K resolution. Flipkart too washing off hands by putting onus on customer to pay first Rs 350 paid service and later claim reimbursement. The customer is advised to buy a voltage stabilizer, HDMI CORD for better signals and flexible wall mount for better handing of TV. Flipkart reduces price of TV by Rs 1000 in a couple of days after purchase. I assume the prices of products are manipulated as the search about the product is done.\n\nReview\n1) Flipkart should state that the product needs voltage stabilizer as the installation engineer recommends.\n2) The description of Hisense remote states color screen, which is not so and misleading.\n\nWorkmanship:\nNo tie-cord used to tie loose wire spread around the tie. Reflects improvement in workmanship.\n\nHISENSE\nEither reduce cost of wall mount. The installation engineer states drawback of fixed WM and advantages of a flexible wall mount convincing the buyer to opt for a flexible WM costing Rs 1600 extra.\nInstead company can provide a HDMI Cable which the buyer has to purchase for Rs 280 on being convinced for getting digital signal.\nHe advises to opt for a voltage stabilizer to safeguard the product from voltage fluctuations. This costs another Rs 3100.",

I liked it very much the picture quality is fantabulous, sound quality is really good for a normal room size even if it is hall it will not disappoint you. Internet connectivity is also works good. Bluetooth remote works really well some of the people in their review have said that remote doesn't work if you don't put in front of TV. I hope they have forgot to attach with the Bluetooth connectivity if it is connected it will not disappoint you even if you are in the another room it will work from there also I have tested it. Quality of remote is good but the buttons are not well embossed so, most of the times it will confuse you if you will press the something else button which you don't want to press. Every time you have to see before pressing. Hisense should improve the quality & distance of buttons, so that it will be work flawless.\nI was using LCD TV of the Toshiba and Samsung I bought this TV just because 5 year warranty, but I was really doubtful and Confused being a Hisense Chinese company and their quality issues have been raised in India but I can assure you that this TV has not disappointed me at all.\nThe picture quality is really very good it's awesome even with the SD connection it will not disappoint you but if you use with the HD connection and see the HD channels on TV your experience will be awesome only want to say that it is a good value for money and you can go for it without having any doubt in your mind I bought two TVs of hisense 55 inches and 50 inches both are working really well thanks",

With all my earlier TVs, I had used separate sound system, but this tv sound is as good as my f&d sound system. Dialogues are perfectly clear. Though Bass lovers will still need separate sound system.\nUsing it as android TV as well as PC Monitor. Supports 4k hdr10 60Hz in Windows. Just enable hdmi enhanced in LED settings. So absolutely perfect.\n\n\nFurther enhancement required:\n\n1. Wifi connectivity is comparatively low.\n2. A setting should be in TV, so TV directly boot into hdmi. So we dont have to use 2 remotes. A OTA update is urgently required.\n3. When you power off tv by holding power button, then power off, then there is no indication, when system actually powers off. Some indication is required. Ota please.",
