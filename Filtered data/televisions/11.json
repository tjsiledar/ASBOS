            "Review update on 06/03/2022\nReceived software update few days back , sound is good and audio quality has improved , lagging has reduced \ud83d\udc4d\nMi TV 5x 55\u201d delivered on 09/09/2021 & installed on 10th , everything was smooth , TV has a good rich feel with near bezel less Metal frame design , the new adaptive brightness feature is really good , adjusts according to our room lighting making viewing pleasant to eyes , ok google works well , audio is ok not great , some apps volume is good but apps like Apple TV+ have to rise volume to 60 , panel is VA , so contrast is good has good viewing angle up to 120 D after that you will loose color & contrast , other things will update after some days of usage\nAfter 10 days of usage - facing lag in certain apps , loading is also slower , mi needs to update its software , wish mi used Android 11\nAfter 3 weeks\nReceived Appletv+ app update , now the sound is better , mi needs to update software, lag still persists in certain apps , slow booting & have to improve Wi-Fi connectivity",
            "Very good TV. Decent picture quality and sound effect. Value for money. I am just expecting this TV to work for 4 years.",
            "Pros:\n1. Picture quality is perfect(I think it is better than its competitors at this price range)\n2. 4k videos can play perfectly fine.\n3. Bezels are thin.(for people who don't like thick bezels it's a perfect tv).\n4. Patchwall looks good\n\nCons:\n1. The biggest con of this tv is SPEAKERS. I have got 43\" tv which has 30 w speakers (believe me my old CRT tv can produce better sound than this). I think all those Dolby Atmos and stuff are gimmicks. If sound is ur mail priority don't go for this tv. If u have a soundbar then it's fine.\n2. Observed some stutters occasionally, I think it's due to the software. Hope they can fix it via software update.\n3. Sd to hd upscaling isn't upto mark,it could have been better.(if u have a sd settopbox try upgrading it to hd one).\n4. Farfield mic is a gimmick(It will work fine when u r closer, but it can't work properly if u are further).",
            "Posting this review after using this TV for 8 days..\n\n1.Picture quality is just awesome. Every pixel is clear.4k 8k videos just gives you awesome feel.\n\n2.Sound quality is better than previous MI 20w speakers, Sound is loud as this TV having 40w speakers but I am not happy with bass of these speakers. Should have more bass with this price range.\n\n3.Connectivity is good. I am using with 200mbps wifi. Remote is smooth and Google assistant is working excellent.\n\n4. Patchwall and other features are good which gives some nice UI experience.\n\nOverall I am happy with MI 5X TV.",
            "Super awesome mine is 55inch tv got delivered next day of Order but installation is very badd no response from Flipkart. So finaly called mi store and they did it in same day.

            "Coming straight to the point, the tv feels a bit laggy at times. Switching apps takes time. The sound is not upto the mark, tried all settings available to optimize but couldn't. You definitely have to use a soundbar for better experience. I also noticed a bug, the tv automatically redirects to patchwall while playing YouTube videos. Happened once.\nAnother bug I saw, while switching from SD to HD channel, the auto-scalling cropped half of the screen for a while. Switched it off and then on again, dint happen so far.\nPatchwall is great though. Voice commands work perfectly so far. Picture quality is good.\n\nI feel there are a lot of bugs that might be mitigated in the upcoming updates. Hoping for the best. \ud83e\udd1e",
            "Great Buy.!\nEdit- recieved a new update in March 2022 and the sound performance has increased to a great extent.\nI was in confusion after seeing the ratings given by people but still i went for it.\nAnd i must say the TV is great and i am happy with it completely.\nI have 50 inch varient.\nDisplay- details are great. Red colour is a bit overwhelming, but after a few tweaks in the Picture settings it is absolutely stunning. Watching cricket matches, movies is absolute delight.you can increase the backlight and adjust contrast,brightness as per your liking.\nSound-\nSound is great but i would recommend to enable the Dolby processing from settings menu to get the best out of it.\nI haven't increased the volume above the level of 20 in my usage.\nI am attaching few pictures which might not give justice to the actual quality of the TV.\n\nINSTALLATION- it was done by Jeeves. I had to call the installation guy 4 to 5 times from morning and after that he came to install.\nDelivery- was done 2 days before expected date so the installation was done after 3 days. No complaints about delivery.\nRemote- it is responsive and very tactile. A bit small to hold but works great.",
            "I was confused between samsung Crystal 55 UHD and Mi 5x 55 UHD, by oaying a premium of 5000 i could have bought samsung easily and it us a reouted brand too, so i was on the way of research, watched a lot of vudeos, camparisons, separate reviews, and i came to the conclusion, anyway both tvs are using VA panels, and my sudden thought was a TV which costs premium of 40k plus still having VA, it cant acceptable but since almost evwry manufactures use same tech we cant complain, if you have little more bucks to pay go for qled which is much more worth for penny spent,\n\nAgain to the point for the price we are paying Samsung not giving enough functionality which even Mi gives so MI leads there even supports HDMI 2.1 Which samsung Lacks. But Samsung crystal 4k processor does optimization more effective than MI so if you want better picture quality go for Samsung and connectivity and functionalities are your main need stick with Mi 5x which is much more value for money\n\nBuild quality Mi leads over Samsung, since samsung buikd feeo cheap plastic over the bezels and MI steel bezels gives look and touch of premiumness.",
            "I have been planning to buy tv from 3 months and atlast I choose Mi 5x which is an all rounder in this price segment.\n\nPros:-\n1)Picture quality is very good and very accurate\n2)Adaptive brightness is impressive but there is a con too..\n3)New patchwall is just awesome but a very few lags which may be resolved with an update.\n4)Metallic design makes the tv very stylish\n\nCons:-\n1)Sound is very flat and not that good ( No bass )\n2)Adaptive brightness sometimes not is very low responsive which I Observe\n3)MEMC is not that good but ok in this price range\n\nOverall The TV justifies the value.",
            "Don't listen to all the reviews and all that BS about the panel being not bright enough for HDR or won't be visible in areas with too much natural light. The tv viewing experience is very good albeit the sound is ok, the bass is not boomy if you are wondering that. If you are buying this tv i would suggest you to invest in a good soundbar or a home theatre system. Coming from a Sony 3d tv to this is not at all a disappointment. If you are going to buy this tv you won't be disappointed. And al...\nREAD MORE",
            "Installation is not at all good . They are handling the tv very carelessly .\n\nTv thought is out standing picture quality.\nSound is like okay okay can be better.\nApp support is not responding properly",
            "Fabulous TV , I bought 43'inch segment ,it's looks premium TV\nPicture quality JUST WOW\ud83d\ude0d\u2764\ufe0f\nDolby Sound is Awesome \ud83d\ude0d\nConnectivity also good , I Loved it.\nJust go for it without any doubt.",
            "Product is very very awesome .\nPicture quality upto mark .\nSound quality value for money .\nDelivery and installation are more than my expectation(awesome).\nNote : installation same day that day tv delivered and delivery persons are too good as behavior.\nSo , my recommendation to who want MI to buy this\nThank you MI \ud83d\ude0a",
            "Simply Best in this segment... I was fear to purchase but now I am happy for this. superb picture quality ( after ambitious light Off in picture Setting )",
            "Colour brightness is not good as compared to my previous Sony 32 LED.\nDull pictures not satisfactory to see.\nI lost my interest to see TV after I got this TV.\n40W speak is only name sake, it will not even match 20W,\nLyrics no clarity . Low bass.\nMusic is not pleasant\nUltimately bad buy.",
            "TV is installed after 5 days. Bit frustrating. But overall the product is really good and I like it. Good job MI",
            "Initial impression was very good, nice 4k tv, picture clarity is very good in this price range, sound also good loud and clear\nWill write detailed review after some days of use",
            "Good TV with nice looks and feature. Worthy for the budget segment to which it belongs. However picture could have been more crisper especially for the non-4k contents. But definitely a worthy buy in this price segment.",
            "It is a brilliant tv at this price point. It has all the features I was looking for and met and exceeded my expectations in some areas, see below for a detailed review of the Mi TV 5X 55 inch:\n\nPicture quality\n\nAll the bells and whistles apart, picture quality is the most important thing when you look for a tv. The picture quality on this is tv natively is decent because android tv doesn\u2019t do a great job at picture quality, but I have hooked it up to an Apple TV 4K and it brings out the best from this TV, the picture quality is brilliant with 4K Dolby Vision turned on. Don\u2019t believe the negative reviews because to get a good output you need good input, so if you like to see the full potential of the tv invest in a fire stick 4K or Apple TV, you won\u2019t regret it! \ud83d\udc4d however I don\u2019t recommend watching this TV on the native android OS mode! \ud83d\ude09\nBlacks are pretty good too and please don\u2019t make the stupidity of comparing this to an OLED tv because you have to look at the price point and value for money. Colours are vibrant and clarity is great but you will have to tweak the settings a bit to achieve this, will take you about 2 mins!\nViewing angles are good and the screen does show some distortion in colour when you see it from a steep angle but no one would watch tv from such extreme angles so don\u2019t worry about it! \ud83d\udc4d\n\n\nSound quality\n\nThe speakers do a great job producing crisp sound and great surround effect with Dolby Atmos and surround sound turned on. You can\u2019t expect a lot of bass from tv speakers but there is a hint of bass. Dialogues sound crisp and lively, music surrounds you with great clarity. Invest in a good Dolby Atmos enabled soundbar to enjoy the full potential of the TV\u2019s sound.\n\nConnectivity\n\nThere are 3 HDMI 2.1 ports and one of them is an e-Arc enabled port. I have connected an Apple TV 4K and a PS4 to the tv and both work flawlessly. It supports both 2.4 and 5ghz Wi-Fi networks. The built in chromecast works flawlessly too.\n\nGaming\n\nThe tv has auto low latency mode and since it has HDMI 2.1 ports, gaming experience is great and lag free. Colors are amazing and the edge to edge screen elevates your experience a notch high! You will love it! \ud83d\ude09\n\nFeatures\n\nDolby Atmos, Dolby vision, HDR 10 all work as advertised on Netflix, prime video, Hotstar etc. Again I would like to stress, use a good input device like the fire stick 4K or the Apple TV 4K to truly enjoy these features in this tv.\nSaying OK Google triggers the Google assistant instantly as the far field mics on the tv are brilliant no matter which input mode you are on! You can switch it off if you don\u2019t want it on.\ud83d\udc4d\nThe auto brightness sensor works well too adapting itself to the light around.\n\n\nDesign\n\nThe design of the this tv is stunning and feels very premium!\nThe screen is edge to edge and feels much bigger than it already is. It is very slim and looks great whether you wall mount it or place it on the sturdy metal stands provided in the box.\n\nSummary\n\nOverall this TV has been a great buy for me as it met all the expectations I had and exceeded on some! If you are in the market for a good looking tv with all the latest features and good picture quality your search ends here! \ud83d\ude09\nGo ahead and buy it, highly recommended! \ud83d\udc4d",
            "*Delivery was more then expectation.\n*Installation was also on time by quite professional & skilled person from flipkart\n*picture, Sound & other features are impressive.\nOverall nice experience with my new Mi 5x 55 inch smart tv\nGo for it without any dought.",
            "I am satisfied and the installation team was flawless totally pleased but i would suggest getting sound bar with it which i did with boat 2050 sound bar great combination also the ui is bit laggy but i think it can be easily fixed with some future updates.",
            "After one month of use giving review about the tv\nThe best in segment searched a lot to book this.\ntv is amazing in picture quality and also good at sound like it so much, it never disappoints you.\nJust go for it.",
            "Awesome Purchase, Value for Money.\nTV is fantastic, all features in less price than other brands.\nResolution and picture quality is awesome, Sound is not loud but its good, all important ports are given at side however AV, Lan and optical port are little deep from bottom can be managed as we are not changing them frequently.\nOver all 4.5 out of 5 and a recommended purchase.",
            "Sound is big let down for ne, it's loud but no clearty... just noise. Can enjoy any movie without headphones.\nColour are also not natural,and display looks cheap, even full hd TVs of good brand tv ( like Samsung/LG/Sony) look far superior than this cheap 4k\nSadly no returns option with TVs only replacement...so i m stuck with it\nAnd seeing so many good reviews of this tv really unbelievable... whether no one of them have seen good TV yet..",
            "This is one of the best television experience one can get for the price. Although the speakers don't have a lot of bass, the sound is rich and enough for a moderate sized room. The panel sometimes finds difficulty in displaying 4K hdr videos but overall the best in the price range.",
            "I'm writing this review after one week. The picture quality is superb not very very good but yeah good. The downscale is not impressive but average. OS works smoothly i didn't feel any lags. Basically my hall is not a bright area even at midday hall is dark so the brightness is good for me because of the darkness in my room. But in lights ON the display performance is below average. Biggest CON is the SOUND of the speaker. My god sometime i hate it. Sound changes one video to another.Somtimes its low sound sometime high music sound and low dialogues sound, we can't hear what they saying in video . Speakers are worst.\nBut yeah the overall this purchase give me kind of satisfaction. \ud83c\udf1d",
            "Writing this review after 2 months around from the date of purchase and the product working well so far for me. Dolby vision and Dolby atmos supported movies are looking good on this TV. And for me 43 inch 4K TV is perfect size.",

Picture is awesome sound system is very good though not upto the mark on the tv speaker but i have connected my marq sound bar and it works just fine. Overall highly recommended product from MI. Cheers. !!",
            "Installation of tv too late by Flipkart team . I am waiting 10 day for installation of tv . Mi is best tv in this price range . sound quality is very good . Wifi connectivity is too good. Picture quality is too good .",
            "perfect led tv & best quality quality picture.Many brand of led tv in the market but this one is the best led tv.",
            "Blindly just go for it. After deep consideration, thorough checking of reviews and comparison with other bigger brands like Sony, Samsung and LG. This serves the purpose of a very good TV indeed.\n\nNot regretting a bit.",
            "Such a nice design. Sound quality improved alot compared to 4x. Picture quality is satisfying.",
            "Nice product but the sound quality has to be improved.",
            "Tldr; decent TV obnoxious software optimisation\nPurchased 43 inch variant\n\nPros:\nDecent panel\nGood sound for a small room\n\nCons\nGoogle handsfree randomly activated\nPoor optimisation of software - lags when playing TV series in Netflix and Apple TV. Lag in remote taking input\n\n\nThis is initial feedback.\n\nRating may change later based on how software issue is addressed",
            "picture quality very good",
            "I'm facing a peculiar problem, i don't know if this problem is with my tv or all the tv of this model, the tv getting crashed (tv switch off completely suddenly on its own not just screen off) if the WiFi signal is low ie i kept my WiFi modem in bedroom, if the modem kept beside the tv it working fine. I'm very much disappointed with this.",
            "Pros-\n1. Excellent Picture Quality\n2. Beautiful metal baseless design\n3. Far Field mic is good\n\nCons-\n1. Poor sound quality. Vocals are not clear with Prime Videos and Netflix. You need to keep subtitles on on these two OTT. Rest is okay. Still you need a sound bar for better sound.\n2. UI lags a lot. I don't no when Xiaomi will give an update to fix this. It lags significantly but that is accepted as it is a newer model.\n3. Far field mics sometimes gets activated on its own. This stops the matter playing on screen and it will annoy you.\n4. If you need to change some settings in tv setting like picture or sound, you can't do it without exiting the app you are in. Close everything - go to home - change settings and then re-enter where you were.\n5. I can see some colour flickering on the screen sometimes. 2-5 times so far in past 20 days. I dont know is this a software or a hardware issue.\n6. Every time you start your TV and you left something playing while switching it off, you will see error msg. This is a software Bug. Press back button and you are live.\n\nI have used this TV for 20 days now. Will update after a couple of months.",

Connectivity options are good, HDMI, USB, HDMI-eARC, Optical out. eARC is giving me a better sound output than optical. Installation was smooth and professional. Basic wall stand cost is nominal. Other than that no installation charges. Google assistant is just a fancy feature, won't work too well in a noisy background or if you are too far away. But few basic commands like 'Turn Off the TV', 'Switch to HDMI 1' works well. I would say, overall a good buy. Motion smoothness is noticeable and is an icing on the cake. Overal a good buy, have been using it since a month and a half. MI has maintained the quality.",

Vivid engine, Dolby vision, Reality Flow and all HDR features make the video more realistic. The Dolby Atmos and dts-HD gives you a good sound quality. But I am very very disspointed with the installation company (Jeeves Consumer Services). They didn't come to install the tv. They said they won't come for table top installation. So I did it myself and I succeed.",

But i am not satisfied with product performance.\nIssues:\n1.It lags a lot.\n2.Abruptly apps get crashed (movie will be stopped suddenly and it comes to Home Screen).\n3.It has connectivity issues as well. It look close to 10 minutes to open Netflix.\n4.Sound is ok ok.\nI didn\u2019t like performance at all. Hopefully Mi will come up technical solutions to all the above issues and fix these things in next software push.\n\nIf feel like Mi has pushed an un-tested product to market.\n\nInstallation service is good.",

            "I am giving it 4 stars as i have used the product for over 2 weeks now. I bought a 43\" model. As in picture and sound quality is concerned, it is decent. For a same identical feature tv, sony would cost you around 60k. Now its your choice to buy a tv of your own budget. I think the picture and sound quality is really awesome with the Dolby Atmos and Motion picture features switched on. I only felt disappointed when the tv lags a bit and does take time to load. Ok Google feature is intermittent for me and i am not sure if it is for others as well. I would guess with software updates and performance enhancements the tv would definitely become a beast. The final conclusion i have made is i do not regret buying this product but yes if i had my budget increased a little bit then my options would have been different.\ud83d\udc4d",

But if u know to do the right calibration for picture & sound, you will know that what they claim is to the point correct.\nPeople telling bad sound for this are mostly using default without enabling dolby processing. When u enable, the true effect comes out. Trust me, i don't increase beyond 30 after that, you might have to face complaints from neighbors. Its really loud & surrounding.\nFor this price, what they are giving is totally worth it.\nSoftware is little laggy at times, but can be improved with updates.",
