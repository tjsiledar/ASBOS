            "The Frame- as the name suggests is more for as a decor than being a TV. You can get a better configuration TV at a cheaper price but this one has an edge due to its aesthetics.\nIn standby mode the image gallery gives a look as if an art piece is hanging on a wall. The wallpaper can be put in a slideshow and it keeps on changing.\nOne Connect is another feature which makes this TV almost wire free.

And it fit in just fine.",
            "I was bit sceptical about spending such a big amount of money for a television but this TV didn't disappoint me. Switching from a conventional led TV I was amazed by the picture quality of this TV.\n\nPros:\n1. Awesome picture quality, colors are punchy and picture is sharp. Watched 4k content on Netflix and it looked spectacular. 1080p videos are up-scaled and looked decent (better than my old full HD led TV).\n\n2. Sound quality was decent as TV has 40W sound output. Dialogues were clear and 50% volume was good enough for a mid-sized room. Don't expect too much of bass out the TV speakers but it felt adequate for my taste.\n\n3. Looks and overall design is pretty neat and looks great. Frames USP is art gallery being a part of your TV and it showcases paintings once TV is ideal. You can use it to display images from your personal collection or make collage of your photos and display on it. Overall it felt good and there were enough customisation available within art gallery.\n\n4. Coming to delivery and installation, Flipkart did an awesome job of delivering TV within two days of ordering and installation was done the very next day of delivery.\n\n5. Remote is sleek and has good solid build. Works as universal remote and I was able to even control my fireTV stick with it.\n\n6. For gamers there is a specific gaming mode and HDMI 2.1, also panel has refresh rate of 120HZ which is pretty good.\n\n7. One connect box allows for good cable management and allows you to hide cable clutter.\n\nCons:\n1. Some TVs in this price range offer inbuilt soundbar and much better sound quality.\n\n2. TV runs on Tizen OS and switching from Android TV felt apps were not up-to-date and had some issues while running apps like Voot, Sonyliv. Also, Chromecast felt better experience for casting content from mobile devices.\n\n3. Had to purchase an additional wall mount since no gap wall mount couldn't be used because of switch board on wall. Had to shell out 2.5k for wall mount which is much more adjustable and allows free movement of TV to some extent. (more like a monitor arm)\n\nOverall: This is a great TV given it's price (for 55 inch variant). Picture quality is great with decent audio with few shortcomings in OS. (software shortcomings can be overlooked if you own fireTV or other such android TV box)",
            "Hello\n\nBought this TV, very satisfied delivery was as promised within 2 days, and i set it up on my own as I did not want to wall mount it.... I compared it with the TCL qLed TV and though both are qLed the Samsung was my choice as it had a brighter panel... 400 nits in comparison to 500 nits, and a price difference of just 6k\n\nPicture quality is superb, panel is really bright and is very clear even in a lit up room so no problem there. Blacks are very good though not OLED standard. Colours are really bright and accurate and don\u2019t look over vivid like in Sony (i have).\n\nBetter than the competing Sony and LG models.",
            "This TV (55 inch) is absolutely value for money. It's picture and sound quality are amazing. The upscaling on this tv is also really good and 1080 really feels like just watching 4k content. It has hdmi 2.1, 120hz panel, freesync premium, ALLM and other gaming friendly features which makes it future proof. Some cons are that it definitely has low storage capacity and you'll be left with 250mb after downloading all the essential apps and some apps are not as optimised as they are on Android tv but there is no problem in content viewing. At this price point, there is no better QLED tv out there that can match the quality, features and upscaling capabilities of this panel. It is as good as it sounds and you should definitely go for it.",

            "The TV is good, picture clarity on 4k Netflix and prime is good, there is a smoothness or feels a little easy on the eye, probably that's cos of the high refresh rate.\n\nOnly concern I have is TV is around 3inches think and an inch thinner would have been better. The no gap wall mount is not exactly, there is a gap as the design is not completely single border.\n\nArt mode is good, just that you need to shell out money after the free trial, more free art would solve this problem.\n\nAlexa is not working properly for turning on the TV, i configured with oakremote but still problems in using Alexa for basic switch on and off.\n\nFolks wanting to get a qled and OK to spend a bit, can go for it.",

Thanks Flipkart for the service.\n\nThe TV has good black uniformity and good grey uniformly as well. This is not best as this TV does not have local dimming and direct led.\n\nThe sound is the best part. Well balanced speaker, no need for a soundbar. Deep enough bass for distortion free listening. I tested this against MI qled T...\nREAD MORE",
            "Best tv for the price - bought it at 80.5k. it's the cheapest tv with hdmi 2.1 and 120hz screen refresh rate. I bought it keeping my future Xbox one series x purchase in mind.\n\nThe only downsides I see are:\nViewing angles aren't that great but I installed it in my bedroom. So, that isn't a problem.\n\nBlacks are not as purely displayed on an oled per se but oleds are far more expensive.\n\nUpscaling works great for the most part especially when there isn't so much action going on in the movie/game but during those action scenes, when there is fast paced camerawork; upscaling acts a bit funny especially for movies older than 2010's.\n\nArt mode and ambient mode are a cool addition. Whether or not they are worth considering in your decision making process is a personal choice. I wouldn't say they are a must have and all TV's should follow suit but they are cool.\n\nInability to sideload apps since it's a tizen operating system didn't hurt me (at least as of now). All the apps I wanted (mostly streaming apps) are available in tizen app store.\n\nOverall, one wouldn't regret purchasing especially this 55\" version for the value for money it provides (I wouldn't say the same for other sizes of this tv). One worthy alternative to this tv is lg 55SM9000PTA. It also has hdmi 2.1 port but has only 100hz refresh rate but it probably trumps this tv in providing viewing angles and better operating system (webOS). Not sure how better or worse upscaling works on that tv as I haven't seen it personally.\n\nYou may choose one or other based on what you want from your tv. I chose this as I absolutely wanted a tv with 120hz refresh rate (max fps Xbox games going to play at 4k resolution) and the novelty of having a tv which works as an art piece.",
            "Just in awe of this product, never thought I\u2019d actually advocate something like a tv, but this beauty right here is a head turner, almost everyone who looks at this in our hall thinks it\u2019s a painting. On the other hand the TV too doesn\u2019t fall short of expectations, QLED is amazing and so is the sound quality!

            "This is one of the best TVs in this price range.\nTrue blacks, extremely good contrast, and more than decent peak brightness - the quality of QLED is awesome, you can expect that from Samsung.\nThe 40 watt sound is good, but you may opt for soundbar if you need surround effect and other features.\nThe added advantage is the HDMI 2.1 and 120hz variable refresh rate.\nAll in all a very good TV just like that, keeping in mind that only the 55 inch variant is value for money.\nHowever, the main attraction which sets this TV apart is the look and as the name states, this is a piece of art. One invisible wire, zero gap wall mount and this uniform bezels all around makes it \"The Frame\"\nAll the connections - HDMI, usb, power, everything is via the one connect box which can be hidden anywhere in your cabinet along with other media devices. This TV does not require any fancy expensive tv unit. Probably the only sub 1 lakh TV to have this feature\n\nAll not positive:\nEveryone may not like the OS, although I personally have no issues\nThe default color is over saturated and unnaturally punchy for me - may be because I came from 6 years of Sony and used to the more color calibrated view. You can easily tweek based on your likings\n\nMajor issue:\nInstallation via Jeeves was rescheduled a multiple times and they kept on saying customer requested cancellation. I got fed up and called samsung customer service for installation. They happily obliged and got it done in 24 hours at no extra cost - advantages of big brands. The installation was top notch with actual zero gap flush mount\n\nOverall, this TV is worth buying and you will not be disappointed",
            "The \"Frame\" lives upto its reputation and ticks all the right boxes. This review is after 10 days of usage and the experience has been truly mesmerising.\nThe picture engine does a superb job of upscaling normal HD quality to 4k. Watching movies is a treat. TV speakers are also good for the right sized room. Connectivity is also easy and convenient....connected readily to my bluetooth soundbar.\nThe Art mode is a treat for sore eyes. Samsung gives 3 months free subscription and when you eventually subscribe for it, you end up getting 4 months of free access to the Art services. Only drawback is that the Tizen app store, though it contains the popular apps, is a poor distant cousin of the Google Play Store. Smart things lets you mirror your smartphone screen to your Frame with ease.Overall a very good choice. Truly satisfied. Only regret that I went for the 50\" unit instead of the 55\".",
            "Pricey but worth it for the shape-conscious\nThe Frame is all about looking good on a wall displaying art, and it does that extremely well\u2014far better than any other TV I\u2019ve seen. For that, it\u2019s a stellar product and very, very good overall TV.\n\nThis TV is fantastic for displaying fine art, but it's not the best TV you can buy for the money.\n\nPros\nMounts flush to your wall\nOptional colored bezels available but not in india.\nDoes a great job displaying static art\nCons\nHas only one a 120Hz refresh rate port.\nLess brightness and contrast than Samsung's best TVs\nPricey for Samsung's mid-range TV tech",
            "The biggest disappointment is that the Frame TV doesn't come with Frame which is the USP - its like a car advertised with Sunroof but sunroof is missing and was told by Flipkart that I should have read the contents well enough before placing the order. So its like any other TV for me now.",
            "installation and demo was mentioned free in the invoice but your service personnel charged 750 for additional wall clamp.\nhe was telling the screws provided with the wall adapter is not proper size so either keep the tv on table stand or pay up extra 750 ruppees. a simple metal clamp which also protrudes from the wall . another way of making extra money. I told him if the company provided the wall fittings then they ensures proper screws also. so many excuses.\nbut good TV, picture quality is not that okay. QLED, dark colour ghosting . cute functional remote. sound quality is good.",
            "I feel it is worth every penny.. stands up to its name.. looks exactly like a frame.. u have to pay to get art from samsung though. The one connect box is the best part.. very very convenient.. the one connect cable is much thinner than I expected., almost invisible. Awesome connectivity.. Alexa built in. No google assistant built in but can connect to assistant via samsung smart things app. Screen mirroring works seamless. Best option if u don't want to mess around with all the wires. 65 inch varient is a bit overpriced..",

The demo & installation done on 3rd July which is a quiet impressive during lockdown period.\n\nTV pictures quality: it's nice .. no doubt, samsung have maintained that quality track records in this TV also.\n\nSounds: I have purchased 55 inches tv for that 40 watt sound given in specification but real scenarios it's does seems sufficient for 55 inches big tv where people are sitting a minimum gaps of 6-7 feet. Every time I need to make volume level 75-80 for nice listening. It could be better if samsung would have given a great sound.\n\nValue for Money: I am optimistic because of taken this TV beyond my earlier decided range and converted to 12 months of emi approx rs 6834/- + 189 approx. Although flipkart has given benefit of no interest cost on EMI but still SBI card has charged minimum rs 189 toward the name of govt tax which has not been mentioned. As per given invoice rs76105 after getting no cost on EMI discount.\n\nOther features I love very much of smartthings like connecting mobile to tv parallel and TV to mobile also which we can view tv programs on mobile..",

No doubt in having this TV and its loaded with premium features. Connected wit SONY HT system you can feel watching a movie in theatre. Also the SD upscale is good, you can connect bluetooth ear/headphones or sound bar.\n\n***Only one negative thing is that frame bezel is not available in India to get the frame outlook.\n\nApart from that all the things are EXCELLENT... recomend to buy without second thought in that price range.",

            "VFM for 73k when you compare with Mi tv selling 55' at 55k. You pay 18k more and get 10yr burn in warranty plus this is an Art piece not just any ordinary QLED.\nThe price in India is cheaper than abroad but it's disappointing that samsung doesn't provide frame options , can't event buy it as an add-on. Default Black is not the best looking \"frame\".\nPlenty of customisation options for A/V and a treat for hard-core gamers with 120hz refresh rate. Difference between 50 & 55\" is not much so do consider the 55\" for twice the sound output and better refresh rate. Need min 10ft vieweing distance for ideal consumption.\nAlexa and Google assistant are still half baked.\nTv does not mount flush in the wall, a few mm gap is visible.",

Flipkart's delivery was in just a day & installation was done by professionals on the same day. Spent 3000 more to buy a stabilizer which is adviced as well.\n\nNote- the wall area you planning to mount this TV on should not have even a little elevation. I had a plug point and I made it a dummy before mounting the tv.\n\nYou get 20 free arts only.

The remote interface isn't as friendly navigational as my LG counterpart with mouse pointer.\n2. The frames are add on that costs Rs.14000/- more as an accessory and not included in pack.\n3. Unavailability of 120hz refresh rate for 50\" isn't a pleasant feel as my wall space doesn't fit for 55\" and i am being deprived of an important feature going for 50\" which hurts.\n4. Application are only limited as compared to android.\n\nPros:\n1. Awsome picture quality with the feel of every penny worth for it.\n2. The sound is decent for 16x10 room with good clarity w/o addition speakers.\n3. Value for money as a qled you can afford and experience.\n4. The looks are elegant with top notch feel.\n5.

            "Overall, Samsung' frame TV is something that is advancing your overall home decor and TV viewing experience. Only the installation part which needs to be improved, else everything is perfect! If you're a binge-watcher, you must give this tv a try.",
            "Recently purchased the frame TV.\n\nMust say impressive from the first look itself.\nPicture quality is good tested with 4K videos ( Thanks for it being QLED)\n\nSound is awesome, the speaker has a tinge of bass to it which just enriches the experience. Also the amplifying sound feature is just amazing as it automatically increases/decreases the volume as per your surroundings.\n\nThe software is laggy at times but could improve with updates. Otherwise nice work done on the UX ans UI part.\n\n\nAnd the...\nREAD MORE",
            "I'm writing this review after using the TV for over 4 months. Awesome display and decent sound.\nStartup time is very fast compare to Mi and One plus Tv of same size and config. That's a big plus. It takes me almost 5-10 seconds to start the TV and open my favourite movie/TV show.\n\nAlso no need to worry about connections and wires, thanks to One connect box. But you need to be cautious with the optical cable that connects TV to the box.\n\nAlthough it doesn't have all the streaming apps but it does a decent job in giving all the famous apps. E.g. I couldn't find discovery+ app in the store.\n\nFor TV <> Phone, I couldn't utilise all the awesome options you can do like (Screen mirroring, side by side view, listen via bluetooth ) as I don't have a Samsung smartphone. Also, was not able to cast a lot of content from android apps to TV as TV only showed for youtube.\n\nOverall, it comes with pros and cons and you should buy keeping that in mind. It's aesthetics in the living room is just awesome, no TV could compete with that in this budget. Moreover QLED display works really good even in a lot of natural light.",
            "Wow, I am really surprised with this tv. As the name says it really looks like a photo frame hanging on the wall, especially in art and ambient mode.\nI bought it at 66k approx. Though little above my budget but I'm satisfied with the tv. Most impressive part being the one connect box. All the connections to this one box and one invisible cable to the tv. That makes the tv look stunning on the wall with no or only one cable visible.\nSound quality is decent. The remote is very handy and is a universal remote, we can use it for setup box and tv. It worked with my xbox also. That is a good feature to have.\nThe picture quality is excellent being an oled pannel and when I play games in xbox it enables game mode which make games look very vibrant and sharp. The screen is a bit reflective and you might find it irritating when direct light falls on it. But otherwise as overall package it's an excellent tv in that price range.",
            "Its a wonderful product\u2026 fits on the wall like a frame\u2026 the refresh rate is fast and the sound output is great\u2026 Overall i will rate this product 4.5/5",
            "Very very good.. Picture quality is superb with this QLED TV...Delivery and installation very fast. Installed on the very next day of delivery. One box is a good concept and it makes the TV to look without any wires. Connectivity is fast. Sound quality should be improved ..So I added a sound bar to overcome this. Model is some what heavy than other TVs of the same size and hence fixing should be done on solid wall or high quality stand. Over all I am 100% satisfied.",
            "PROS\n- Overall picture quality is superb\n- Color quality is spectacular\n- One Connect Box makes it extremely convenient to connect other devices\n- Speaker quality is good for a TV\n\nCONS\n- Samsung TV OS is hot garbage. Has very few apps which are not updated. E.g. Disney+ Hotstar app was last updated 2 years ago and doesn't support 4k playback. Investing in a chromecast or fire stick might be mandatory.\n- Sound is good for a TV. But didn't come close to matching picture quality. If you spend this much for a TV, might as well get a home theater system.",

Though the installation person had no clue and was poorly trained with the help of YouTube videos and after initially putting the nails in wrong places in the wall, got it right in the 2nd attempt.

            "This is an excellent television in this price range. The sound output is great, however if you are going with the 50 inch version, it has only 20 watt output which is decent for a room, but might need a soundbar for a hall.\n\nThe blacks are good but not as deep as an OLED. However, in the price range, you wouldn't get any better.\n\nColour contrast is amazing with the QLED tech for the television.\n\nBeing the Frame, with no gap wallmount and art mode, it's actually a cherry on the cake.\n\nI would suggest to go ahead with this without a doubt.",

And installation was done within two days of delivery and Samsung technician did the best job.",
            "Not good for gaming...\n\nI recently purchased this tv 55 inch a month back. I have both xbox one x and PS4 pro. This tv is showing bright area in the lower section (around 3 inches) horizontally in dark grey background scenes, or dark scenes.if you are a gamer, you will definitely not find the great picture uniformity in terms of dark color areas in gaming mode. Switching off gaming mode will result in lag to the input signal very much, still you will notice this bright area at bottom. This is very dissapointing as my old sony full HD tv was having way better clarity.",
            "We had recently got the Q70T QLED model and this one has better sound than that model but for some reason the OS is little laggy, takes time to load once you power on and lags for a good 1-2 mins before it goes to being smooth again. The wall mount is beautiful, colors are vibrant and sharp and the viewing angles are also great. Except for the lag issue, it's definitely bang for the buck.",
            "Awsome tv from samsung. Samsung known as his display and this is the beast of qled panel. .sound is also very loud. 40 watt speaker great sound quality. Right now in market not even single companies provide qled tv in this range.",

Period.\n\nThe 2020 edition of Samsung The Frame TV comes with even more features than its Predecessor (The Frame 2019).\n\nPicture Quality\n1. Both in HDR and SDR Content).\n\nSound Quality\n1. 40w Output but will be more than sufficient for most of us).\n\nConnectivity\n1.

            "This tv doesn't have local dimming and Dolby vision support but the image quality is still not bad as it has hdr10 and hdr10+ support. HDR on this tv isn't as punchy as on oneplus qled q1 series tvs since they have local dimming.\n\nAudio in this tv is truly feels like next level and better than any other TV in this price range. Because oneplus lacks in after sales support, I recommend you buy this one instead. My under warranty oneplus tv is dead since last two months and nobody came to repair it yet even after raising multiple complaints to their senior department.\n\nSo if you want best-in-class picture quality without any after sales support then go for oneplus qled otherwise purchase this one.\nFun fact : oneplus's qled panel is also made by samsung.\n\nTizenTvOs over AndroidTV os is a serious downgrade. So I bought mi TV box 4K for Android app support that you can see in the attached picture.",

We keep calling flipkart but not proper response on their side. Very bad customer service.\nLooks like flipkart is good for small orders but can't handle big ticket items....go for other sellers if option available",

            "You have to see it to believe it. Such deep blacks and amazing contrast. Loving it.\nGo for it. Worth the premium over oneplus or mi.\n\nArt mode is pretty cumbersome, uploading pictures and choosing mats, they don't work most of the times. Anyway I got this as a TV and it's awesome that way.",
            "After a long time I returned to samsung & its totally worth it. Picture quality is just awesome. No one can beat samsung on picture quality. It's a VA panel so side viewing is not that great like sony or LG but if you are watching TV in font of you there is no issue of color fading. Now about One connect box connection it's a superb innovative idea by samsung. No more ugly wires hanging from wall. I have my power point at top so only power cable are visible but anyone can hide it if power point is bellow of the tv. Basically no wires & true frame concept. I purchased it for my playstation console & gaming on this TV is just wow. Just thinking if ps4 show that awesome picture what Ps5 can do. Waiting for it though. Only thing I didn't like is sound quality. It's just average.no punchy sound. But that was also covered as I connected my 2.1 stereo system with it. Please be sure you do have optical or arc connection available on your sound system because aux not supported.\nOverall am very happy with my purchase.Thank you Flipkart for delivery before the promise date. Though Flipkart arrange third party installation for the tv which I don't like,so Samsung customer care arrange their service person & it get installed within the same day it delivered. That's a benefit when purchase something from a brand. Thanks Samsung & Flipkart.",
            "With 4k crispy resolution and good black levels it serves most people's needs quite well. (Of course not OLED level black levels but quite good)\nAt this price point however, it can be a tough sell for some if they view it in person.\nNot to say that it is bad or anything, it is decent for this price but you can probly. get a regular QLED and just be fine if you don't want the art mode per say.\n\nThe art mode, I would rate it 7 of 10.\nWhat ruins it for me is that you can't get the white bezels for it in India and it ruins the immersion for it.\nAs it has black bezels and when it is on it juts seems like some buffed up and brighter version of the original paper version of the art piece. Its OK, but could have been a lot better if we could have custom bezels for it in India. It would be so much better.\n\nVerdict:-\n1. Excellent TV\n2. Good panel\n3. Art mode might be a gimmick for some\n4. Price a tad bit higher\n5. Custom bezels would have been nice",
            "Perfect TV at this price! Really a great value for money. The QLED screen looks great! The upscaling is very good!\nSoftware is smooth and fast. Art mode works great. Ambient mode is good too!\nThe tune station mode is a good addition to have.\nOverall, a great TV. I have the 50 inch variant and is very good overall.",

            "Awesome picture quality, with 120Hz the viewing experience is much superior to regular 4K TVs. Sound output is really good as well. The TV comes with a connector box, all inputs go into it, and only an optical cable from the box connects to the atV, this reduces the clutter a lot. The art concept is good, but one needs to subscribe to it for wide options, only 2 paintings come as free. Highly recommended for those who have a keen eye for picture quality.",
            "Awesome TV .... Is frame worth the hype? ... yes it is.\nIts an awesome television with superb picture quality... HDR content looks crazy on this panel and if like me you watch Netflix and Prime mostly ... the display gives awesome picture quality. Just need a fast internet connection and boom you will love watching all your favorite content. The 40W speakers are surprisingly good and give a loud output .... all in all a great purchase ... thank you team Flipkart for giving a great deal and team Samsung thank you for creating such a cool display",

            "Firstly it isn't just a TV , it's a piece of art serving as a decor for your room and enhancing it's overall appeal.The picture quality is QLed so nothing more to say and moreover from best screen brand in the world Samsung.Picture quality is too good.Next sound is also amazing as it has 40W speakers which produce pretty good bass as well as overall sound is also very crisp and clear.The connectivity feature through the Samsung smart things app is very good and you get to control everything in the TV from the app.I think it's also value for money consider ing it's QLed and the features it provides.Also it's future proof as it has 120Hz display and Hdmi 2.1.The setup is so clean that if you put it neatly it doesn't feel like a tv setup but looks like a frame completely with which you can have a new painting or masterart everyday.The processor is also good in this so you don't feel the lag anytime.If you have this budget and searching for a more than tv thing ,this is the best you can get from a such reputed brand.",
            "Writing this review after more than 10 days of usage. I bought this TV after a long research, but really resulted into a big success. This TV is a real value for money. Everything is perfect. I like the panel design with a concept of zero gap wall mount and art mode. The picture quality is amazing. I am using JBL sound bar connected through ARC mode which gives true punchy bass with great sound quality. Overall happy with the purchase. I bought it during TV days sale on Flipcart selling my old Samsung 43 basic TV on OLX.\nHighly recommended. You won't be disappointed.",

Color reproduction is fantastic but would say it's not the best since I could see in a few situation where I could see the lines between two shades but is very minimal.

It doesn\u2019t. What I was told, which sounds weird- every time I have to mirror content from my phone, I have to enable hotspot on my phone (so I lose home WiFi network speed), then screen mirror the content.

They did not know the mount system for this TV, three people just tried to watch youtube videos, read manual and call someone to get help.

The TV comes with a connector box, all inputs go into it, and only an optical cable from the box connects to the atV, this reduces the clutter a lot. The art concept is good, but one needs to subscribe to it for wide options, only 2 paintings come as free. Highly recommended for those who have a keen eye for picture quality.",

I mean a VA panel that too Edge Lit. That says something. Almost OLED level blacks (Pretty\nClose).\n4 - Sound. The sound is just great. Not a soundbar or a Home theater level great. But great given that its coming from a TV speaker.\n5 - Picture Quality is good too.\n6 - Brightness. Man does it light up the whole room.\n\nCons-\n1 - The processor is a bit sluggish at times.\n2 - App support is a bit thin.\n3 - It has a VA Panel so the Viewing angles are not that great. Black becomes grey and almost white as you move to an extreme angle.\n4 - It should have come with Google assistant built in but instead they went with BIXBY (Bad). It supports Alexa so a bit of a relief there.",

The only draw back is the tizen os. Not really a draw back but they have a lot to work on. Not all apps that you want is available and don't know why Netflix is not working, tried logging in but couldn't. Just go for it, you will not regret.\nThis review is after using it for a month",
            "I liked the frame design and picture quality. I am very happy with the purchase. TV is bulky and no bezel available in India. Do we know when will it be available?",

            "The Product is Amazing, Picture Quality and Sound System is Simply Outstanding\u0964\n\nBut, The Main Negative Side Of This TV is, The Mic is Not Working Properly in Remote, It is Not able to detect the correct Voice, Bixby is the worst assistant in it,",
            "Great picture quality. Speakers are perfect",
            "Got it at 73k with exchange of an old 32 lcd, great buy 55\" frame.\n\nColors are fabulous on this frame.\n\nShould use with a sound bar for best experience.\n\nVery smart look.",
            "TV is very good. Value for money but the picture quality is sometimes very poor. I don't know whether it's my DTH problem or Tv problem and sometimes I faced the issue while connecting my laptop. Overall good TV.",
            "Always wanted the Frame TV since it\u2019s launch because of few important factors like QLED panel, 120 refresh rate, OneConnect box, HDR, 40W sound etc. customizable bezel is much awaited however will be available in India hopefully soon.",

            "A rather very good tv at this price!! Very good HD picture quality at the same time it enhances SD transmission for better viewing !! With refresh rate of 120 Hz and 40 W Sound output makes it worth buying !!\nHowever it shows 2017 model i receive and not 2020 as said !! Nothing is free or pre loaded except few apps not even art pictures to display on frame tv !!! Have to purchase from store !!\nBrought just 8 days back need more to explore !!!",
            "TV is good. Colors are vibrant. Liked the interface very much.",
            "2 week used and happy, but bezels are needed to give that unique view of the frame, performance is good overall\nSound sensors not adjust sound properly with noise\nSound incresed or decreased irregularly,\nHelp me on this omni sales",
            "Its simply beyond my imagination. I had read up about the game changing leap of the QLED screen , but its one thing to read and another to see it.\nTHE FRAME is aptly named. in our small room, on our small wall a huge 50 inch TV would have have eaten up the space. but not this one, as it fits on with very little gap to the wall. Then the unique pleasure of seeing a beautiful screen saver , if i may, instead of a black blank screen when the TV is switched off.\nTrue the volume is not too high , nor the sound quality any good, For just vocals it is very good. But then , to me, it is a visuals which is the number 1 criteria, and one can get a sound bar to get the acoustic delight. Very few slim LCD TVs can provide the speaker of any quality , to go with the brilliant visuals.\nWhat is most , most, commendable is the ease of the full deal. I order on line at 9 pm. Next norming the tv is delivered at 12.30 am. Old TV exchange ( hassle free on the spot) , and the very next day, the installation professional completes the job. TREMENDOUS LOGISTICS FLIPKAR. ( i am in Mumbai and in a covid free zone )\nWhat is short of my expectation here ? Well I had understood that the ART gallery would be complimentary for a three month period .. but i don't see it.\nWHAT MORE i COULD WISH FOR.. well I wish I had a larger room to get the 55 or larger screen size....",

            "Such a vivid picture quality and sound. Worth for money",
            "You will fall in love with the Art and Ambient mode. It's more than setting just a wallpaper on the tv. It's a whole experience",
            "Amazing sound and picture quality....go for it.\nInstallation is also fast no problems.\nEveryone is saying that very good looking tv.\nIf your budget is 80000 than don't think and buy this 55 inch Samsung FRAME .\nYou will be not disappointed.",
            "Installation and demo by samsung technicians was smooth.\nBetter to keep a small drilling machine ready for wall mounting and cable pass-through.\n\nAwesome TV.",
            "As of now satisfied with product will share more after 6 mnth use. Only con regarding this is their is no option to watch cameras attached to alexa and Sometimes iphone screen wont air play easily . Use it with mac and iphone 11 pro /7 pro / and iphone 8 . issue connecting if 11 pro connected first. Sound quality good. Aesthetically best looking art piece in living area.",

            "It is a nice TV meet up our requirements But The Installation Was very Bad The installer said that TV is Installed but he has not installed the TV That's whyi am giving it 3 star",

            "Worth every \u20b9\u20b9\u20b9\u20b9\u20b9\u20b9\u20b9\u20b9......\n\nPicture quality mind blowing : Q Technology\nSound is better\n\nMust Buy.....",
            "The TV is awesome. I used the roataion mount which is 1.5 to 2 inch apart from the wall because had internet wires and all coming from behind the television. Picture quality is also as good as any qled TV and a beautiful design",
            "I got this TV for 57k during the October BBD sale. I think paying anything more than 60k is definitely not worth it because there are much better options in the market from Sony & LG.\n\nPicture Quality: It's quite good actually but in extremely high and low lighting conditions it fails to deliver the best picture clarity. Like watching a dark scenes of a horror movie at night or watching test cricket under bright sunlight you might have some occasional issues with picture clarity.\n\nSound Quality: It's decent for a mid sized room, it's clear and loud enough. But if you are looking for theater like experience then you definitely need additional soundbars.\n\nConnectivity: In this aspect the TV stands out because everytime you want to connect your PS4 or laptop or Pendrive etc you don't have to search for ports behind the dusty & cobweb laden areas of a regular TV. The ports are right behind the One Connect Box.\n\nCons: There is one big issue which you must remember. There is one optic fibre cable running from the TV to One Connect Box and the cost of this cable is 7-8k. Incidentally this cable breaks easily, a simple act of pushing/pulling the One Connect Box can damage the cable and you end up shelling out 7-8k not to mention that this part doesn't come under warranty & Samsung dealers never keep it in stock. So if you happen to break it unintentionally be prepared to wait for 10-15 days at least, since this is a unique wire which can not be brought through off market route either.\n\nVerdict: Buy this TV for the Art mode feature for which you need to pay 3k per year atleast to get access to the high quality art gallery. If you don't mind paying then go ahead with this TV.\nFYI: If you are an Art fan then this TV will surprise you with art works of every known artist of the world starting from Leonardo Da Vinci to Vince Van Gogh. You will need a high speed Internet connection to be able to use this Art mode feature.",
            "Excellent... Deep blacks, super bright, superior colours and great sound. It is more than my expectations... Film makers mode is superb. You can't get better tv like this @75K.",
            "Just bought this tv after waiting for it for 3 months and super happy with it. The picture quality is amazing. Very clear and awsome colors. The sound is very crisp and clear.",
            "Its an excellent TV in terms of everything. Picture quality is excellent. UI is smooth. It does have a relatively weak wireless receptor but doesn't hamper the overall experience. It also needs a little bit tweaking over the default settings for the best frame rate upscaling results. But it more than makes up for everything by the premium look it adds to a living space.",
            "Best in class and incomparable with other brand with same feature but connectivity is poor can mirror iPhone only",
            "An excellent tv ,but with sound output of 40watt, there is something grossly missing. Up to level 10 it is hardly audiable. With people talking in room with simultanious tv ON, the volume needs to be at around 45.\nThe person who came to demonstrate, did not even explained to switch to TV mode. As per him the QLED tv is for homes having 100 mbps broadband connection. I had to navigate to & search many buttons to watch news inspite of having D2H connection. He did not explain how to use ambiant mode. He said Things app is useful only when 100 mbps broadband connection is available. So he did not explain anything. I will need plenty of time to read manual to find out what all benefits this QLED & smart tv has. Presently without 100 mbps connection it looks like a waste of investment, but needs to explore to more to get 100 % benefit without broadband connection.\nSecondly I was not explained about extended warrenty I had purchased for more than Rs 6000 /- I am not sure about mobile number of this company or any other firm for warrenty issues in future.\nMy apologies for harsh words, but possibly a good person who can explain about smart tv usage may bring chears on faces of customers for having spent a lot on TVs.",

Also discovery plus is not accessible on TV.\n\nWorst part is that installation guy called me after 5 days to install TV. This situation stands in Pune. If this is Flipkart service , it's totally pathetic",

            "It's an excellent TV with amazing picture quality and decent sound. All family/friends who saw were impressed by the concept. I bought in June 2020 and then again for a family in October.\n\nPicture: 9.5/10 - Needs some fine tuning for better experience. default is too bright and colors are not so natural. Movie Maker Mode was added recently via update, but it becomes too dim in daytime and hard to watch. I am using movie mode with slight customization for more natural picture. There were visible judders when there were fast moving scenes initially with the default settings. With some tuning they have become negligible. Dolby Vision is not supported by Samsung .This maybe a limitation with some people, but I dont have problem in this regard. HDR10, HDR10+, HLG are supported and shouldn't be too much difference wrt Dolby Vision as the content at the moment is limited. Maybe in a few years it may catch up, but I am not too bothered.\n\nSound: 7.5/10 - Its decent loud and little bass is there, but not enough to justify the movie watching experience this TV can provide with the Picture. Have added Samsung Q60T soundbar and now its much better. The bass from the soundbar provides the thump we get in theater for watching movies. Samsung supports Dolby Digital Plus on the Frame TV and Dolby Atmos via HDMI passthrough and does not support DTS codecs. Its own soundbar Q60T has DTS-X support which is weird.\n\nSoftware: 6/10 -\nON TV:\nWhile it provides most commonly used apps, also its Netflix certified so Netflix opens instantly, the apps dont get the update as frequently as android. Like Hostar added many 4K titles on android, but Samsung dint initially (not sure if they are added now as I uninstalled) Since its not android, cant side load any app as well. I have added FireTV 4k stick. I unsinstalled all removable apps from the TV and installed all required apps on FireTV stick. The TV remote can manage most functions of the FireTV stick remote, so it's easily manageable.\n\nOn Smartthings app:\nThough they advertise LIVE streaming on the app from the TV or streaming sound from TV to app, I don't see the options. I can only use the multiview or cast from youtube etc. I reset the TV and reinstalled the app many times. If could just get the sound on my phone, I could use my headphones without disturbing others at night. I dont want to spend on bluetooth headphones as I have many wired ones which would go to waster otherwise.\n\nFeatures: 100/10: the art mode is its USP and no other TV can beat this. My trial period is over and 299/month is expensive. free mode only give 20 basic artwork which one will get bored quite easily. I have upload some custom artwork and photos and using them now. If Samsung makes it 99/month and I will subscribe. Haven't used the ambient mode much. Connect your mobile with TV via Bluetooth and play music directly from mobile on the TV - no need to buy those cheap bluetooth speakers. No Gap Wallmount for me is a bit wobbly and there's a little gap on one side of the tv. I think is due to uneven wall surface, nothing Samsung can do about. Can be connected as a 2nd screen for computers, not much useful though for bigger screen sizes as its very difficult to work with such large screen.\n\nConnectivity 9/10: Support eARC (for soundbars) on HDMI3 and a total of 4 HDMI ports which are very generous. Can play directly from HDD/pendrive (almost all formats). Optical, RCA are also there, so most things are covered.(I am not using any DTH and using only steaming apps). Supports bluetooth speakers. TV manual says it supports Q-Symphony with supported soundbars. It dint work for me with Q60 soundbar and the customer care cant help.\n\nOthers: Remote is easy to use and well built. One Connect box simplifies the hassle of cable handling in a much better way. There are some software glitches here and there, but nothing too major. Initially there were issues with the Prime App few timeas but reinstalling from the app menu solved it.\n\nPrice: I bought for 80.5k in June 2020 with card discounts, but now it went as low as 71-72K with bump up exchange on even 24 inch TV during sales. ( I really could use the offer if it was available). If you have/can arrange for a small working TV, the bump up discount is additional savings.",

My room has lot of light so the QLED is most suitable for any lights than OLED.\n\nBlacks are good not great like OLED, but manageable.\n\nSound is great but you may need external soundbar for great cinematic experience.\n\nOverall very happy with the product and also thanks flipkart for this great deal.",

            "Picture quality is good. Art mode is good but bit overhyped, ambience mode is more interesting. Good sound and interface.\n\nOnly disappointing thing about this TV is Viewing angle, seriously it's bad colors fade at over 20\u00b0, even in art mode with lighter coloured pictures all you see is white screen.\nPurchase it only if you are adamant about not wanting black screen on your wall when TV is off and going to watch TV sitting directly infront of tv.",

Excellent display and appearance that goes well with my interior. Excellent picture quality and bang for buck at this price. Even the regular content is nicely upscaled. Only issue is fast motion blur which could be corrected in settings but couldn't find the right settings",
            "Picture quality is amazing especially after moving on from a 10 year old Full HD LED Samsung TV.\nSound quality is also good the only gripe would be that voice assistant does not work good alteast from Alexa perspective. Will try Bixby in the coming days.\nRest of the things are great when it comes to this TV.\n\nWill update this review after couple weeks of use.",
            "A great TV with a good set of features. Very quick delivery from Flipkart. The price is OK for what you get.\nPros:\n- outstanding picture and sound quality\n- picture frame functionality\n- design\n- \"one box\" - no visible wire clutter\n- great connectivity with Samsung phones (mirroring, etc.)\n\nCons:\n- no analog audio output\n- user manual is useless\n- smart things app for the TV on phone is complicated and is not practical\n\nMy one major gripe is that there is no 3.5mm audio out to be found anywhere for wired headphones or speakers. The \"one box\" is a great concept, they could have easily fit one more small plug on it... The only way around to get analog audio out of the the the HDMI interface by a HDMI audio extractor unit (2000Rs+) or through the optical output which only works with 5.1 content.",
            "TV was delivered on the day as mentioned. Picture & sound quality is perfect.",

            "Very good picture quality in bright surrounding with vibrant colours, but you can notice that the blacks are not as good in dark surroundings. You would wish that you had a oled tv. Also viewing angles are not that good.\nThe upscaling and video processing is not that good as well, specially for SD content. There is lot of judder if you turn on the high frame rate feature (Clear motion).\nSound is ok. Anyways can't expect much from 40W speakers. The active voice amplifier feature seems gimmicky.\nDesign wise it looks great. No gap wall mount and the single translucent wire connecting the tv to the one connect box are very good features that you can show off. Although, the art mode is that realistic.\nI bought this TV only because I wanted a QLED TV and with Samsung being the inventor of this technology and this TV being their cheapest offering. If the same is applicable for you then go for it else. Don't buy it for the Art mode or high refresh rate.",
