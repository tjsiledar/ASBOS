            "Very much satisfied with this purchase. Purchased on Dussera festival and using it since last 3 weeks. My rating 4.5/5....\n\nPicture Quality: Excellent for 4K and HD videos.\nNot at all great for SD channels. You have to have HD set top box to enjoy picture quality. Other than SET TOP box, Netflix, Hotstar, YouTube(1080p and above resolutions) looks awesome on this TV.\n\nCons: There is automatic upgrade of picture quality for SD channels or Any online videos less than 720p....I feel that VU is good in that case.\nSometimes I feel that 60Hz motion rate is less and can see lags in picture....but this is intermittent and not for all videos.\n\nSound Quality:\n4.5/5 for sound quality....I have 5 in 1 Sound System, but sound quality of this TV is so good that I just don't feel to connect it.\n\nSmart? Definitely smart TV with all required apps on TV. You can also download any app from Goigle Play Store. Internet and Bluetooth connectivity is very good.\nAir Mouse works flawlessly....I was little worried about its functionality before purchasing, but my 7 year old son too can browse or type easily with this remote air mouse.\nChromecast is inbuilt and works seamlessly.\n\nI don't know how long it will go, but so far it is looking great. Even if this TV works great for next 5-7 years it is value fo money. Instead of spending 1lacs + for branded (Sony, Samsung) TV, this is far better deal. Choice is yours anyways.\n\nNote: If you are looking for review on anything specific thing, let me know in reply and I can update it for you.",
            "Good service by Flipkart.\nDelivery on time.\nnow come to facts about tv.\n\npros:\n1) build design is good and finish\n2) Android tv with playstore\n3)Sound quality is good\n4)auto brightness\n5)Smart remote included which supports air mouse good feature\n6)you can play high end game like asphalt 8\n\ncons:\n1) less than 1080p video will not be justified by tv as the video seems blurr but 4k videos are awsum to watch\n2) sometimes air mouse hangs and scrolling is not dat great.\n3) You will not found all the apps in playstore as not supported.\n4) Browser is not included like Chrome, Firefox etc. even can't find on playstore but might be sideloaded\n5) some sideloaded apps have orientation problems.",
            "Best TV buying decision ever. Feeling lucky to have miss the MI TV flash sales. Coming to the TV\n\nPROS\nTV looks stunning in Silver Metal finish.\n4K & HDR content is amazing to watch, 720p and 1080p is good if viewed from certain distance (>10ft), kindly avoid SD content.\nViewing angles are great (VA panel), Backlight dimming and Black levels are superb, considering the price.\n4K in YouTube (Slight here and there framedrops in 2160p 60fps quality) and HDR in Netflix is a delight to watch.\nHDR10 mode run flawlessly in Windows 10.\nAudio quality is great on Music preset mode and wall mounted position.\nReads almost every File type from USB and HDD without a hitch. (120Mbps tested)\nAudio only mode for music listening is a delight for me.\n10 GB internal storage available for APP installation and storage\nAPK can be sideloaded without any problem (Just use sideload launcher to see the apps in Home screen)\nOfficial Android, Google Chromecast(mirroring) and Assistant(needs work) support are an added benefit.\nNo serious audio lag on Bluetooth. (With my Logitech adapter)\nI haven't tested heavy games, but installed Beach buggy and it runs smoothly, am sure others games too.\nPower consumption <100W (Backlight Level@64), and audio only mode <30W.\nCompatibility with keyboard and mouse (Tested), Gamepad (Not tested)\nFree wall mounting.\n\nCONS\nVoice recognition is still fuzzy through smart remote.\n4k Upscaling is mediocre even from high quality 1080p content.\nDTH HD channels are OK to watch.\nAmazon prime is not supporting natively.\nBack side ports are tough to reach after wall mounting.(ofcourse expected)\nAndroid TV playstore has limited app support. (Not a TV con though)\nDolby TRUEHD audio codecs are not fully supported.\n\nOther thoughts\nShould add delayed confirmation upon power off switch through remote.\nSafely remove storage shortcut will be a nice option to add.\nOTA for android and remote voice search is expected soon.\nAuto power OFF option (<1hr preferred) would be great to have.\nFlash sales are tricky (COD option has better chances)\n3 USB ports and Panel reflection should improved slightly on next model.\n\nThanks FLIPKART for providing and Jeeves for installing this awesome TV for me.\nHighly RECOMMENDED for everyone out there with a 50K budget looking for a 55\" 4K HDR TV experience.",
            "I have bought this TV during Independence Day flash sales, after repeated failed attempts in the past. It has been two weeks since I am using this product and will share my experiences so that you can have better idea about the product before any investment. The TV set was delivered on time but it took 1 week time to get it installed by the technician, hence my first hand experience was very bad with the flipkart technicians. Moving onwards after installation the TV work exceptionally well, the major USPs are its picture quality and off course sound, sound is sufficient enough that you don't need any extra speakers with the TV set. If you are buying a Smart TV then the net connectivity becomes an important parameter and trust me this TV has exceptional connectivity. I am not using any set box, I simply use my mobile handset's hotspot for Internet access and I enjoys all the online contents of YouTube, Netflix and other apps seamlessly. For 4K videos you must have better Internet connectivity (I 've already registered for Jio Fibre plan, after getting same I'll be able to enjoy 4K conte ts as well.). This is a must buy product which has unique features as: 1. Highly Competitive Price Range 2. Google certified android (Which not there in its competitors, especially Mi TV) 3. Better Specification than Mi TV 4. Excellant picture quality 5. Crisp clear sound feature which dies not requires additional speakers 6. Tge build and design is sturdy yet very slim. Like every products it has some cons too like 1. Installation service was below satisfactory, I can't generalise this thing but it was my experience. Rest all are excellent, I feel like rate it as 4 star just because of its post sales services but the more features of this TV compelled me to give 5 star. I hope this would be helpful for you.",
            "tv works good. fully android tv. user interface is good. i purchased MI TV 4 on first sale in feb and now i purchased IFFALCIN TV. campared to both we can say MI TV 4 is not at all android it runs on patchwall os , before purchasing i imagined lot about mi tv 4. but after my 4 months experience mi tv is not good for people who want to be tech edicted. when we came to IFFALCON its completely android certified. can install directly apps from good play store and no need to use third party installation apps. yes its 4k is really good. and more over its google voice assistant is awesome reduces typing time. i sugges you to go with extended warrenty offered by flipkart partner jeevas.",
            "I should probably tell you that I am also one of those disgruntled members of the mi tv4 club. Its samsung panel was very tempting, though i later realized (thankfully) that it was bottom lit with no local dimming. The obvious other choice was Vu. It had full array backlight and its contrast and colors were well reviewed. Then came this beast, with its perfect spec sheet of android, air mouse and micro-dimming. Immediately, missing out on the mi seemed a blessing in disguise.\n\nAbout the Tv now... its well-built with a solid frame and a panel that doesn't seem to be much reflective. Full points there. The design though, is not something that impresses.\nSwitching on takes some time and since i had my DTH connected, it went straight to it. SD channels look OK for a 55' tv. HD channels look very good with ample sharpness and upscaling. Color reproduction is my only concern as it is nowhere near my 32' Lg 3d tv that is 6 years old. Even when set for \"cold\" temp setting, the colors appear warm, especially the whites. That said, local dimming and motion rates are good.\n\nDTH apart, moving on to web content (downloaded movies and videos, both 10bit 1080p and 4k HDR10 content).\nSettings: color 70, contrast 70, sharpness 70, brightness 60.\nStarting with The Grand Tour and Logan in 10bit 1080p, even when played in 16:9 full screen, the sharpness was excellent (could see every hair in Logan's beard), colors really good and nice contrast. Moving on to 4k..videos in YouTube do not seem to support HDR, but the sample videos from samsung and lg looked just awesome with punchy colors and responsive local dimming for a great contrast. But it is in 4k HDR videos is where i got truly blown off. Tried the Blade Runner (4k HDR BT2020 DTS, atmos) and it played without breaking a sweat. Oh the colors!..i dont have the words to describe them, having used excellent and awesome already :P...the details in the sky, gold colored walls, lit areas in dark backgrounds all seemed truly HDR.\n\nSound: In spite of ppl saying that the sound is not that good, i find that the surround sound aspect of the speakers is really good. While watching IPL and Football, the stadium effect was... real. Volume is quite loud and there is a hint of bass. It really gives a big speaker kind of effect, especially in voice sequences, which can take some time to get used to. Dolby atmos seems to work or was it DTS track that was rendered in the Blade Runner movie I am not sure, but the quality was awesome.\n\nHaven't tried out the Android part of the Tv much. The UI is OK and quiet easy to use. For accessing USB, had to go to settings which is irritating.\n\nBoth the remotes are suspiciously heavy, ooze quality and work well (air mouse too).\n\nTo realize the full potential of the Tv, watch it from a good distance, preferably > 10 feet.",
            "The product was beyond expectations ...\n1) YouTube videos - 4k\n2) Hotstar - 4k and awesome contrast\n3) DTS is mind blowing\n4)USB- fast rendering and UHD\n5)Google certified is seemingly comfortable\n6) Good adaptation to colors\n7)DTH HD clarity is ok compared to Hotstar videos and YouTube\n8) Dolby support is awesome with Hometheatre.\noverall worth 5 rating and is far beyond Mi TV (according to reviews)\n9) Renders 61gb size Imax HDR10 without any lag even i7 8gb laptop fails to play smoothly",
            "One of the best purchase in flipkart by me..It truely deserves 5/5 for every penny i have paid. I brought this in first sale only on 7th may 2018..delivered on 11th may, Demo and installation done on 12th may by jeeves. I have done tabletop installation. Wallmounting i can do anytime with jeevesas i want which is due, a good feature. As it is VA panel with 10 bit HDR , the pictures in this looks vibrant and gorgeous. Just download a hdr 10 bit video sample from 4kmedia.org and see it by yourself , its far far better than a non hdr simple 4k videos...love it. Full hd channel 1080i by dish tv had very good display in this tv. Sd channel are not good once you have seen the hdr videos. Black looks almost perfect black as a result whites and brighter contents looks excellent and evolving. No led bleeding observed, though it is edgelit . As it is va pan viewing angles are not that great ,brightness shift seen beyoud 90* degrees its major con but who sees such tv at mor than this angle.But in one line brightness and vividness is awesome . Audio is awesome with dolby and dts speaker .Its loud and clear with some bass effect. I have rarely used volume beyond 50 range . I use sony HTIV 300 home theatre...oh boy its awesome.....and mindblowing..I use toslink cable brought from amazon...its crystal cear 5.1 audio from dth hd channel audio which has dolby support. The HDMI ARC is also working fine..but sometine on switching channels audio goes out may be fault of supplied cable by dth. But now it is not having such case.. Let me try new hdmi cable i orderd from amazon....connectivuty wise it has every port that too in sufficient and approachable ..... Suppled power cord attached to tv is ok okay type but 2 pin good quality. Look wise tv is also gool as like tcl tv signature with sturdy aluminium stand..Its metallic bezel is good looking .Its slim also...with good ventilation on back.Usb 3.0 is very good...also supporting 2 tb seagate hdd. Usually inbuilt palyer support almost all codec. As it is smart tv...with 7.0 google certified youu tube 720p onwards video are awesome. Mirror casring using t. ast applicatin is very nice...but initially it was not working..but now with minimal delay it was working very nice. Bluetooth teethering with home theatre is good. Good connectivity with internet via wify..no disconnection. But google pay store has no much apps...not even chrome...Its not good.Asphalt 8 was very nice with no lag. Usb 2.0 is also working good. I had added jeeves extender warrrnty of 2 years after purchase for Rs. 3570 from its website as it was not showing while purcahse in first sale...Tension free 2 years extra after manufacturer warrenty......Overall a very good purchase for Rs 45999....Satisfied with both auio and video performance...Ideal viewing dustance is 10- 12 feet is. very good. Hope tcl will have good swrvice if anything goes wrong...hope it will be avery good purchase. Thanks flipkart and Omnitech retail.Thank you.",
            "WARNING: This is going to be a long and detailed review, so please prepare yourselves.\n\nExperience from Flipkart and Jeeves: (3.5/5)\nI ordered the TV on 10th July and. received it on 15th July, was kind of disappointed because everyone in reviews claimed that they received it the next day of ordering, but anyways. It was installed on 16th July (the next day after delivery). Installation guy from jeeves was nice, and he installed it perfectly and very quickly(even installed a photo frame and a settop box stand on asking him for free).\n\nPicture Quality: (5/5)\nPicture quality is really really nice. The colours are very balanced and punchy, looks natural and pleasing, unlike some TV's which are too much oversaturated or dull. Sharpness is very balanced as well and even 720p content looks great.\n4K content looks amazing, I played some 4K HDR demo videos amd they were crisp, a lot of details could be seen. I also played Blade Runner 2049 4K HDR movie (it was a whooping 75GB+) and it looked stunning. Dark scenes look amazing, blacks are very deep and we can see details in shadows and dark areas too. YouTube 4K looks great aswell and Netflix 4K also looks wonderful. Settop Box HD content looks beautiful as well (not as good as 4k, but if you watch it from a distance of 7-8 feet+, even settop box HD channels will look good. SD content on the other hand looks a little bad when you compare it with the HD and 4K, but it still looks watchable amd is not really a problem if you watch it from 8 feet+ distance. Compared to other TVs the SD content looks better on this due to the picture upscaling present on this. HDR10 is great as well.\nOverall this TV's picture quality can be compared to any Samsung, Sony or LG 4K TV under 1.5 lakh.\n\nSound: (4.5/5)\nIt has got 2 speakers with total output of 16 watts which might not sound like a lot on paper, but in reality it is more than sufficient even for a medium sized hall. Speaker is very loud and delivers clear audio. It even has hints of bass in it, which makes the speakers sound really rich, and not tinny. With my settop box at maximum volume, on the TV a volume between 20-30 units is loud enough for casual viewing, though I will still not recommend using this TV without external speakers and a subwoofer if you watch movies. For regular TV series, sports and news, speakers are more than enough.\n\nAndroid OS: (4/5)\nAndroid TV on this price range is just incredible. The Android TV interface is smooth and fluid for most of the time except for sometimes when you press home button from some heavy apps, it takes a little time to respond. I installed apps like Terrarium TV, Freeflix HQ, KODI with addons, JioTV and JioCinema on it. All of them work like a charm. They will provode you a lot of content. Overall experience is good but apps in playstore are limited (due to less apps for Android TV) and it kind of lags when opening or closing apps. Chromecast also works like a charm, no lags no buffering and connects to the TV in a jiffy. Awesome experience with Chromecast. Screen mirroring works fine as well, though it's mot as smooth as Chromecast.\n\nSmart Remote: (4/5)\nSmart Remote is just lovely, works like a charm, is very responsive as well. Air mouse is very accurate amd responsive, buttons are click and tactile, provide you a lot of feedback. Microphone works as well, the only issue being that you have to speak a little loudly, otherwise it might not recognize what you're saying. Another problem is the button placement, the Netflix button is placed right below the back button, sometimes in dark I accidentally pressed the Netflix button instead of Back button which became very frustrating, but I guess it'll take some getting used to.\n\nDesign and Build Quality:(4.5/5)\nBuild Quality is excellent (much better than MiTV4 which is very fragile. It has a silver frame made out of brushed aluminium and not plastic which looks as well as feels great. Build Quality is noce and design looks great aswell. Table Stand and wall Mount are both of really nice quality.",

            "Very much satisfied with this purchase. Purchased on Dussera festival and using it since last 3 weeks. My rating 4.5/5....\n\nPicture Quality: Excellent for 4K and HD videos.\nNot at all great for SD channels. You have to have HD set top box to enjoy picture quality. Other than SET TOP box, Netflix, Hotstar, YouTube(1080p and above resolutions) looks awesome on this TV.\n\nCons: There is automatic upgrade of picture quality for SD channels or Any online videos less than 720p....I feel that VU is good in that case.\nSometimes I feel that 60Hz motion rate is less and can see lags in picture....but this is intermittent and not for all videos.\n\nSound Quality:\n4.5/5 for sound quality....I have 5 in 1 Sound System, but sound quality of this TV is so good that I just don't feel to connect it.\n\nSmart? Definitely smart TV with all required apps on TV. You can also download any app from Goigle Play Store. Internet and Bluetooth connectivity is very good.\nAir Mouse works flawlessly....I was little worried about its functionality before purchasing, but my 7 year old son too can browse or type easily with this remote air mouse.\nChromecast is inbuilt and works seamlessly.\n\nI don't know how long it will go, but so far it is looking great. Even if this TV works great for next 5-7 years it is value fo money. Instead of spending 1lacs + for branded (Sony, Samsung) TV, this is far better deal. Choice is yours anyways.\n\nNote: If you are looking for review on anything specific thing, let me know in reply and I can update it for you.",

            "Best TV buying decision ever. Feeling lucky to have miss the MI TV flash sales. Coming to the TV\n\nPROS\nTV looks stunning in Silver Metal finish.\n4K & HDR content is amazing to watch, 720p and 1080p is good if viewed from certain distance (>10ft), kindly avoid SD content.\nViewing angles are great (VA panel), Backlight dimming and Black levels are superb, considering the price.\n4K in YouTube (Slight here and there framedrops in 2160p 60fps quality) and HDR in Netflix is a delight to watch.\nHDR10 mode run flawlessly in Windows 10.\nAudio quality is great on Music preset mode and wall mounted position.\nReads almost every File type from USB and HDD without a hitch. (120Mbps tested)\nAudio only mode for music listening is a delight for me.\n10 GB internal storage available for APP installation and storage\nAPK can be sideloaded without any problem (Just use sideload launcher to see the apps in Home screen)\nOfficial Android, Google Chromecast(mirroring) and Assistant(needs work) support are an added benefit.\nNo serious audio lag on Bluetooth. (With my Logitech adapter)\nI haven't tested heavy games, but installed Beach buggy and it runs smoothly, am sure others games too.\nPower consumption <100W (Backlight Level@64), and audio only mode <30W.\nCompatibility with keyboard and mouse (Tested), Gamepad (Not tested)\nFree wall mounting.\n\nCONS\nVoice recognition is still fuzzy through smart remote.\n4k Upscaling is mediocre even from high quality 1080p content.\nDTH HD channels are OK to watch.\nAmazon prime is not supporting natively.\nBack side ports are tough to reach after wall mounting.(ofcourse expected)\nAndroid TV playstore has limited app support. (Not a TV con though)\nDolby TRUEHD audio codecs are not fully supported.\n\nOther thoughts\nShould add delayed confirmation upon power off switch through remote.\nSafely remove storage shortcut will be a nice option to add.\nOTA for android and remote voice search is expected soon.\nAuto power OFF option (<1hr preferred) would be great to have.\nFlash sales are tricky (COD option has better chances)\n3 USB ports and Panel reflection should improved slightly on next model.\n\nThanks FLIPKART for providing and Jeeves for installing this awesome TV for me.\nHighly RECOMMENDED for everyone out there with a 50K budget looking for a 55\" 4K HDR TV experience.",
            "I have bought this TV during Independence Day flash sales, after repeated failed attempts in the past. It has been two weeks since I am using this product and will share my experiences so that you can have better idea about the product before any investment. The TV set was delivered on time but it took 1 week time to get it installed by the technician, hence my first hand experience was very bad with the flipkart technicians. Moving onwards after installation the TV work exceptionally well, the major USPs are its picture quality and off course sound, sound is sufficient enough that you don't need any extra speakers with the TV set. If you are buying a Smart TV then the net connectivity becomes an important parameter and trust me this TV has exceptional connectivity. I am not using any set box, I simply use my mobile handset's hotspot for Internet access and I enjoys all the online contents of YouTube, Netflix and other apps seamlessly. For 4K videos you must have better Internet connectivity (I 've already registered for Jio Fibre plan, after getting same I'll be able to enjoy 4K conte ts as well.). This is a must buy product which has unique features as: 1. Highly Competitive Price Range 2. Google certified android (Which not there in its competitors, especially Mi TV) 3. Better Specification than Mi TV 4. Excellant picture quality 5. Crisp clear sound feature which dies not requires additional speakers 6. Tge build and design is sturdy yet very slim. Like every products it has some cons too like 1. Installation service was below satisfactory, I can't generalise this thing but it was my experience. Rest all are excellent, I feel like rate it as 4 star just because of its post sales services but the more features of this TV compelled me to give 5 star. I hope this would be helpful for you.",
            "tv works good. fully android tv. user interface is good. i purchased MI TV 4 on first sale in feb and now i purchased IFFALCIN TV. campared to both we can say MI TV 4 is not at all android it runs on patchwall os , before purchasing i imagined lot about mi tv 4. but after my 4 months experience mi tv is not good for people who want to be tech edicted. when we came to IFFALCON its completely android certified. can install directly apps from good play store and no need to use third party installation apps. yes its 4k is really good. and more over its google voice assistant is awesome reduces typing time. i sugges you to go with extended warrenty offered by flipkart partner jeevas.",
            "I should probably tell you that I am also one of those disgruntled members of the mi tv4 club. Its samsung panel was very tempting, though i later realized (thankfully) that it was bottom lit with no local dimming. The obvious other choice was Vu. It had full array backlight and its contrast and colors were well reviewed. Then came this beast, with its perfect spec sheet of android, air mouse and micro-dimming. Immediately, missing out on the mi seemed a blessing in disguise.\n\nAbout the Tv now... its well-built with a solid frame and a panel that doesn't seem to be much reflective. Full points there. The design though, is not something that impresses.\nSwitching on takes some time and since i had my DTH connected, it went straight to it. SD channels look OK for a 55' tv. HD channels look very good with ample sharpness and upscaling. Color reproduction is my only concern as it is nowhere near my 32' Lg 3d tv that is 6 years old. Even when set for \"cold\" temp setting, the colors appear warm, especially the whites. That said, local dimming and motion rates are good.\n\nDTH apart, moving on to web content (downloaded movies and videos, both 10bit 1080p and 4k HDR10 content).\nSettings: color 70, contrast 70, sharpness 70, brightness 60.\nStarting with The Grand Tour and Logan in 10bit 1080p, even when played in 16:9 full screen, the sharpness was excellent (could see every hair in Logan's beard), colors really good and nice contrast. Moving on to 4k..videos in YouTube do not seem to support HDR, but the sample videos from samsung and lg looked just awesome with punchy colors and responsive local dimming for a great contrast. But it is in 4k HDR videos is where i got truly blown off. Tried the Blade Runner (4k HDR BT2020 DTS, atmos) and it played without breaking a sweat. Oh the colors!..i dont have the words to describe them, having used excellent and awesome already :P...the details in the sky, gold colored walls, lit areas in dark backgrounds all seemed truly HDR.\n\nSound: In spite of ppl saying that the sound is not that good, i find that the surround sound aspect of the speakers is really good. While watching IPL and Football, the stadium effect was... real. Volume is quite loud and there is a hint of bass. It really gives a big speaker kind of effect, especially in voice sequences, which can take some time to get used to. Dolby atmos seems to work or was it DTS track that was rendered in the Blade Runner movie I am not sure, but the quality was awesome.\n\nHaven't tried out the Android part of the Tv much. The UI is OK and quiet easy to use. For accessing USB, had to go to settings which is irritating.\n\nBoth the remotes are suspiciously heavy, ooze quality and work well (air mouse too).\n\nTo realize the full potential of the Tv, watch it from a good distance, preferably > 10 feet.",
            "The product was beyond expectations ...\n1) YouTube videos - 4k\n2) Hotstar - 4k and awesome contrast\n3) DTS is mind blowing\n4)USB- fast rendering and UHD\n5)Google certified is seemingly comfortable\n6) Good adaptation to colors\n7)DTH HD clarity is ok compared to Hotstar videos and YouTube\n8) Dolby support is awesome with Hometheatre.\noverall worth 5 rating and is far beyond Mi TV (according to reviews)\n9) Renders 61gb size Imax HDR10 without any lag even i7 8gb laptop fails to play smoothly",
            "One of the best purchase in flipkart by me..It truely deserves 5/5 for every penny i have paid. I brought this in first sale only on 7th may 2018..delivered on 11th may, Demo and installation done on 12th may by jeeves. I have done tabletop installation.

Just download a hdr 10 bit video sample from 4kmedia.org and see it by you...\nREAD MORE",
            "WARNING: This is going to be a long and detailed review, so please prepare yourselves.\n\nExperience from Flipkart and Jeeves: (3.5/5)\nI ordered the TV on 10th July and. received it on 15th July, was kind of disappointed because everyone in reviews claimed that they received it the next day of ordering, but anyways. It was installed on 16th July (the next day after delivery). Installation guy from jeeves was nice, and he installed it perfectly and very quickly(even installed a photo frame and a settop box stand on asking him for free).\n\nPicture Quality: (5/5)\nPicture quality is really really nice. The colours are very balanced and punchy, looks natural and pleasing, unlike some TV's which are too much oversaturated or dull. Sharpness is very balanced as well and even 720p content looks great.\n4K content looks amazing, I played some 4K HDR demo videos amd they were crisp, a lot of details could be seen. I also played Blade Runner 2049 4K HDR movie (it was a whooping 75GB+) and it looked stunning. Dark scenes look amazing, blacks are very deep and we can see details in shadows and dark areas too. YouTube 4K looks great aswell and Netflix 4K also looks wonderful. Settop Box HD content looks beautiful as well (not as good as 4k, but if you watch it from a distance of 7-8 feet+, even settop box HD channels will look good. SD content on the other hand looks a little bad when you compare it with the HD and 4K, but it still looks watchable amd is not really a problem if you watch it from 8 feet+ distance. Compared to other TVs the SD content looks better on this due to the picture upscaling present on this. HDR10 is great as well.\nOverall this TV's picture quality can be compared to any Samsung, Sony or LG 4K TV under 1.5 lakh.\n\nSound: (4.5/5)\nIt has got 2 speakers with total output of 16 watts which might not sound like a lot on paper, but in reality it is more than sufficient even for a medium sized hall. Speaker is very loud and delivers clear audio. It even has hints of bass in it, which makes the speakers sound really rich, and not tinny. With my settop box at maximum volume, on the TV a volume between 20-30 units is loud enough for casual viewing, though I will still not recommend using this TV without external speakers and a subwoofer if you watch movies. For regular TV series, sports and news, speakers are more than enough.\n\nAndroid OS: (4/5)\nAndroid TV on this price range is just incredible. The Android TV interface is smooth and fluid for most of the time except for sometimes when you press home button from some heavy apps, it takes a little time to respond. I installed apps like Terrarium TV, Freeflix HQ, KODI with addons, JioTV and JioCinema on it. All of them work like a charm. They will provode you a lot of content. Overall experience is good but apps in playstore are limited (due to less apps for Android TV) and it kind of lags when opening or closing apps. Chromecast also works like a charm, no lags no buffering and connects to the TV in a jiffy. Awesome experience with Chromecast. Screen mirroring works fine as well, though it's mot as smooth as Chromecast.\n\nSmart Remote: (4/5)\nSmart Remote is just lovely, works like a charm, is very responsive as well. Air mouse is very accurate amd responsive, buttons are click and tactile, provide you a lot of feedback. Microphone works as well, the only issue being that you have to speak a little loudly, otherwise it might not recognize what you're saying. Another problem is the button placement, the Netflix button is placed right below the back button, sometimes in dark I accidentally pressed the Netflix button instead of Back button which became very frustrating, but I guess it'll take some getting used to.\n\nDesign and Build Quality:(4.5/5)\nBuild Quality is excellent (much better than MiTV4 which is very fragile.

The brightness level is 280 nits which according to facts is not simply enough to play HDR content at it's best, but I never felt that the picture quality on HDR video is lacking.

And this TV Installed dt- 07.04.2019, Wall mount Stand and installation Charges are free of Cost.\n\nPicture and Sound quality is good. Good Deal.",
            "Feels good that i did not go for those expensive ones. My complete experience buying the product from Flipkart was outstanding. In terms of experience rating it was 5/5. Bought the Tcl 55\" on the 10th July Sale @ 2PM, The product was delivered on 11th July at 9:15AM and the same day the installation was completed at 9:15 PM which was quite remarkable with any standards out there in the market.\n\nDelivery experience: 5/5\nInstallation experience: 5/5\n\nProduct User Experience:\nThe Tv is good, while the boot time take close to 30 sec , then again this is what you expect from even booting up your android phone which is fine. The airmouse remote works flawlessly and yes it much more convenient then the directional keys. The tv does come with a freewall mount which is of no use if you are planing to fiddle around the back of the tv for those USB, So i did put a pivotal walmount which can we moved for best viewing angles. Also took the extended guarantee for 2 more years just for my satisfaction from Jeeves who also took care on the installation end. The sound quality is good but go for a sound bar if you are having a big hall. Anyways go for this product as the closed tv - mi looks delicate and the specs on tcl looks a lot better.",
            "Good Deal for 46K. Delivery done within 24 hours and installation done in the next day morning. Coming to Technical Specifications, though it is an android Tv, most of the commonly used apps are not available in Play store, i tried side loading apps but the installed apps were not opening properly.\nand when it comes to Extended warranty, in flipkart it shows 3000 for 2 years extended warranty but the service person when he bought it online it was 3600. and coming to wall mount, though its mentioned free wall mount, it is only for normal frame mounting but, if you need flexible wall mount they charge 2500 rs. you can get the good flexible wall mount for 1500 rs. Flipkart should mention the charges for flexible wall mountinstallation and also should look after extra charges for extended warranty. Over all Tv is good. but fews bugs to be fixed. hoping for the best in the coming android update of the tv.",
            "Thanks for the Delivery of the TV in prompt time.\n\nThe TV looks excellent,picture,sound etc..everything is Awesome when we see on 4K Movies/Videos only.\nRecommend to have HD setup box then only we can enjoy the TV.\n\nInstallation guys should be trained in well manner, they don't know the complete information of the TV, just they will fit the TV on Wall/Stand and they doesn't know complete information/options of the product.\n\nTV size should be calculated diagonally(For 55 Inches), but when we see face to face of the TV it is only 49 inches, Please Make a note before buying the TV.\n\nOverall if you want to enjoy the Movies/Gaming in Big TV you can Buy without thinking......",
            "this is ultimate TV... 4K at it's best. Dolby dts sound quality amazing. various sound options. colors are so good. installation in 24 hours of delivery. everything is amazing about this TV. even support the prime app which can be downloaded from es explorer. Has t launcher which can beat MI tv patch wall. there is nothing less in this TV. No Cons and I am not sure how people finding it. it has pip picture in picture. enjoy apps while watch Dish tv channels. Has Bluetooth, Chromecast, 4 HDMI 3 USB. Many more features to go. Beating Sony Bravia and any other big brands. No need of fire stick anymore.",
            "Best option available in the market right now! Just go for it...Very much satisfied with the product!",
            "Been using the product for 2 days now. There's a few issues I have with it.\n\n1) There is no option to mirror your screen from the laptop. Even though screen mirroring is listed as a feature, I've gone through the manual and the TV but there seems to be no option for it. You can however use 3rd party apps to chromecast whatever video you're playing on your laptop so that's a positive.\n\n2) The TV boot time is pretty high compared to some of the other smart TVs out there. Takes about 30 seconds to boot, due to various loading screens.\n\n3) There's no auto brightness feature. It's advertised. But again, I don't see an option for it. I seriously don't understand why they advertise a feature but its not available.\n\n4) The installation person didn't show up on the date of supposed installation so I did it myself. Wasn't too hard, so you should be able to do it yourself, should you ever require it.\n\nThe screen itself is pretty good! The display has a tendency to display pictures on the warmer side, so if you're used to a cooler colour temperature, I'd suggest you adjust it.\n\nThe sound quality is as expected. Gets quite loud. Nothing extraordinary.\n\nHDR10 works fine too! If you have a Netflix account, you check out some of their shows such as Stranger Things, or Lost in Space which are both HDR compatible shows.",
            "Thanks to Mi flash sale, I missed to purchase Mi tv n number of times which gave me opportunity to search for alternative. But, this TV is beyond the expectations and way better than Mi tv in multiple ways.\n\nI had this tv mounted on wall and this tv gave excellent sound even on wall mounting. Audio is absolutely superb that we get to hear the sounds in dts. Coming to display, this is truly amazing. When playing 4k, 1080p and 720p this tv gave best output. When played 360p videos, the clarity is not up to the mark. Display is too good and we have customization settings both video and audio. With HDR and micro dimming functions this has enhanced the features.\nOut of two remotes provided, small one with air mouse is very easy to use and voice search is another feather.\nAs this is stock android tv, setting up google account, connecting play store and downloading apps is very easy. Not all apps which can be installed in mobile phones can be installed on this tv. Each time TV is switched on, it will have to load Android OS and it is taking around one minute to switch on to home screen.\nDelivery from Flipkart is done within one day and on the same day Jeeves completed installation.\nWith wall mounting, there is a chance that two HDMI ports provided on the back side can become useless and would have better if all ports are on the side instead of back side.\n\nOverall, it is great competition for Mi TV and best alternative with just one thousand rupees extra. Great budget friendly TV with full value for money.",
            "The product is really the best it's better than LG and Samsung TV. Also the handling features of TV are very smart . I personally love this TV. And service is also nice you get free delivery and installation. It is very good product in best price . The picture quality is really impressive.",
            "excellent picture quality mind blowing, before update there were many software issues after updating to Oreo performance is top notch and picture quality has improved like anything kindly update to oreo to enjoy full feature ,I made write decision to buy this TV, it looks premium you can easily say it lakh above tv blindly go with this",
            "I've been using this TV for a few months now, and I've concluded that the slightly cheaper non-Android version of this same model would have been a better purchase. However, that model doesn't appear to be available anymore, and the price for this Android version seems to have dipped below what the non-Android version cost when I bought the TV. Here's my detailed evaluation:\n\nPros:\n\n- True HDR10 that works with both Windows 10, and PS4. This panel has entry level HDR performance, with the peak brightness hovering somewhere between 400 and 500 nits - I checked this with calibration tools in many games, and standalone applications on Windows - a difference in brightness is noticeable to within that range.\n- HDR image is (extremely) noticeably better than non-HDR images. I've played Horizon: Zero Dawn on the PS4, and Mass Effect Andromeda on the PC with HDR turned on, and the difference from the non-HDR image is nothing short of startling. In the title screen of Horizon: Zero Dawn, we're shown an image of a valley with the sun rising. With HDR turned on, the sun is \"much\" brighter than the rest of the image, but all the remaining areas remain correctly lit. With HDR turned off, the whole image feels \"flat\", with all portions of the image seemingly compressed in terms of the range of brightness being shown. The increase in image quailty is very difficult to describe, but IMHO, an HDR mastered image is unquestionably better than non-HDR.\n- The HDR image quality difference in Netflix is much less obvious - possibly because of the extreme compression that Netflix content is subjected to anyway. It's still gorgeous.\n- Uncompressed 4K HDR video content looks \"amazing\". Colours pop, and details are super-sharp. I've been using a much older TV / monitors for some time now, so this is a massive upgrade for me, even if this panel is entry-level.\n\nCons:\n\n- Micro-dimming feature doesn't appear to work / makes image contrast worse. This panel is supposed to have a \"full array\" of LEDs for backlight, which should mean that when the feature is turned on, black / darker areas of the image should become darker, thereby increasing contrast - instead the OPPOSITE occurs. Whenever I've turned on micro-dimming, darker areas of the image all brighten! There seems to be some issue with the firmware / software that's controlling the feature - it seems to be doing the opposite of what it's supposed to. This is very disappointing because micro-dimming was one of the highlight features of this TV for me when I picked it over the Mi TV 4K (edge-lit). The feature also seems to introduce visual artifacts (shimmering), which was visible when I played Mass Effect: Andromeda. What's really disappointing is that it feels like this could be fixed with a software update, but I doubt that that's ever going to happen. Manufacturers rarely give software updates for such appliances - features either work out of the box, or they don't.\n- Terribly long boot-up time, and stand-by feature that's supposed to bring the TV back from a low-power state doesn't work consistently. I also experienced some weird image artifacts when playing Mass Effect Andromeda on PC with HDR10 (shimmering). I leave this feature turned off all the time now.\n- Rather boxy appearance - current generation of televisions have much slimmer bezels. These aren't bad looking - it's just that current gen (Mi TV, for example) look much better.",
            "Its exceptional. After 2 weeks of TV hunting and 3 unsuccessful MI TV flash sales, I finally decided to buy this and Boy, it did fulfilled my expectations with ample measures. Like everyone else, I too am thankful that I could not buy Mi TV whose online flash sale is a gimmick as its available on Mi offline stores. When I visited MI store I was not at all impressed with picture quality. SD channels viewing experience was a deal breaker. Black levels were real bad.Sound quality was also average. With that hands on experience I decided not to go with Mi. LG, SONY and SAMSUNG were out of budget. I was also keeping an eye on this as good reviews were pouring in and I was getting confident about it. Then on 12th June sale, I tried to add it to my card casually and it did actually get added. Coming from an MI flash sale experience it was kind of surprise for me and next I found myself punching OTP on payment page LOL. What I mean to say here that ,I did not do enough of research. TV was delivered on 14th June and installation was done on 16th June. Jeeves' person did a good job of getting it installed on 3 days before scheduled date. Thanks to Flipkart for hassle free buying experience. Now coming to Pros and cons.\nPros:\n1. Excellent picture quality. Believe me guys 4k videos are treat to watch. Black levels are really good which enhance the overall viewing experience. HD channels are also playing very good, however it also depends on quality of HD content. I found SD channels playing decent. Its not bad for sure. I have seen reputed brands like Sony and LG and I found they were also not great when it comes to play SD channels. Although I could only review few of their stocks which were under Rs 90k. In this segment it beats Mi hands down.\n\n2. Good sound quality. I have a 12 feet by 20 feet living room and sound level at 30 is more than enough.\n\n3. Good android experience. Games are running smooth and I did not experience any lag whatsoever. Playstore does not have many aps. I was disappointed not to find Prime Video app in there. Yet to try sideloading.\n\n4. Air mouse is convenient. The built of the smaller remote is very good. It comes with two remotes. Did I tell you they packed 2 set of batteries?\n\n5. Aluminum frame looks premium.\n\nCons: I could spot few\n\n1. While watching games like cricket/footballs on Hotstar I found some amount of frame lagging i.e. fast moving videos were not smooth. I am yet to try it on DTH. This could have been better. I need to find out whether this can be fixed with settings.\n\n2. Sound cannot be customized greatly. There are preset sound settings but even after playing with them, I did not find much change in sound quality. Even personal mode does not alter sound. Need to research more on it.\n\n3. TV channels cannot be changed with TV remote.\n\nThats it. For a price of Rs 46k, its a steal. If only it proves to be long lasting, I am sure it will give big brands run for their money. TCL and iFfalcon should think of offering extended warranty for this model. Dont think twice, it surely will fulfill all your expectations with this budget range and even higher. Go for it.",

            "I was looking for Sony e9000 saw the colors and pic quality then compared it to mi and lot of other tv in motion honestly speaking if you were getting sold this 55 inch k2 for 1 lac 10 you wouldnt ask the justification. Great tv specially if you are android freak you wont need to pay even single rs to buy any android box. Everything can be side loaded runs perfectly from kodi to plex. 4K upscaling is same as Sony. And if you really wanna instal hdr 10 or Dolby-vision good news is you can . All you got to do is download and make proper google search so you can get latest software for Atmos or vision. Well gaming honestly I dont know since I dont play games.\n45 grand for tv like that trust me its peanuts . Dont like it after 3 years throw it in garbage. With the android focus on tv market I think expected life of tvs wont exceed 5 years in future.

You can\u2019t really compare it to the giants like Samsung or LG Oleds. But if you are looking for absolute value for money while compromising a bit on picture quality (motion blur is high on this TV), you should go for this one.\n\nThe sound output is superb, don\u2019t buy a soundbar if you don\u2019t need one. Also, don\u2019t expect the boom of a subwoofer either.\n\nPS: Amazon Prime not available on the TV. Shall look it\nup further.",

            "Buy this tv. It is worth more than u pay to buy it. Got it for 37k on the big billion day sale. My review is based on playing netflix, youtube, hotstar, movies from Pendrive and screen casting. Rest of things like screen mirroring and all or not my requirement. It's been an awesome visual experience so far. The label on the box says that it is manufactured by tcl in China. If u just search tcl on youtube u will get all the reviews from north america. Thats how famous tcl is in the U.S. If u don't know about a brand, that doesn't mean its of inferior quality. This tv is awesome. It easily could have been sold for 80k and no one would have complained if it ws of samsung or the likes. Display is stunning. Plays 4k like a charm. Youtube plays 4k without any issues, no lag or stutters. Hotstar also runs like butter. Dont even ask about netflix. Its mind blowing. The tv gives a pop up saying an HDR video is being played when u play one on netflix. Full hd is beautifully upscaled. Sound is also good. I live in a flat not a bungalow. So take the loudness based on that. U can attach a sound bar if not satisfied. I watched manu vs chelsea match on hotstar and did not find any frame drops or motion stutters. The UI is also lag free and very responsive and fast. I played some full hd movies from pendrive and worked flawlessly. The casting from youtube on mobile to tv is also smooth. Not a single issue i faced till now. But i think all this is because i have a 15mbps internet connection with streaming and youtube videos playing at close to 30mbps. People with slow internet connection will surely face issues. I am attaching a picture of an led light bleed test video of the screen to just show how amazing the quality of the screen is. The led back light is uniform throughout the screen. Checkout the uniformity of the backlight. Just a brilliant display. Now please don't compare the level of black u see in the pictures with quantum dot or oled and stuff. U r not paying for that level of blacks. Iam just loving this tv till now. Iam getting more than 3 times i paid for out of this tv. Guys, go for this tv. It plays anything 720p or above with stunning quality.",

            "Bought this Tv in may 2019 and reviewing after 23 months. Had a wonderful experience with dis Tv until today i.e 01-04-2021, the power supply board of this TV got dead. All the comments which i read at d time of buying finally came to be true. Had to replace the PSB for Rs. 7000/- which is way too high. The Tv parts price z not available anywhere in the internet world neither the cc representative knows. We are at the mercy of the technician in respect of the price which he may quote from min 5k and goes upto 15k-20k or even 30k for panel replacement. Buying such tv at high price and getting faulty after 1 or 2 yr is not acceptable. And u may never know wats next after repairing ur tv.",
            "Worked fine for 2 years & i was very happy with the performance. Then last week, suddenly the screen went blank. I can hear the sound however screen is blank. Waiting for the service guys to fix it.",
            "The TV worked for two years with a lot of hiccups fortunately I thought I had purchased Jeeves extended warranty. One day suddenly TV stopped functioning and I tried contacting Jeeves support its been 45 days still no resolution",
            "I am writing this review post 6 months of usage. 1. Booting time- It takes atleast 2 minutes to boot irrespective of the Ram configuration it has. 2. Picture quality:- With right settings you can get 4k resolution matching to other known brands, but it still lacks punch of color and its bleed light sometime from corners for low resolution videos. Overall at this price I would say it outmatch other brand like Vu and Mi and has much better Display. 3. Sound quality- As most of tbe time its connected to our home theater system it will be difficult for me to comment but it was good. Cons:- To be honest I didnt find any major cons, but just to name few, its bluetooth remote consume more battery, after 6 months usage i have to change, which is kind of acceptable as we heavily usage that remote. If you are planning to buy this TV, you can go by trusting reviews of others on this forum as I did and you will not regret.",

            "The packaging of the box was top notch. Bought it during flipkart sale in exchange of my 43 inch LED LG TV. Couldn't have got it for less.The offer I got was mind boggling. I just paid 15k for this TV. Yes 15k for a 55inch 4K LED smart TV. It has Chromecast in built. This is value for money product. The bezels are bigger than that of mi TV and most other TV's. Would have liked the bezels to be slimmer. The picture quality is good. Not the best but it is good for this price point. The speakers are loud and I believe they are downward facing and because I have not wall mounted it, it sounds even better. what I didn't like is the remote. at times you have to press the keys twice for it to work. But overall very happy with the purchase",

            "This is the first day with my Tv. The delivery and the installation happened on the same day which was cool( I was given 2 days for installation but they come on the same day of delivery). Well the installation with Jeevas was good enough. I wished atleast two people should have come for the installation as this tv is huge i had to help him to fix the tv( which was ok on my part).He convinced me to by a Stabilizer for the tv. ( Dont know if its actually required). The picture quality and the sound quality of the Tv is just amazing. I dont understand one thing if this tv is Eled or Dled as at times the corners tends to give bright ray( could be the OS effect too). Nevertheless happy with the product The video quality is crisp with every details. 4k looks beyond amazing. Hd is amazing. Dont expect much from sd. Mind it that this the Tv looks huge.",

            "What shall I say!!! I'm in love with this TV. Everything is perfect, the picture, the sound, the Internet connectivity. The best budget 4K 55 inch smart TV ever made for the Indian Market. Blindly go for it. Don't listen to anyone. This TV is amazing. I'm just mesmerised with this beauty!!! GREAT JOB TCL & FLIPKART !!! Cheers..",
            "Very Nice Service.. I got a Defect in tV it was not connecting to Wifi..They Replaced With a new tv in a week. So fast Service . and Im happy with the TV its working So well !",
            "Installation guy came within hours of delivery. There has been a concern around max brightness. Well its not an issue, Infact i had to bring down brightness. 4k content just looks awesome not so sure about hdr content. The HDR stuff looks same as HD stuff. But UHD stuff blows away your mind.\n\nAndroid Tv is the future. You can install apps that would stream torrents. Bluetooth headphones just connect without need of bluetooth transmitters. Prime video can be sideloaded. Clean recents and mostly it works. Or else you can use Kodi for prime video as well. Best of all JioTV android tv app works as well, wondering why would someone get a DTH connection.\n\nHdmi CEC, ARC etc makes managing connected peripherals a breeze. For e.g. You can use TV remote to manage home theater. The home theater will automatically start when tv starts. Etc etc.\n\nIts a very big screen so if all you are going to watch is HD and are too close to TV then go for 40 inches.\n\nAlso join the telegram group for owners. Lots of people there to help you with any issues or knowledge on stuff related to this TV. People there already have done oreo updates, root, have working twrp, ported MI patchwall etc.",
            "review after using the TV for a good 2 weeks:\n\n1) picture quite good, not the greatest yet very good. does micro dimming work - yes, blacks good - yes, refresh rate - not greatest, IMO for a 55 inch TV should have been at least 100Hz - all points here were referring to HD quality in Netflix, Prime, Hotstar etc. 4K is great\n2) PS4 works great but for a person who plays FPS quite a bit, refresh rate again impacts a bit here, but pic quality is really good\n3) sound is surprisingly good, I did not expect that\n4) connectivity was quick and simple both to WiFi and home theater via bluetooth",
            "I have purchased this on an offer of Rs. 35k for 55 inches.. All features are good and perfect.. I'm satisfied with the product. Thank you FLIPKART...",
            "Great deal for the money spent! Brightness level is so good. Colors are vibrant. Dynamic color mode is giving a great output. Gaming connectivity is slightly lagging. Sound quality is ok",
            "Pros:\n1. Good picture quality\n2. More number of ports availability\n3.Good specifications for this price\n\nCons:\n1.Look and finish not up to expectation, after seen VU pixelight TV I clearly understood that, bezels looks cheap compared to other TV's mainly due to silver finish. Black it would be better.\n\nSome important observation in my one week usage:\n\n1. Picture quality degrades (blur feel for very short period, if you watch from longer distance you may not feel this) for a while during fast moving actions scenes. Need to check whether it is common for all 60Hz refresh rate TVs are not.\n2. Sound quality is good, but some times i feel above average. need to test some more days to conclude.\n3. Google play store won't allow you to install all apps as of now but we can side load apps as per some people, not yet tried this ( Keep this in mind, who are thinking about buying amazon fire stick along with other branded HD Non smart TV, which is good enough to provide all major streaming apps).\n4. Up scaling is average but most common with all TVs, it would be better if some software update could fix it. Watching SD channels are just ok, better for HD channels.\n5. Netflix some lag observed while playing, thought internet connection problem initially, but when i played 4K content in youtube its playing very smoothly during same time. This issue not observed in first four days. Need to see what may be the issue.\n6. Colors are excellent in this TV specially while playing 4K content and also very good HD video quality.\n\nInstallation happened on same day of delivery (Hyderabad), but installation guy not that much professional and not installed as per my liking ( height and center of the wall) even though i am guided him, i raised request at jeeves to look into this for re-installation but they not yet responded.\n\nI will update my review after few months of usage, if it runs longer periods definitely worth buy, need to wait.",
            "Amazing TV. Picture quality is very good, but without 4k it is not worth watching and 4k content and network speed are not available in our country to the satisfactory level. Now BOTTOM LINE is that it is a Mercedes not doubt but sadly on Indian Roads. This hint is enough for an intelligent buyer.",

            "With the price range in which this product is, I would recommend everyone to go for it. 4K, HDR10 and Android smart tv is all that you get for such a minimal price. Absolutely, no issues yet. Other company products range somewhere around 1lakh to 1.5lakh with the same features. So, if someone wants to save some bucks and go for a value for money product, go for it blindly. 5/5 from me.\nPros :\n1. Great Picture Quality\n2. Easy connectivity to internet and apps\n3. Easy Navigation and user friendly\n4. Android based and app store\n5. Volume is good too even for 20*20 hall\n6. Value for money\n\nCons:\n1. None as of now, will surely add one if there is.",
            "very good product iffalcon 55 inch TV worth of money thanks to filpkart for fast delivery and fast installation",
            "tv quality is damn good. speakers at the bottom and sounds great.\nthey have mentioned about free wall mount but not provided better Flipkart should look into it.\nThis tv is by far better than MI.\nAndroid works good",
            "Okayish TV.. not that great as expected. I am an current user of Samsung 7500 49 Inches. Not that reproduction with 1080p..or else 4k is good and decent. You need minimum HD to analyse this TV. Sound is okay for starters..Not that good as reviewed even after altering settings. You will get only this much for this Price.",
            "Worth every penny. The product is awesome. However, you would need to explain the brand to every second person. The design is very good and the TV is comparatively slim. The silver basels look cool and unique. The picture quality is very good but not excellent. You'll feel it low if you have seen the quality of Sony and Samsung. But with this price, the quality is very good. The sound is good and I don't know why people complaints about that. I don't need any soundbar with this.\n\nIf we talk about cons, it takes a lot of time to boot up. Also, if you have plugged in USB, you don't get an option to browse it. You need to unplug and plug it again to get that option. Or you need to download a file explorer for this. I would suggest to download FX Explorer for this. The TV crashes and restarts sometimes like when you connect it with mobile hotspot.\n\nThe jeeves installation was a big time fail. Even after calling them for 3 days to arrive before 3PM, no one came and on the 4th day the tech came at 4PM. They then installated the wall mount with their own screws and didn't use the company provided screws. They didn't even screw them but they hammered them which led to breaking of one screw which they kept as it is. Please don't let them do that. The company provided screws are thick and will hold the mount for ages. Not only this, they mounted the TV a bit tilted and they made some jugaad by inserting some packing on the mount and the TV was still not level. I had to get it level by my own tech some days ago.",
            "guys i took every precaution to avoid the purchase of the wrong product, trust me i have almost read every review and the update of almost every tv in this range, studied every feature of almost 10 tvs from different companies,\nI can assure you purchasing this product was one of the best decision i have ever made.\npicture quality is awesome like anything.\nthe 4k looks very good with micro dimming technology is icing on the cake.\nsound is good, Chromecast HDMI, wifi everything works well\ntrust me its a good purchase.",
            "It is best buy today. I have bought Mi tv and VU tv also earlier but when I bought this one and used it for 2 months, Now I can say this is the best buy for smart TV. TCL is world 3rd largest co and quality of this TV is outstanding. IT is a branded tv.. don't think that it is cheap or unbranded. So my advise is to buy this..",
            "The TV is manufactured by TCL in China. The display of the TV is fantastic. It is a proper 10 bit display with support for HDR10 as well as HLG. Speakers are just okay. I highly recommend using external speakers with the TV for better sound experience.\n\nHowever there are some issues:\n\nFirst - The chipset of the TV is slow. Navigation through the Android interface is not fast. The inbuilt decoder is just enough for playing 4K HDR 60FPS videos. It does not have any processing headroom left when playing such videos. 4K HDR 60FPS videos run smoothly only on the built in media player. If you try to play them on any other player downloaded from the app store, the videos stutter badly.\n\nSecond - The volume output of the optical audio out cannot be controlled. The TV sends out audio at full volume no matter the volume level of the TV. If your home theater system/optical audio decoder has input volume adjustment, then it is fine. However if you don't have adjustment on the audio receiver system, then there is a problem. Because the audio is sent at full volume, there is a lot of disturbance in the audio. Hence this causes the users to have an incomplete experience and leaves them wanting this basic facility in the TV. Because of this flaw, I cannot play videos directly on the TV. I have to play them on some device to which the TV is connected via HDMI and adjust the volume on the playback device. I had to spend 5.5K rupees on purchasing an android box for the TV because of this flaw.\n\nThird - There are bugs in the TV motherboard. Many times the TV restarts while being used. Sometimes is restarts 3-4 times a day. It can get very annoying.\n\nFourth - This is a minor flaw. The TV does not have analogue 5.1 channel output. Hence you need to purchase a decoder if your sound system does not support optical audio input.\n\nBased on my experience I have one recommendation for the buyers: take your time to go through the different settings of the TV. It offers separate video adjustments for SDR, HDR, and HLG videos. Download demo videos of each type and play them directly on the TV through USB storage device and make adjustments for all the profiles of all the video types. Particularly adjust the brightness, as the TV has very high brightness set as default value and you don't need that much brightness. I never need more than 15%, even during daytime. Reducing the brightness will reduce the power consumption and increase the life of the TV components.\n\nThe price of the TV is very good. If you can live with the issues, then it is a very good display at this price.",
            "Last week received my 55 inch gaint TV, Picture quality is really amazing with enough loud sound for my 17x14 feet hall.The product is equivalent to Sony , Samsung or LG because most of part used in Sony is same as in this model.

            "A Good TV! Quick delivery, quick installation. Happy with the performance so far. This is my second UHD TV, the first one was 49 inch ( top manufacturer) bought for 1.6L four years back. I have purchased iFfalcon TV for my BR. The Picture quality, sound performance and smart TV features as expected and at par with my other UHD high end TV. Smart TV features are more sophisticated in this TV compared to other TV as this support full Android store, may be an advancement for last 4 years. This is a good UHD TV in 1/2 of its price. Enough ports for auxiliary connections like USB, HDMI. I am happy BT, but there is A must buy!\n\nHope the maintenance of TCL also will be at par with the other TV.\n\nJust keep you informed about the cons:\n1. The boot time of the TV is exactly 1min, but my other UHD TV takes only about 5sec.\n2. Could not find a menu item to increase the brightness( I am yet to explore all options in this TV)\n3. Bug: When you connect Bluetooth device there is a sound lag of some micro sec. When you switch from Bluetooth to normal TV, the sound lag continues. If you switch between sources and come back to DTH then that get corrected.\n4. Timelag, PVR, EPG options are not there in this TV ( think because we are always on DTH), though its mentioned in the operational manual.\n\nThanks!",

Service people were friendly.\n4. Promotion: IFFALCON has got 4.4 reviews out of 6,520 customer that tempts me in believing the product and buy.\n\nCons:\n1.

For example Jio TV. Jio cinema, hotstar, sony liv working flawless.\nNetflix some times become blurr.

After a year WiFi is not connecting to my tv .. tried many times but no joy. Not all apps are supported for example u cont download prime etc .. when u switch ON wait for min 5 to 8 min to power ON.. it will load too much to get the tv ON. Otherwise value for money",

            "After 8 months.. satisfied..ultimate product.. got in 22k under exchange...\nNetflix runs like butter.. Everything is perfect.. i only find cons is lag of air mouse.. but other remote is functioning smoothly.. Best picture and sound quality in this price range under 40k.. certified android .. T cast touch remote app of TCL make tv as a touch screen...\nActually TCL is Gold standard company of smart LED concepts.. HDR 10 contents of Netflix give you literally goosebumps... Same day delivery by Ekart and same day installation by jeevas services was awesome.. installation engineer explained each and every thing and wall mounted very well.. in india only tata sky providing some 4-5 channels in 4k quality.. but coming era is of 4k in dth segment so this deal is worthy.. After gio fiber data will also cost effective so Netflix and prime video can be easily used . ..\nIf u have budget for this tv .. go for it boldly... 100 times superior panel than MI ,equilant to LG panel...\nHDMI arc and spdif optical sound connectivity, Bluetooth, 5ghz wifi,pre installed Netflix make big differences ..\n4k contents from hard disk and pendrive play smoothly...\nSound is also up to the mark no need of external sound bar... 5* from my side in each and every aspect...

            "Brilliant TV... But safe when we use pure sinewave inverter.... So it's not sudden shutdown.... Best performance even using last 8 months",
            "On this price this is best tv. I am giving feed back after 15 days use. It is too early. But on the besis of 15 days experience it is equivalent to LG & Samsung. It has extra facility of Bluetooth. Which is not available in LG & Samsung. I think it would be long lasting. You may by and save up to 20,000 RS. Thanks",
            "Pros\n1. Excellent Build Quality and Looks Premium\n2. Great Audio quality.\n3. HDR 10 panel\n4. Android certified\n5. Bluetooth Remote along with Normal IR remote\n6. Easy to access HDMI, USB and Aux ports even if wall mounted\n7. Inbuilt Chromecast\n8. Micro dimming which enhances picture quality\n9. Air Mouse is excellent for easier use of tv\n10. Value for money. got for 31k after exchanging CRT tv\n11. Free wall mount included (500rs charged for other TVs)\n\nCons\n1. Slow bootup time because of Android Tv ( takes an average of 60-90secs to boot)\n2. Content below 1080p will look really bad because it is a 4k Tv\n3. Chrome not available on play store. (Can be sideloaded)\n4. No user manual provided with the TV\n5. TV will be automatically turned off in 60secs after a warning popping up. Not sure how it works. Mostly it pops up at late night. it's a auto stand by mode. still haven't find a solution to turn it off.\n\nOther then this TV is must by at this price range.\nRating 9/10",
            "My money got the right product for Me. This is what I feel right now. Have seen mi 4 pro. In comparison this one produces lot more black depth than latter. If you looking for MI tv, go for iffalcon it's Way better in terms of pic and sound quality.",
            "Initially was so confused to buy it as it was a new brand all to geather.. But at the end I went for it seeing all reviews. I did a right choice of buying it. Definitely value for money.. Guys it is indeed value for money. Best specs and best price.. You will not get it in any brand.. I strongly recommend you to buy this TV as it offers a lot in it. \ud83d\udc4d",
            "This is an excellent smart tv with Android. Connects to WiFi and you can download any app from the google play store. Picture quality is excellent and very good pricing. I am writing this review after 4 months of usage and i find this TV to be excellent and highly recommemded.",
            "super good tv! must buy! picture and connectivity is great! but sound is not that great! we need to connect a home theatre system to use it fulfill! it comes with Android 7.0 i think it is upgradable! works perfect!",
            "Excellent.\nOne single word \"excellent\" for this TV.\nEarlier gone through other's review praising this product. I was in doubt. However I wanted to take a chance seeing low price. After getting the the TV and seeing it's performance, I am simply amazed. Outstanding performance at unbelievable price. Picture quality and connectivity are at per with high end TV like Sony, Samsung or Panasonic. Add a Bluetooth speaker system with good bass (you will get it at price less than Rs 10,000), you will find theatre like feelings.\nMy decision was correct.",
            "so let's start with the pricing\n\nI bought it at 32k something and it got further cheap. no worries\n\nPS - if any of you are comparing it with Sony /LG/Samsung- Better wait, improve you budget and then buy those brands as though specifications are good but you cannot compare with the experience you get from those high brands.\n\nPros\nBudget TV\n\ngood built - unlike mi the built is really solid... comes in aluminium casing and sturdy stand the built is far better than good .\n\ndecent sound - really nice is the word....you can get a sound bar if you like...but it doesn't disappoint. I have been using this in my hall (300 sq ft approx ) and never have to turn the volume above 65\n\ngood picture quality - really good if not awesome like Samsung qhd... blacks are good whites are balanced...you may notice extra yellow/red but plenty of setting options\n\nandroid - Certified android now in oreo\n\nCons\n\nWell hard to find cons....\n\nsound - Bass - could have been better\n\njust the oreo interface is good but I found previous one better\n\n\nfor all those complaining....if any-- this is really good TV at the price",
            "picture quality, sound quality, overall good features with excellent packing and perfect delivery I'm Happy with this Product, Go for it, Value for Money..",
            "I saw many reviews here about some bad experience with this TV. Hence after my purchase I waited for 1 month to post a review and my experience has been really great with this TV.\n\nMy actual use of this TV is for PS4 pro gaming and YouTube Hotstar. Both experience has been great a value of money product.\n\nThe only issue I faced is with Voice command that is getting Hanged when I try to use. It did work before and recently I faced this issue. I assume it needs an update and should fix this issue.\n\nRest the overall experience has been great with this TV.",
            "My review after 2 weeks, the picture quality is excellent only on full HD and above, so you should have the one if you want to enjoy the features. I am using external sound bar using HDMI ARC and the sound quality is good with required bass. I got it for around 19k after my old 32 Samsung led exchange, so I believe it's a good deal for me. So overall it's worth at this price where as other brands are higher with similar features.",
            "Everything from picture quality to sound to connectivity is good. My blaupunkt sound system does not get recognized via HDMI ARC or Bluetooth. I think it's issue with the sound system, as I'm able to connect other headphones using Bluetooth. I connected sound system using optical out and is good. One major cons: SD video up scaling is not upto the mark. Side loaded prime video. It works but picture quality on prime is not as good as you tube. It may be prime video streaming issue. If you get it less than 30K it's a good deal.",
            "I dont use android part of TV so I dont have any idea how it fares in that domain, but from HDMI input perspective and from a current laptop this TV shines. Lots of customization and minimal LED bleed. We can tweak and get enough saturation for a good casual Multimedia Experience. Audio is good via Digital Optical Output plus it sounded powerful via headphones output too. Metallic Bezels are cool and can match those steel vintage Sony/Philips Amps and Players. I cannot ask for more from this TV. In fact the seller had scheduled an installation personnel too but we all know they lack the necessary IQ to set modern TVs. If this is what a cheap average TV has to offer I am interested in seeing what is held by those high end TVs.\n\nLast but not the least- the courier fellows opened the set and gave liberty to turn it on and check before they left. This saves a lot of trouble in case some manufacturing or transportation defect occurs.\n\nThanks TCL, Flipkart and Courier services. Keep up the good job.",
            "After a long reviews I bought this TV. it's really nice clarity is superb. installation done in one day itself. it's very user friendly. 4k clarity it's very good. you can go for external speakers. watching a big screen picture in tv sounds won't be much good.. better have a external speakers. other than this it's excellent",

            "It's a good TV and clarity of the TV is nice as well. I personally liked the clarity better than VU 55' Inch TV.\n\nBut while using the smart features, sometimes I have notices that the TV gets rebooted. We have used this TV for 3 months and I am observing this from past few weeks.\n\nHowever the Clarity for Non HD channels (SD Channels) is not at all good. They are very blurry and it's really bad. Not sure if it's the same with all 4K tv.\n\nNetflix and YouTube work fine and the apps are pretty responsive with no lags.\n\nI stay in a relatively small city and the delivery was really quick and installation was done the next day.\n\nOverall it's a good product, but I would say if you buy any of the three TVs i.e. iFFALCON, MI or VU your decision wont be wrong as these 3 TVs are very similar in terms of features. price and build quality.",

            "I bought this Tv 3 days back. well timed delivery and correct time installation happened. simply superb, value for money TV. My kids enjoying Watching Animals in big screen with Good 4k videos..tks to Flipkart for this budget Tv.",
            "This was my first 4k tv so was a bit sceptical over going for a lesser known brand. Big brands cost too much and with the technology changing at such a rapid rate, investing so much money on a big brand tv didn't seem worth to me. Out of all available options, this seemed the best choice. Had shortlisted Xiaomi, VU and Iffalcon in the 55\" 4k tv segment. Trust me this is undoubtedly the best choice. Great connectivity options, decent picture quality and looks premium. The voice controlled remote is a cherry on top. Loved it.\nFew points to note for the manufacturers, 1) After wall hanging the USB & HDMI ports on the sides become a bit difficult to access, 2) Downfiring speakers are not so effective\n\nSummarizing, if any one is looking for a decent 4k 55\" tv in this price range, go for it. Don't think twice. Also I opted for extended two years warranty offered by Flipkart, might come in handy. Thanks to Flipkart for on time delivery.",
            "I am using this TV from October good picture and sound quality is awesome overall good product I'm giving 5 \ud83c\udf1f to this product. There is no word to say about 4k video quality..

            "TV is good and overall experience is satisfactory. Good pick amongst budget TV.\n\nThey should work to improve overall UI experience and optimisation of boot time.\n\nIt's a must have for your living room",
            "My Thoughts: (After 15 days of installation and usage)\n* Everybody said - think about buying smthng so expensive as this company (TCL) is not much heard in India; go for MI\n* I took the risk looking at the comparison in tech specs for MI 4k & TCL 4K. I'm happy, i paid it gladly\n* This is by far the best purchase I made on Flipkart (after My MacBook Air of course)\n* Yet to experience gaming though\n\nPro:\n* Elegant look ; Performance is good\n* Picture and Audio Quality is great\n* Price is definitely the best for a 55 inch 4K Smart TV range\n* Easy to pair Bluetooth devices (specially headphones)\n* Best part is mirroring mobile device, is so good\n* Installation and demo was really good. 1 Star for Jeeves technicians\n\nCons:\n* Don't update all the apps at once or none will get updated. Update one app at a time\n* Takes 2-3 click on the remote to switch on the TV\n* e-Manual is basic; Need more information regarding settings and TV setup\n* Google Speech recognition using TV remote requires some serious update. Work like charm sometimes only\n* Need some kind of app to use Mac laptops wirelessly, as I have to use HDMI cable and converters. Its pretty inconvenient.\n\nOverall 5 star coz it was worth it. Thanks to Flipkart, TCL & Jeeves.",

I would highly recommend this in compared to MI, Thompson, VU or shinco. It has the worth to even compete with higher ranges of TVs. Great going TCL. As many people have concern regarding after sales service, just fix it and retain the top position in budget segment. Good I took a long to decide and went with the best..",
            "Delivery and installation was very fast. The TV is definitely value for money. But there are quite some cons to the TV. Android is not updated to Oreo. while the Bluetooth remote looks and feels beautiful in hands, it is very slow to connect and operate as well.\n\nIt feels as though it doesn't justify the high specs compared to MI. TV boot up time is more, I find it difficult to wait 45 secs to boot during every power outage as the DG kicks in.\n\nwhile there are very good display configuratio...\nREAD MORE",
            "Awesome product, just been using for two days now. Will have to see how long it runs :-)\nLongevity is yet to be seen.\nPicture quality is excellent and cinematic, ranging by around 60 degrees right or left (that\u2019s 120 degrees; pretty good). Beyond that it\u2019s still great but shows higher color contrast - this is understandable given the technology (ELED on LCD) and price.\nSound is quite good; I have a 240 sqft space with a fairly big wall. You need to look at such big screen from at least 7-8 feet away. I have it wall mounted; technician says that\u2019s safer. On stands, any TV can topple if anyone mistakenly gives it a push.\nConnectivity is excellent. Connected to my home Wifi pretty fast and seamlessly. Remotes are quite intuitive.

I prefer go ifalckon instead mi and yu.",
            "Do not hesitate to buy this new brand iFFalcon from TCL. Being a tech blogger, I have a habit of experimenting and I did go with this brand as the picture quality as far better if we compare it with MI or other competitors. Though the bezels don't look rich in look, but the picture quality is just good. Using air remote is just fun with voice search feature. I would say the Android TV has to go a long way, as it the normal exploring works lag free at the start, but it lags after a while. Still the experience was good. I tried casting my phone, used different apps like youtube, netflix & hotstar which can be downloaded through its own app store or play store. Played Asphalt game on the TV, used my smartphone as Android Remote. Overall experience was great and playing 4K videos was a great experience too.\n\nThe most amazing of all was the service from Flipkart Delivery and Jeeves(Flipkart's Service tie-up company). I got the TV delivered in 2 days and it was installed the same day in the evening. The quick installation was a shocker as I didn't expect this kind of good service. As flipkart has tied up with 3rd party company for service and installation, I was very confused if I should go with this brand or not. But it turned out to be a great decision.\n\nThe only 2 cons that I found were:\n1. Bezels/design could have been a bit better.\n2. The Android TV UI using experience could be more lag free!\n\nApart from that its a best buy!",

            "So late delivery from seller I really hate kinda like this delaying people.. But product is really awesome no any objection.. It's a good TV guys please go for it comparing to other TVs in this price segment.. If you want bass and subwoofer sound then you guys need one subwoofer and soundbar.. Sound is stereo louder & crystal clear of inbuilt speakers and it's just 16W but louder than 20w of Vu speakers. But you can't enjoy music, hip-hop songs and we don't feel cinema theatre sound as how we enjoy in bass woofers or in deep bass headphones.. So that's it Hope you guys enjoy this simple good lovely TV\n\nIffalcon settings are not good we can't clear recent apps, must and should update this TV ROM there is no brightness increasing and decreasing option, and play store is just name of play store no more apps.. If TV is certified with android then why shouldn't run all android apps at least which are useful android apps according to TV category those apps should we find in play store, not properly updated by Indian team the TV software, and why not properly run prime video application? we bought this TV because it's give all features of android.. many apps which are useful on TV those apps are running by third party",

            "Image quality is just ok, Tcl tv has good image quality n HD to 4k upscaling is amazing in TCL tv compare to this tv, no smooth motion blur feature in this tv so u will see blur in fast moving scence, tried all picture setting but of no use, quite disappointed with this TV as i thought it will have all TCL tv picture setting menu but it was just an ordinary 4k tv with only certified android feature which is great. Customer who have seen image quality of TCL tv should not expect same feature in this tv. Rather go for TCl android 55inch tv but will cost 10k extra but you will get complete satisfaction with the product feature. Sound quality is amazing with tru dts.",

Watching netflix is such a joy.\nThe smart remote is way beyond the other smart remotes of the time. You can type and navigate with ease with the smart remote.\nYoutube , Hotstar play very well.\nThere is so much you can do on this smart tv.\nIt will take me some time to explore all the features on this tv.\nThe design of the TV is eye catching, it will add more glamour to your living room or bedroom.\nThe make of it is very sturdy, unlike MI TV which is very fragile.\nYou can connect bluetooth home theatre system, blue tooth headphones, wireless mouse and keyboard. You need not to unpair one bluetooth device to pair the other.\nScreen Cast works flawlessly.\nThere are ample of usb and hdmi ports to cater to all your needs.\nThe tv is smart enough to learn and show up what content you watch more and which apps and channels you tune into more and shows up the same on the streaming menu for your ease of access.\nTHERE IS ALOT MORE TO WRITE. AT LAST I WOULD JUST SAY DO NOT GO FOR ANY OTHER. JUST BUY THIS ONE , YOU WON'T REGRET.\nTHANKS.\nJAI HIND.",

Smart feature is a boon but sometimes it lags but that's something we can ignore of it. 4k video is very clear and crisp, overall i liked the product, a bang for buck to those wanting to buy 55 inch tv.

Ive been using this to play videos and it plays pretty smoothly. Been watching movies and it's really awesom! Had issues with the smart remote though. Did not still figure out how that's used. Can't get the air pointer, or voice inputs from the remote. It just says use it by pressing a button combo from within 1 meter of the TV. Well that didn't work. So used voice controls from my phone, and that works.",

But 55 inch is made for 4K. Waiting to watch the 4K contents. Anybody listening in TV channels coterie?\n\nI suggest, for non HD channels, TV should give an update to enable watching on reduced screen size as pictures in these channels get too blurred to watch comfortably.\nOverall, Satisfied to buy this. A value for money product. Hope it's durable one.",
            "It is a best TV among available products in the market. Company should provide better approved wall mount stand for 55 inches led tv so as to convenient to plug in pen drive any other accessories.

            "Tv seems to be bang for the buck. Looks nice. Flipkart delivery on time.\nPicture quality:\nUHD videos are awesome. Can directly play or cast it from YouTube app as well out of the box. I have an iPhone and it directly detected the TV and started playing in 4k resolution. Netflix also comes out of the box. I have a standard plan so didn't play 4 k. Only 1080p and it was good.\nTata sky HD channels looks good, especially natgeo, hbo, etc. SD channels are ok. The up scaling is not up to the mark for SD channels compared to my old Samsung, which is expected and I am ok with.\nSound :\nIt's pretty loud. I don't use my sound bar now.\nCons: Can be a deal breaker for many.\nThe installation guys never arrived. So I installed on my own. I had bought the extended warranty. Thinking of canceling the same since I don't expect great service from them. So removing one star. If you're ok with taking a gamble of bad after sales service go for it. TV will never disappoint you.\nAdvice to flipkart, get your act together for after sales, you have a good product on your hands.",

            "1). There is no charm in purchasing this TV, as even other brands are available with better features around the similar price,or even less. There are certain applications which don't even run on this TV. The piece I have got does not even sustain running on a program for long, and gets out from it, you need to reboot everytime. Remote has a lag in connectivity. And so most of the time you find yourself working on your mouse and TV, and not enjoying anything. There are spots on the screen through out, and the screen texture is not uniform.\n2). Then comes the technical backup, which is worst. Jeeves people lack in even in basics. One that visited us did not care to not to hold TV from screen. He should have used the polyethylene cover till instation. But after hanging the TV, one could see his hands marked all over the screen. He adamantly said that this is how we do it.\nHe even did not know the basics on issues like light bleeding, sound equalizer, settings, ARC, etc.\nThereafter, he connected call to his office and insisted on me to talk to them and give him highest rating.\nI didn't want that, but it seems the person on the other end also wanted to close the call.\nI told him that rating in his presence is not appropriate, and it is rediculous.\nBut it seems this works for Jeeves to show/ present their efficiency everywhere in marketing, but sure not going to improve their working.",

It also has inbuilt Google Chrome Cast so whenever I am watching some videos in Facebook or YouTube and want to watch it on big screen I just tap Cast button on my phone and it's done, I can watch it on big screen in just a click.\n\nDon't think about much options, just click on \"Buy now\" button and buy it right now.\n\nIt is the best TV we can get in this price range.",

On time delivery smooth installation and an awesome 4k+ HDR smart TV running on ANDROID. Using it for weeks now, it has been a breezing experience, though some apps lagged at first but once it got in flow I can't complain. Though not slim and stylish as MI TV but has a good design and looks premium.\nNow why to buy 4k TV when you Can't get that content easily, for that I tel...\nREAD MORE",
            "i got an amazing offer from flipkart.. and it actually batter then MI tv, and other budget tv.. yes if you hear that VU is batter then TCL..

I m ok to spend another 5k on wireless speakers\nside loaded voot & Amazon prime does not work.\ndid not get wall mount in the box and the tech who came to Install did say a lot of customer have this issue in last few days.. still talking to Flipkart about it.\n\nmy 32\" Samsung smart TV looks like a baby in front on it.",
            "Very happy with the purchase. Delivery for swift from flipkart. The picture quality is fantastic for the price and the smart tv functions are lag free and smooth. Audio output is very good too. Just go for it if you are looking for a budget 55 inch tv. TCL nailed it with this product",
            "been using by 1 weak. Overall good product as far as now. for this price its a nice product. it have nice features. display is good as compared to this price range tv. good sound, but i feel some disturbance in sound,may be video probs.",
            "I had tried to buy mi tv 4 from the last three months and i wasn't able to get one.So I am fully satisfied after buying this product.\nThe picture resolution is marvellous and we can find deep blacks in videos.Sound is far better than mi and works good even without soundbar.Before buying this i wasn't sure about the company but believe me if you are having a budget of around 50k then it must be your choice.We get all high end features like official android,4K HDR,Dolby dts,Micro dimming etc. at an affordable price..overall it's an happy buy.",
            "Though it is relative and the review will vary from person to person, still from my personal perspective its just a awesome product at this price range. As it is a smart TV, the overall performance will mainly depend on the internet speed. These are so many features in the TV, still need to be explored.\nTill now the following are the Pros and Cons:\n\nPros:\n1. Dolby HDR Pro function is amazing - 4K Videos\n2. Voice search from BT remote is awesome\n3. Variety of connectivity ports in the TV\n4. Operation are very user friendly\n5. Google Play Store function is awesome and very smooth\n\nCons:\n1. Sound is good and clear but can be improved\n2. Fixed Wall Mount supplied in the box, no adjustable wall mount, so need to unmount the TV if the back side ports needs to used. Prefer to make all the connections and then wall mount.\n3.",

            "Best TV in this range. I had researched all TVs which fall in this price range (VU, MI, TCL, Thomson) but some of them had some flaws. But this iFFALCON is best in this range.\nThe most important thing is it support all major social entertainment apps like Netflix, prime, hotstar, jio, zee, sony, youtube and many more which lacks in other TVs.\nPicture Quality is brilliant in HD or 4K. Sound is also great.\nOverall i would suggest go for this TV if you are looking in cheap range.",

            "No picture quality enhancement, It\u2019s only for HD and above, can\u2019t watch SD.\nAnd sound is loud enough may need external audio system for better quality.\nBut overall this is very good at this price.\n\nBoot time is almost more than a minute.\nTCL has to provide system update for latest OS with quick boot.",

            "A very good product for the money you pay. Connectivity is good and so is the picture quality. Cannot compare the picture quality to that of LG or any other big brands, but then again the price difference is also huge. Would definitely recommend buying this one if you are on budget.",

            "for the price it's a steal.. great quality picture.. easy to handle and understand. smart remote is not the best in the industry but for the price it's more than great..",
            "I am writing this review after using the product for 2weeks. I bought this at no cost Emi (awesome buy for me of the year). I am using this one as internet tv with no dth connection. (only through Apps). I have bought the same after reading all reviews and videos comparing other models and brands within the price range and beyond. (Sorry but no comparison with O-led TVs.)\nPros:\nPicture quality too good, provided you have a good speed in your internet plan. one can enjoy the best quality watching 4k and ultra HD videos.\nEasy to connect: The product is easy to connect even with all other smart devices specially Alexa and Google home speakers.\nSound : Sound is okay and you can adjust the TV's internal speakers through both the remotes. It should be perfect for mid sized drawing, but one may require good quality speakers for hallrooms.\nThe package comes with 2 remotes but I bet you will start loving the smart remote with comes with voice command as well.\nDelivery and Installation: Both delivery and installation were quick and the installation guy was quiet patient enough to show me all features and guided me to install apps.\n\nCons: As the TV comes with basic android.tv framework, there needs to be a lot of work done. Specially there are many streaming app which you won't find available in the Android TV play store. (though one can use the side-load these apps by downloading the Apps' Apk files in pendrive and install them as and when required, still as these apps have to side loaded there are some issues for some apps as they can't be updated) I faced this issue with apps like Jio Tv and Addatimes and Hoichoi. I hope these apps creators work on Android TV compatible versions soon.\nNetflix doesn't come pre-installed and one has to side-load it, but it works perfectly fine. (for side-load please check YouTube videos available)",

HDR PICTURE CLARITY IS GOOD WHEN VIEWING HD CHANNELS LIKE STAR SPORTS HD STAR MOVIES HD ETC... HEARING PEEP SOUND WHILE MUTING AND UNMUTING THE SOUND.SPEAKERS ARE NOT PAR . I GIVE 2/5 FOR SOUND AND SPEAKERS IN THE TV. I DONNO HOW TO INCREASE BRIGHTNESS AND IMPROVE COLOR TONE IN THIS TV. I DIDNT TRY 4K VIDEOS IN THIS TV. IF U WANT TO BUY A TV FOR AROUND 35K GO FOR IT. DONT EXPECT PICTURE CLARITY AND CRYSTAL CLEAR PICTURE QUALITY LIKE SAMSUNG AND SONY TVS IT GIVES YOU NORMAL VIEWING EXPERIENCE WITH OK HDR QUALITY. FOR VIDEO CLARITY I GIVE 3.5/5. SD CHANNELS GERTING PIXALTE BECAUSE OF BIGGER SCREEN SIZE. SUBSCRIBING HD CHANNELS ARE MANDATORY . PERSONS WHO WANNA BUY AN AVERAGE TV GO FOR IT .DEFINITELY PAISA VASOOL BUT NOT MAKE U PROUD .",

            "I got this product for 22100(In Offers),\nFirstly I would like to say it's value for Money,\n\nwell coming to this TV part,\nit's having a 55 inch wide screen 16 watt speakers which makes sounds good,\n\nis coming to the screen having very good colour display in 4k technology,\n\nconnectivity is good, you can connect with Wi-Fi it is also supporting for bluetooth 4.0",
            "I i purchased reading reviews about budget 4k tv below 50k rs and this seemed fit, Now coming to performance picture-looks good 4k,1080, even 720 seems decent,sd looks okayish. Distance of viewing will also effect your perception(read guides over Internet to know least distance for size of tv). Although the brightness seems low at times it would have been excellent if it was higher and & there was some sort of motion blur in some scenes while watching some scenes in some scenes only will try to upload the video (not sure about if its called motion blur or what). In some colours you can see that it is brighter at edges and there is some areas less brighter also at edges this might be because its edge lit. sound - surprising good for 16 watt speakers, loud, crisp and clear. Connectivity-good overall, but bluetooth headset stays connected you have to unpair them to disconnect, usb 3 port is provided so thats good for connecting hdd. Apps-not even browser is preloaded, have to side load mozilla, chrome etc.youtube looks good video loads fast. Side loaded apps doesn't show up on homepage.tv feels slow at times (button pressing and reaction delay is there) misc-tv takes more time to turn on than expected, Airmouse remote is good but its bottom edges keeps annoying me when constant holding the remote. Installation was done on next day of delivery. All in all satisfied with the purchase considering the cost, i guess people who demand higher brightness can seek other alternatives. No con is that great to skip this tv from price viewpoint (except brightness, uneven brightness and motion blur thing).",

            "TV is considerably good and value for money. Ekart delivery was little troublesome as the delivery person initially reluctant to collect CRT for exchange. As per offer, I had to give 14inch CRT but I handed over 21 inch proper working CRT. After certain discussion, finally they delivered the product and picked up my CRT. Installation by Jeeves was prompt. I took Flipkart 2 year extended warranty. So entire brand image and sales grwoth of iFFALCON is in the hands of Jeeves. All boils down to service of Jeeves in future as if the TV with excellent connectivity worked properly considering extended warranty, it's amazing buy.",

I got this TV with additional 2 years warranty aggregating to @Rs.37,000/-(34k for tv + 3k for warranty) alongwith no interest EMI of 9 months. I can challenge you won't get good bargain than this rate and am really thankful to Flipkart for the same. Booked on Friday 5th April and Delivered on Sunday morning and same installed by evening. Too good Service by Flipkart.\n\nAbout TV - 1) good build quality, has all the ample required required connectivity inputs. 2) Picture quality is too good both HD and 4K. SD formats are also nice to view. I am comparing it with high end TV's like Samsung etc but best viewing angle has to be from for view and I think everybody views it from front than side seating. 3) Sound quality excellent. No need for soundbar for this TV as required in VU and MI 4) Mira castings, gaming, downloading even side downloading of apps. Hotstar Netflix almost say everything works fantastic. Have not yet tried downloading Jio TV but Jio Cinema is working excellent. if you have fluctuations problem install nice Vguard Digi 200 stabiliser for safety of your TV as such damage is not covered under warranty.\n\nit's toooo gooood real value for money keeping quality high. just go for it.\n\nAdding to my review after using it for 5 months :\n\nIt doesn't boot now. The system is hanged. After complaint was lodged with the Manufacturer, they came after one day and just inspected the TV and returned saying will come after few days with the required Software kit for booting the TV externally. I just don't understand the logic of them coming to repair not properly equipped as I had clearly had said in my complaint that TV is not booting. it's disgusting",
            "Friends, don't make 2nd though. Just go for it. You won't get such amazing offer. You name the feature which should be available in any smart TV, that is available in this android TV.",

            "Functional wise TV is good in all respects.\nPicture Clarity is Awesome\nSound Good in all modes supported with 5 modes.\nNo connectivity issues with WiFi, Hotstar, Netflix and T-cast\nonly problem is with the Service of Jeeves pretty reluctant when addressing to the Customer.",
            "False Marketing it is not real HDR TV Read the full comment below to understand\n\nEverything is perfect you get what you pay for better than Mi TV. Brightness is less than 300nits still it\u2019s good enough for HDR gaming(I use it as a monitor for cinematic gaming with my PC and with my PS4).\n\nOnly problem is HDR Dose t work it says HDR but instead of popping up the colours when HDR kicks in it desaturates everything and makes everything foggy and also I tried side loading Amazon prime video tried multiple versions everything crashes randomly in 2mins to 2 hours and reboots the TV it\u2019s too random can\u2019t predict when and why it crashes and reboots the TV.\n\nFound Amazon prime video in an built-in app \u201cTV+ app\u201d but it doesn\u2019t work well have to search every time even the apps installed. It doesn\u2019t show the downloaded apps in home screen and it also doesn\u2019t show the installed apps in the my apps section don\u2019t know how the TV+ app works it\u2019s a total mystery. Tried searching and opening the installed Amazon prime video app which resides within the TV+ app but is much worse than side loading from a external flash drive this thing crashes in every 5 seconds.\n\nStick to what apps are comparable and offered by he google play store for the TV.",
            "first I thought buying a brand which is not that much familiar and in this price range would suffice my need of fulfilling a TV experience on my bedroom.. surprisingly the output this TV has been giving me is absolutely fantastic.. the major advantage of this television is that it's connectivity... how will be that kinda feel when you can stream 1080p videos with an Airtel mobile hotspot..!?.. ya it's Airtel . it just compatible with all the video formats which mi TV doesnt allow you to play... built in chrome case is brilliant... the voice control stopped working for me when the tv is 2 months old.. however as it is not a concern with the HW piece I will wait for a software update to fix this.. as far as the sound is concerned .. it's good when compared to other TV s in this price range but you a loosing kind of notice when you tend to play any low quality stuff in this . might be not a beast for hardcore gamers but definitely worth a buy for someone who is looking for their first TV upgrade or someone who looks to buy a 55 inch which will suffice all their basic requirements . I would definitely recommend it.. this review is posted after 7 months of TV usage.",

            "was sceptical before buying after checking so many TVs in and out.\n\nthis one is really good for the price. Picture quality is almost perfect. sound could have been better. but a sound bar will amplify the experience to another level.\n\nall the smart TV functionalities are working wonderfully.\n\nHD channels can be enjoyed at the fullest and SD are not bad.\n\nyou have all that you need for a smooth functionalities in an Indian family.\n\nwe are satisfied with the product. will definitely recommend.",

            "I'm using this TV since November working perfectly no issue till I take time to post review so I can use well then post review it's awsome TV worth buying it value for money I'm editing my review after almost a year it's a fabulous product I'm using this TV almost a year working superb no complaints at all go for it guys",
            "I was a bit sceptical when buying this TV because of some negative reviews online, but trusted my gut and thought of taking a chance by buying the extended warranty with it. Got it delivered in 2 days time and got the installation done the same day by Jeeves. Have to say I had a really good experience with the delivery and the installation. The installation guy was prompt on arranging a time and had set up the TV along with setting up the TV and doing all the explainations on the working of the TV. He promptly gave a demo of the TV and helped me checked the whole panel for any defects. So for service and delivery 5/5\n\nTV picture quality -\nHave to say it has got an amazing picture quality, I only use digital contents and all of them looked amazing, don't know about SD channels as haven't tried those yet. You can really make out the difference with HDR contents so again 5/5 on display.\n\nSound -\nBuilt in speakers are pretty satisfactory for a budget TV. I am using a home theatre with digital out and that's working perfectly fine and giving a better sound quality than compared to my old Panasonic TV.\n\nSoftware -\nThe software at first was running butter smooth but after playing around a bit and downloading a few softwares it became quite slow. So I had to restart the TV after which it became fine. Just a TIP if the software becomes laggy then keep the home button pressed and exit the apps that you aren't using like you do in phones and viola the software stops becoming laggy, so its all good on that end too :)\n\nVerdict -\nI have just been playing with the TV for a day and so far it checks all the box especially for the price that I got it for. Fingers crossed it should continue to function the same for the coming years. I personally think you should buy this TV in a heart beat can't get a better value for money than this.",
            "I ordered this TV on 11th march19 got delivered on 13 to my surprise the TV screen broken which is visible during installation, I contacted the customer care as well person came to installation was good and genuine , Both Flipkart and jeevs person made the replacement smoothly and new TV came back on 14th , working perfectly and best part is picture quality at affordable price tag.

            "This TV is real value for money.\n\n- Picture quality is mind blowing at this price.\n- 4K, Full HD videos look amazing.\n- SD videos look shitty though. It is expected as the TV is Giant 55 inch 4K and converts SD videos to 4k resolution. Nahh!! ofcourse it will look bad.\n- It offers good viewing angle.\n- Sound quality is pretty good. It can get quiet loud so I didn't feel the necessity of an external speaker.\n- Using Tata Sky and the HD channels are OK.\n- It is android certified and you will be able to download most of the common android apps.\n- Amazon Prime can be sideloaded and works like charm.\n- HDR is supported and Netflix HDR 10 videos are stunning.\n- The Bluetooth remote with air mouse and voice recognition functionality serves it purpose.\n\n- The software is kind of buggy and I have already factory reset the TV once. After reset, Its working fine till now.\n- The interface is sluggish sometimes.\n- Motion blur is quiet evident if you are close to the TV. If you are at 8 to 10 foot distance, you won't recognise the blur.\n\nThe installation and demo support was horrible. The person who came for installation din't even know a thing about the TV and he dint wall mount the TV properly. Jeeves support, grow up and don't take installation service for granted. Flipkart, BEWARE!! your reputation is being spoiled bcoz of Jeeves. Afterall, any service in Bangalore is horrible. The service mentality is lacking here.\n\nFinal verdict-\n\nThis TV with all the features (4K, HDR, 16 GB ROM, 2.5 GB RAM, Official Android etc,) it brings to the table is real value for money. Afterall, the technology inside matters and not the brand. A person who understands technology will not blindly go behind any brands (ofcourse I am talking about Samsung, Sony etc.). cheers!\n\nFYI, I got this TV for 32000 after exchange and discount. steal deal!",
            "So far so good after installation, picture quality: 4K videos are simply perfect, I do use Sony android 4K and could match up nearly the same quality... 1080 HD videos are quite good. Non HD videos are reasonably good in quality. There is slight lag in frame to frame transition but which can be noticed only when there is a fast frames change over.... otherwise it is smooth normally...it would have been better if they could have provide Amazon prime along with featured apps. That\u2019s missing but compromising....\nSound: sound is ok only but not bad. We can\u2019t expect all for this cost... for the cost it is worth...sound you make it better with a sound bar as you wish... overall it\u2019s a worth for the money",

Netflix HRD and Ultra HD contents are all plays smoothly and clarity is soo good and the color reproduction is amazing (Leave the Deep Black aside).\n2. YouTube Full HD videos are upscaled and looks beautiful in this TV. 4K videos having option to select the resolution (4k, Full HD & HD)\n3. Picture quality of this TV is far more better than the MI TV\n4. Sound quality is amazing as when compared to MI TV it is far better than that.\n5. Connectivity is ok.\n6. Air mouse and Google assistance is amazing.\n\nCons:\n1. Bluetooth audio quality is not as per expected.\n2. USB connectivity is not good.\n3.

            "best option for 55 inch 4k smart TV.... bought on great deal...38k for TV and 2k for 2 years extended warranty ..... wallmount installation was free......thanks a lot to flipkart",
            "Great television, with best picture quality. Equally good sound quality. Happy to buy iffalcon 55 inch TV",
            "Awsome tv.. Installed 2 dayz back.. No issues yet. I have wall mounted the same.. HD channels look stunning.. Sd channels also look good but unmatched to hd.. Side hdmi and usb ports are easily accessible and no issues of area around it.",
            "This TV is a perfect value for money you pay. Perfect picture for HD channels and 1080p and above videos. SD channels also being rendered in a quality which is much better for such a huge size of a display. The best part of the TV is its wonderful audio. The Dolby audio works pretty good and amazing. My small Fenda Home theater started sounding entirely excellent on connecting to this TV. I could experience an almost a Dolby Theater like sound. Overall its Awesome. I need to mention the service of Jeeves for installation. The technician is so patient and they have responded within 1 hour of my request to install the TV immediately after deliver. Wonderful buying and installation experience. Great job flipkart for the great offer and great service.",
            "It's a fabulous TV. It is very close to Sony/Samsung in terms of Picture, Sound and Build Quality. Even it has various value adds compared to any TV in this price range. I would have given 5 out of 5 stars, but giving one star less, because it doesn't have functionality to sync and control DTH programs directly in it's smart wall using it's smart remote (which is available in MI TV). For this you will have to use the DTH remote separately. But overall i can say it is way better than MI TV, as I compared both of them side by side with 4K videos and functionalities.",
            "Wow.. whata TV at the Price, firstly I was reluctant to buy this TV as I never heard of the Brand was planning to go for LG or Samsung but when on BBDS the pricing was for 42K and than Cherry on the Top flat 5K discount on HDFC card, finally got it at 37K, couldn't ask for more \ud83d\ude02\nTotal value for money amazing picture quality specially on Netflix and Youtube, movie watching experience is better when you connect Home theatre. Sound quality on the TV is OK but recommend you connect soundbar.\nOverall totally worth value for money \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",
            "Have explored Branded & Non-Branded but at this price & size nothing fits best then iFFALCON 4K UHD. Simply wao! Bit 4k quality, Sounds, connectivity....and to enjoy 4k video @2160 pixel you should have strong broadband/internet connection not hotspots through mobile.\nThose who still exploring go for it but don\u2019t forget to take 2 years extended Warranty provided by flipkart.",
            "Fantastic purchase.. I bought it in Big billion days with hdfc card I got massive discount and grab the deal...in short it's overall a good tv in terms of sound , picture quality in 4k as well as in hd . The only concern where it lacks in comparison of other tv brand is, it requires a wifi hotspot to which this tv and your mobile device simultaneously thats the biggest con. It should be improvise through updates as you can not connect your mobile directly (without internet) to ur tv ...pls bring an update to correct it otherwise it's a grab on deal \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",
            "The TV is good but not best! I think it would have been a better choice to buy Mi TV. The look and feel of TV is not very rich though in terms of features it has an edge.",
            "Over-all the tv is very good sound quality is very good , actually its a very big tv so keep that in mind . i am also having Vu 40\" led 4k and i have to say the picture quality of Vu is better than iffalcon the blacks in Vu are very good . but overall at this price iffalcon is also good",
            "Honest review after 15 days usage.\n\nPicture: for any one buying a 55k uhd tv, picture is the first parameter. Full he videos are nice to watch with appreciable upscaling to 4k. But 720p videos do look a bit odd..anything below 720p is not good. So always have a good internet connection and HD settop box for visual treats. 4k videos are mind blowing and a feast to watch.\n\nConnectivity: All ports work excellently. No issues.\n\nBluetooth: I connected my 2.1 audio, bt headphoneas. all working perfectly. no disconnections between.\n\nRemote: I liked the big remote...but air mouse remote is passable. Moreover u can control tv with ur mobile once connected to same wifi using Android TV app.\n\nSound: It is decent, vocals are very clear, some bass can be felt..overall better than expected\n\nCONS:\nStill running Android Nougat (7)\nNo promise about update\nGoogle play store doesn't have many supported apps.\nNetflix, YouTube work like charm but NO AMAZON PRIME APP OFFICIALLY.\nI side loaded Amazon prime app but it often crashes and tv reboots itself sending us into misery.\n\nOverall a great package for 36k...can't expect better.",
            "Amazing product.. it do support HDR and the picture quality is Awesome, No such lagging while playing 4k videos in YouTube & from external drive. Cool picture Quality & impressive Dolby atmos dts output.",
            "I have been planning to get big screen from long time was confused between mi tv at last have made best decision by buying iffalcon. Perfect Smart TV in this price range. delighted by it's picture quality, smooth Android experience and elegant design. both remotes are very slim and HDR 4k works perfectly fine and lastly for Big billion day deal 5 star rating to Flipkart.",
            "Jeeves are awesome . Got product installed within minutes of arrival. At this price range u cant get better. Hd picture is awesome. Sound quality is not for bass lovers but still clarity of sound is good. Sd quality looks somewhat ordinary. At the end of the day you will definitely love this tv.",
            "Fantastic TV ..... i bought it on sale....trust me guys...this TV 4k quality is stunning and gives pleasure to yours eyes....eveything abt this TV is royal....very good TV at this price range....buy this u ll forget all other brands. M super happy with this.",
            "Bought this TV after reading all reviews. It's good I got this for 37k which is pretty gud deal.. I was in dilemma to buy mi tv pro.or iffalcon, atlst I decided to buy this as Its 37k only where mitv pro was 45k. bought with 2yrs additional warrnty. Total I got it for around 40k..as of now picture quality and user interface is good no lagging, sound not clear but it not cons as led tvs don't have good sound. And Seems like technician installed this tv first time, he was confused little bit,.Edited bought tv on Oct, got 8 update on May month, full too dissappointed regarding price now it getting for 28k, but I bought it for close to 40k.",
            "installed on 20th Oct 2018 very nice in design and picture quality, sounds as well connectivity. I am fully satisfied with this tv with full option with affodable rate. I strongly recommend this tv. Thanks to flipkart and technician for the best service from ordering to till installation and demo.\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\ude4f",
            "all things are so so so good, thank you flipt cart awesome tv, but it's connectivity is poor like wifi,tv cast. I have 4 G jio fiber but it's round and round some time and disconnect frequently so please do need full, However all its good for me.",
            "Major issue for TV to start on Android. First 3 months were fine, post that taking 10 mins to start. Pay 10-15k more and buy a proven brand.\n\nNot 4K HDR on experience. Experience on a top of line Samsung or LG HD would be equal to 4K on this.\n\nSound quality is good enough, not spectacular.\n\nSo if looking for really good Smart TV experience this is not for you.",
            "Excellent tv with some default apps, tv looks nice and picture and sound quality is excellent, installation is also good with the guy but he purchased me a V gard mini crystal about 1650 rs after checking in online it\u2019s cost is 1150 so he charged me extra 500. I suggest to buy in online",
            "superb more than value for money....i saw some reviews regarding blurry picture after that I have two mind set buy r not to buy after that when it delivered I was surprised picture quality is really awesome iam using Videocon D2h HD BOX with normal SD channels nice quality picture as well as sound it's refreshing rate is 50hz @ 1080 may be for 4K videos it will be 60hz....\nFinal verdict without second thought any one can buy this....even it's big compitator for brands like SONY, LG, SAMSUNG.....",
            "valur for money smart tv ...better than 55 inch mitv .....i have both but clearly this is winner ....it even plays 1080p videos at very high quality.....dont think more about it ...you will just b proud of your decision",
            "nice deal 36999/ rs awesome clarity sound picture quality suprb better than mi tv",
            "After 2 yrs TV panel dead. Company warranty is over. And extended warranty from Jeeves no use as they said unable to repair the TV. As cost is too much. So don't but this waster of your hard earned money.",
            "I am writing this review after two days of installation,first of all installation was on same day ,nice job done by assigned guy.\nNow about TV ,it's truly a smart TV, connectivity is very smooth , picture quality is awesome , internet is necessary then only you can enjoy it fully....4k videos are like wooow!!\nFully satisfied till now...Just go for it!!!",
            "Received the TV on time as told. I had bought the TV on exchange hence the TV to be exchanged took lot of time to be examined. The people who come to pick up examine the TV as if they are buying a new TV from you. Also lot of questions asked about why selling TV and when was it bought etc etc\nComing to the TV, the TV was delivered in superb condition and it was opened and shown to me. I installed the TV myself as I am conversant with the procedure so no problem. Iffalcon by tcl is a great tv with great clarity. Bright and sharp colours and pictures. There is no difference between the display and sound of it and LG UHD smart TV which i also have. The installation is quick and easy if one has a wifi connection and google account. The android can be immediately installed throught your smartphone through google application. The android is fast and responsive\nHowever there are 2 points I would like TCL to correct in their next series. Firstly the TV takes more than a minute (about 1 minute 42 sec) to bootup and start. Secondly TCL should come up with magic remote as the normal remote does not have the capability to be used alongwith the set top box, and also the android application remote is not at all reliable.\nI would recommend to go for this TV as it is value for money. I m sure it is better than mi tv and cheaper too.\n\noverall score = 4.5/5",
            "Nice Products...\nI like this Led TV...\nAnd thanks to filpkart for great and fast delivery & installation...",

Only Issue: Android play store is having very limited option of Apps. Could have been more... No Option of installation of JIO Cinema Prine Video.... Netflix works awesome (U need good speed data connection for this).\n\nThe 4K upscaling is very good and gives new dimension to the TV.\n\nWorth buying at the price range. Must have for all....

Lol",
            "I must say, this is a great tv and the best one in this range. It is smart in true sense and the video quality is great. 4k video gives you a true colors and sound quality is also felt to be quite good. So a great deal in this range.",

You get a better picture quality, better sound quality, better live streaming.. just loved it. The only drawback is its service provider Jeeves, whose staffs are rude, unmannered, unprofessional and may dont fix ur problem as soon as u expect. Iffalcon should outsource its after purchase services with some other company instead of Jeeves.",
            "4k picture quality is mind blowing... clean and sharp even small hairs you can see... Full HD upscale algorithm also good. YouTube Works decent. T-cast app or any app for casting is sucks... more than 5mb picture file takes lot of time to load... even the picture viewer is not worth, it spoil the picture quality even if it's higher quality... so picture viewer needs more improvements... sound is loud in speaker... no problem in sound... overall TV wise it's best, smart TV wise it's should be much better in term of speed and lags... voice control I love it... it's work charm even Indian regional wordings(except some complicated) it will catch... worth for money in 55\" segment... TV bezel finish would have been better in size, its little big but OK manageable...",

HDR10 played flawlessly. But Android screen share (Chromecast) has some flickers.\n\noverall for the price it's worth the money and hope it outperforms Mi and VU Android (non HDR) in terms of performance.\n\nI've seen the reviews by fellow Flipkart users that the SD channels are not good.

            "Value for money. As of 2018 no other 55 inch TV in the price bracket of Rs.46k provides an Android based system with in-built Netflix and Youtube. The applications glide smooth and fast as in Android phones.\n\nBuilt quality of TV is sturdy. Picture is good with HD channels. Various preset picture modes are helpful and for those who wish to customise and explore, options do exist. Sharpness of picture may not be as good as that in a high end product but is acceotable. Unless one expects 5.1 channel quality sound, which is also rare in any other TV, it is acceptable. It connects seamlessly through HDMI Arc with 5.1 channel sound system.\n\nThe remotes are of satisfactory built quality and works well. The airmouse does it's job perfectly.\n\nWithin 7 days: I had issues with the hdmi ARC connectivity. Requested return. No response from Flipkart or TCL. Flipkart responded after the return period was about to expire and I had figured out the problem on my own. The issue still persists- hdmi arc port needs some fiddling to make it work. Port is loose.\n\nWithin 2 weeks: Whether TV switches \"ON\" is unpredictable.\n\nWeek 4: After groping with the Customer Care numbers, found a number which was working. Logged complaint and requested them to come on Saturday forenoon(as I would be available). They okayed the schedule.\n\n04/08/2018(Saturday): Called to confirm on Friday evening and Engineer visit scheduled to 2.30 pm.\n\nCalled at 2.30 pm: Engineer visit re-scheduled for 90 minutes later. As I had postponed other engagements till 3.00 pm and could not wait any more, the servicing has been requested for 9/08 or 10/08/2018. Complaint logging is only over phone. No visual messaging system.\n\nWill update review on the servicing if carried out satisfactorily.\n\nServicing: Engineer visit cancelled twice as the schedule was not convenient from both sides and Service provider could not provide slots after 6 pm.\n\nVisited assessed the fault and replaced a board. For the hdmi ARC, the Technician advised for replacement of the cable and on replacement of this on my part, sound output is fine and TV is now in perfect condition.\n\nThe bottom line is that unless one has access to the free services, purchase may lead to heartburn. For the price paid it definitely is a value for money TV.",

So, playstore is same as any high end android TV.\n2. You need to pair smart remote with TV for voice search and air mouse to work. For pairing press OK and back button together for few seconds and it will pair.\n3. After using any heavy app, I will advise to use TV guard app and do one key optimisation. It will make your experience smoother.\n\nEnjoy your TV!!",

Just Check the Images below and Go Wow. Wonderful Tv. Must Buy.",
            "Excellent TV. I liked the picture quality. However I am not an expert on picture quality. From a common point of view I was mesmerized by 4k videos in youtube. Too good. HD channnels looks great. But SD channels look bad. Hotstar videos looks extremely good. I am yet to try Netflix. TV looks good also. I am yet to figure out how to make the voice feature work in air mouse. TV takes around 1minute to switch on. Got it delivered and installed on the communicated dates. Overall looks great. I hope it is durable also. Felt like watching in a theatre as it is big. Sound quality is also fine.",

Even HD channels are at its best. it's just you won't enjoy SD channels so much but still these channels are watchable, will suggest you to have HD setup box before buying this TV to enjoy picture quality.\n\nTried using Google Chrome cast it works without lag and experience is good.\n\nAll the apps works very smoothly as RAM is 2.5gb. YouTube app can play 4k videos and even Netflix is just wow in this TV.\n\nThey gave pre-installed app of asphalt and playing that game in 55 inch is just best experience you will enjoy.\n\nInterface of home page is just simple and same as everyday mobile of Android.\nDefinitely suggest you to buy this TV if you want to use smart feature and enjoy the true 4k uhd.",

            "I had placed order for this TV with much anticipation, ultimately to get completely disappointed, with both Flipkart as well as the product. It seems everybody else is just happy with low price of big screen TV. I had complained about the problems in this TV, viz. Distorted sound on HD channels while using HDMI cable(screeching voices), no upscaling (in fact worse picture compared to FHD TV) of SD channels, Bluetooth remote not working properly, TV restarting while switching wifi connection and Chromecast working scratchy. Flipkart was fast to replace the first TV after technical evaluation. I received the second TV against pickup of first TV (that was great Flipkart). Got it installed on desktop and checked the above problems in front of installer cum demo guys. they again took the video of problems and I lodged complaint of REFUND with Flipkart on 5th Oct as now I am sure that these are inherent faults in the TV itself. On 7th, I received e mail from Flipkart that Return request CANNOT be fulfilled by the seller!! Now, who is the seller? its OmniTech Retail, ie Flipkart itself (sister concern, to be safe). They simply DIDN'T assign any reason for it. I certainly am going to raise this dispute further. If the product itself is FAULTY, how can Flipkart or seller or the Manufacturer deny REFUND???\nNow positives, delivery was fast but installation was rescheduled several times. HD channels look good on big screen, price is very good, sound is also very good with tabletop mount. Its got Google Play!!! Screen is not reflective. If you got 4K content, it looks good on this TV.\nAnd negatives - Don't have option to select USB in Input source selection, Wall-mount leaves no space behind TV to use HDMI and USB port situated at Back of the TV (side ones are accessible), same with Aux inputs.",

I have personally faced this issue and while Flipcart have washed their hand off, TCL the manufacturer do not have a solution to the problem in my TV as their technicians have no knowledge about the issue. After changing three times the motherboard and updating the software and 5-6 visits and spending at least 24 hours with my TV, they have been unable to fix the problem in my TV. Worst is the role played by Flipcart who after some initial support left me, a senior citizen at the mercy of TCL who have now stopped responding to my calls. My suggestion to all would be to boycott Flipcart who in their eagerness to increase their GMV are selling substandard products like iFFALCON TV which do not have a proper after sales support in India and they are the first to desert customers in case of any issue.",

Tv was hanging to wall and had no source of water falling on it. He argued saying, he doesn't know how water might go, but it's due to water falling on it, the LED pannel is damaged. He said it would cost 80% of the TV cost to replace it. Later when I appached the local technician, he got it fixed. I just payed 5k for it. Flipkart extended warranty is biggest fraud ever.

Everything is very good about this tv but cutting 1 star due to following reasons.\n\n- Double sound after connecting other devices. E.g. connection with home theatre- you need to manually reduce the sound of tv so that home theatre sounds comes in play. Ideally, it should switch automatically.\n- serious lag in sound on Bluetooth\n\nHope TCL can fix this with software update and hope these improvements can be shared with manufacturer.",

            "Overall TV features are good. Fully official Android. My First review .... I got faulty product. 1). At the time of installation, there was a problem with the sound. Technician tried switching off the TV at time of installation several times to identify the problem and suddenly the sound came. 2). It gets stuck while accessing the apps for example YouTube , you have to restart the tv or you should wait for few minutes to get it resolved. 3). Sometimes, AIR mouse does not work, you have to use it by just Using OK, up, down, left and right key, to come out of the stuck apps. 4). One of the major issue is, it gets restart automatically while watching TV. 5). There are few important apps are not available but I know that with this cost this much we can get. This issue I have been facing from the moment of installation 17th August . I had requested for replacement on 18th August(very next day after delivery and installation) but till now nothing has progressed. For my records, I have video recorded the problem in my phone, if required I can share the video with FLIPKART or any other services provider. But I am one of the Dissatisfied customer. I hope that FLIPKART will address my problem and resolve the issue by replacing the product......... This is my latest and second review, adding to my old review, I got new TV as a replacement of faulty product. Overall TV is stunning and excellent. Also FLIPKART has given the replacement within the given timeline. I would suggest buying this tv if you need excellent product with this price. Can be compared with branded TV. 5 star to IFFALCON and FLIPKART.",

Coming to the TV, there is noticeable bleeding across the top and bottom parallel to the top and bottom edges. Software and interface is very slow with log of lag. I doubt if it has 2.5 GB RAM. TV sometimes restarts by itself. HDMI ARC port of this TV does NOT work. Tried connecting the TV's HDMI ARC port with 2 different sound bars and 3 different cables. Doesn't work. Added to that, the Bluetooth of this TV doesn't work. It does not detect the soundbar. My 3 year phone connects to the soundbar by Bluetooth! This is definitely a regrettable purchases. I was attracted by the low price and the reviews. In hindsight, should have paid more for a more reputable brand like Samsung or LG.\n\n***Update Oct 2020 - the motherboard has failed twice - after 7 month in Jan 2020 and again in Oct 2020. The black remote has stopped working as well. You get what you pay for. Lesson learned.\n\nWarning on Flipkart extended warranty - it does NOT cover the remote. I paid for it thinking it was comprehensive and covered everything. Apparently it does not cover everything! TCL want Rs. 1800 for the black remote.",

Senior management is not looking at contacting customer for any issues raised to them.\n\nWhen I was planning to buy this tv it was giving 10% off for first time user and finally I was getting only Rs100 on Rs. 42k \ud83d\ude00. Really making fool of us by advt. of 10% off. I have been trying to get in touch with customer service and grievance officer Mr. Rajeev but no luck. Send multiple emails / calls but no response to it. That\u2019s the service I got from them.\n\nToday technician came and installed the TV but they were in lot of hurry. I don\u2019t know why they have been given too many calls to be addressed on one day. They cannot make justice to their job. It is not technician fault but again their boss who is expecting from him to work like robot.\n\nI hope correct message goes to senior folks of Flipkart .",

Net browsing is a pain on TV.... doesn't supports chrome...using maxthon browser....but it has bugs..very limited apps on Play store....tried to install other music apps like gaana but it's buggy...interface is very poor for the TV and there is LAG so much so that you just want to throw the remote.....other thing I noticed is that when instant on feature is on the apps starts to have hiccups particularly the gaming app...the race car freezes for seconds and again and again.... Thus for me this TV is only good for an average user who is into just watching TV, movies and you tube....other feature are there just for the Marketing business....For me the Android software on the TV has a poor implementation...and makes the TV buggy and painfully SLOW.",

They wont pick up the call, the website is useless and the NO response from the email.\n\nWhen you spend almost 40,000 Rs you expect the TV to be useful for at 7-8 years or at least 4-5 years. But to lose a TV where you save up 40k of your savings for just 1 year of use is just painful and absurd. I wish I could spend some more money to get a better brand.

All has started seeing this issue suddenly after 2+ years of usage. People have mostly bought this TV in 2018 from Flipkart and all of a sudden they all have flickering screen problem. Iffalcon team says since it's out of warranty, we need to pay the cost of panel change. We are putting together a list of people who have similar problems (12 till now) and will send to iffalcon higher authority. Refrain buying the TV from iffalcon for now. This brand is not trustworthy.\n******************\nI will update here how it goes with iffalcon team. Will keep updating if they resolve or not the issue.\n\nJune 11 ,2021 update\nIffalcon has deleted the Facebook post. They're not responding to our chat message. They aren't accepting it as manufacturing fault despite we have 25+ people who are having similar problems.\n\nWe are trying to make iffalcon team look into the issue. Will update here same.",

But there are cons also.\n\nafter my extensive use, I found following problems:\n1. Sudden crash & restart (mainly when you are opening side-loaded apps). suggest time to time close all background applications (by pressing home button for long time, all already opened apps will be visible in a row. remove all apps one by one except which you are currently watching) to keep memory clean.\n2. User manual : a copy is available out of the box, but not much use. you need to explore yourself for most of the troubleshooting.\n3. Audio output option. TV has 3 options. 1. 3.5 in audio jack (for headphone) 2. Bluetooth 3. SPDIF (Optical out). There is no Analog sound output port (A/V). HDMI port outputs (e;g, DTH, playstation) are ok though there is some delay between Video and Audio out. Bluetooth output to my Home theater (Sony) is a disaster. But for any videos from apps (e,g. Netflix ), via BlueTooth sound quality is very bad. Also there is huge delay. This need software update with immediate effect. But unfortunately there is no regular updates from Iffalcon, software product bug registration is not possible because TCL don't entertain Iffalcon TV related customer complains. But recently I used SPDIF (optical) port for output to my home theater. its superb. Changed my movie watching experience.",
