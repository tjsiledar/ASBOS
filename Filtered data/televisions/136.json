Magic remote has not been provided thats why we cannot use Alexa and Google voice assistant. You have to purchase magic remote.

            "I have looked for various brands and researched extensively before buying this tv. In short, for people looking for other options, this lg tv beats all other brands like hisense, mi, sansui, kodak, vu, blaunkpunkt, motorola, nokia, thomson etc. I have seen some of the tvs above mentioned by naked eye and no one comes close to this. Other brands boast of extensive features, but as they say they are all \"jack of all trades, but master of none\". Trust me, hdr on this tv is better than dolby vision on hisense. Only tvs that beat this are Sony and other lg, samsung oled tvs. So heres my experience after 10 days of use:\n\nPros:\n1. 4k clarity is really good. No complaints here. Works perfect.\n2. Upscaling is really good. SD and HD channels on set top box look clear and nice.\n3. Hdr works perfectly in prime video and netflix. No issues here (but you need to play with settings to acheive best of it)\n4. Has filmmaker mode, one of the best features, shows picture as is without any extra additions.\n5. App support is good. Bluetooth connectivity and network connectivity are fine, havent faced any issues.\n\nCons:\n1. The biggest con i would say for this tv is sound. It has 20w speaker, enough for a small room but not good enough for a big hall. Better buy a soundbar in that case.\n2. No magic remote, also couldnt get the magic remote app in playstore to work.\n3. LG installation and service are okay. Not upto the mark.\n4. Viewing angles are fine. I feel its VA panel, but viewing angles are not as bad as others. Unless you go to extreme sides, there may not be a problem. But hope lg would have provided IPS, which is LG is known for.\n\nOverall, Good tv. Go for it. If sound is your number one priority, \"AVOID\" this tv, youll surely be dissapointed.",

Good contrast ratio less then Samsung but still not too worst.\n4. Sound is superb for a medium size room.\n\nCons:-\n1. The panel used is not IPS, compromised viewing angle.\n2.

This is my fourth LG tv two are crts and it is now working in my brothers houses and the third was 32 inch smart fhd brought in 2013 and now sill in working confition. i reccoment LG tvs for durability and picture clarity. And also sound .\nThe web OS is very userfriendly and in this 2021 model Filmmaker mode is awesome experiance.

Flipcart gave big offer and very fast delivery it was a speedy delivery thanks to flipcart and LG.",

            "Got it during Big billion day sale at 36K including 2 year added Warranty so total warranty of product is now 5 years which is a secure deal considering Panel life if also not that much\u2026\n\nAt this price it is one of the best in the market considering all brand,\n\nYes Sony is the only brand which is better than LG and LG is 2nd best in the whole Television Market but Sony TV for same specifications will cost you above 50-55K which is too high..\n\nThus , it provides better experience at budget friendly price",
            "Sound and picture quality is excellent. Do not compare it with chaines brand and not go for less rating. Sound is crystal clear and enough for domestic use. Overall this TV is very good. One thing is to be noted that screen contrast and sharpness is more better than chaines products and screen life of chaines products are becoming faint after use 4-5 year I feel it in MI TV. Just concept of led bulb that 6 month use its light become lesser than compare new one.\nInstallation part is poor and I think local service centre who brings wall mount bracket (not provided in TV box) is wrost product because there is two type of wall mount instruments one is moving in all directions with for and ahead also buy I have provided with moving left and right only. I call to customer care also and he replied me kindly raise issue with local service provider. Demo part is also poor it seems he has not time and he just came for TV installation. LG has to look into matter.",
            "Great experience. Wonderful picture quality and good sound quality. No issue with grey uniformity. Good viewing angles. Good upscaling capability of tv. Natural colors. And use expert mode for less strain to eyes!",

            "Very nice product. But comes without magic remote. I am still in a dilemma that i will get magic remote to purchase separately or not. Local LG service centre doesn't have stock, even said this model is not compatible with magic remote. Flipkart customer care doesn't know about it. LG customer care is confirming that magic remote will work. So am still confused. Otherwise product is amazing.",
            "Rest everything is good except magic remote is not available with this model and Tv panel is not IPA. sound quality is best.",
            "Nice Smart TV must purchase. It's my first smart TV and I checked each & everything working fine as of now. Screencast working smoothly. You can make your smartphone your magic remote for this Smart TV. Overall I liked it and thanks to LG for keeping the trust.",
            "Very nice picture and sound qualitied. WebOS is not upto the mark, very clumsy, needs to simplify like Android and need to add frequently used apps like JioTV",
            "I would not say that the TV is best but if you\u2019re looking for a budget TV.. go for it. The 4k and HD quality is good and you will enjoy it. Sound is obviously not you can expect to the level of Sony but ok. Connect it from your BT speaker and enjoy. The delivery and installation was super fast. The same was done within 12 hours of my placing the request.",
            "Superb picture quality and web os software is quite good and much improved.\nUltra HD 4k video clarity is awesome and it's quite clear that LG is best in technology. The only area where LG need to improve is sound quality. I can say sound quality is good but not that much great. Anyway a superb TV which is absolutely value for money",
            "Magic remote should have been part of purchased item. Otherwise i am very much satisfied in other aspects. Well built and good picture quality tv.",
            "Picture quality excellent as expected from LG.\nSound quality very good but after connecting with bluetooth speaker of ANT audio , speaker sound was not at all being played and 60 w speaker sound was performing like 10 watt.\nOnly disappointment lack of magic remote which LG must supply with the TV. I would request LG to provide to all customer magic remote .\nThanks to Flipcart for Fast delivery\nThanks to Flipcart and LG for fast installation.",
            "The picture and sound quality is excellent. TV's picture upscale capability is really good. Can use SD set-top box and TV will upscale it really good. Sound quality with 20 watt speaker is really good. You won't need soundbar or additional speakers even for larger rooms.",
            "Picture quality is excellent and many times better than Mi/Sansui and other local brands. Always go for brands like LG/ Samsung /Sony if your pocket allows.Excellent service provided by Flipkart and LG team. Happy with the product.",
            "Very very Happy with lg 55UP75 model\nAfter researching of many TV's and reviews finally i chose Lg UP75 and after delivery of the item i am really happy with this product and i felt it's perfect choice in 55inches segment and i am sure it will never disappoint you and\nI give rating for this tv\nFirst of all\nTo the Package and delivery i give \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\nPicture quality and web OS \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\nInstallation done same day \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\nLg Service \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\nDisplay \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\nPanel - IPS Panel gives Amazing Viewing Angles \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\nValue for Money \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\nIt's an amazing Tv in 55inch segment and coming to the LG brand just go for it without any hesitation and don't compare with other brands and no other brands give great customer service like LG.\n\nThanks to Flipkart and seller",
            "Delivery was on time\n\nTV was installed on time but installed on fixed wall mount and we can not move the tv to access various ports which are on the back. We have to unmount the tv every time to access the port which is risky. LG should provide installation on flexible wall mount for TV's which have ports on the back.\n\nSoftware response is slow. It takes about 6-10 seconds even to open settings after pressing the button on remote.\nSmart TV without a voice command remote again disappoints. Such very basic function should not be compromised for cost cutting.\n\nBut overall satisfied with the brand for providing 50\" this tv at lowest possible price.I purchased it at 45K after discounts and offers.",
            "Overall it is a good TV witn IPS panel. Picture quality is good. Sound is good. A very good buy in this price.\nLife's Good",
            "I bought it during sale for my bedroom. I already have a 55 inch samsung 8 series tv so i will compare with it on some points.\nCons:\n1. Remote quality is not good. Although it works fine but the buttons feel very cheap and distinction between buttons are not good.\n2. Hotstar does not support 4k\n3. NO DOLBY VISION\n4.Only 2 usb ports\n5.Medium bezel design although it looks good\n6. Colour washout is little kore than my samsung tv which has same va panel but for a room that is acceptable\n\nPros\nThere are many pros and these overshadows cons by far\n1. Awesome picture quality. Much better than those budget brands like vu and mi. I looked at those tv at stores and this tv had much better colour.picture quality is even slightly better than my samsung tv\n2. Motion blur control is very good on this tv. While watching cricket it is pretty evident. Its much better than samsung\n3. Aound quality is very good for small room. I hardly play it above 20. Might be little less for a hall.\n4. Best part is webos of lg. Its very well optimised ans very fast. Much better than tizen os of samaung and definitely better than laggy android. With the thinQ app of lg you can even use your phone as remote. Apple airplay worls flawlessly and without lag. App opening is super fast and it supports 5Ghz wifi too.\n5. Colour profile presets are very good. Flimmaker mode looks awesome on ott contents.\n6. Playing content from pen drives is very smooth and with very good upscaling",
            "Happy customer by use of one month",
            "Picture quality is excellent\nColors ar natural and not so vibrant. Color temperature is really controlled well.\nSettings of audio and video has several modes of your choice. I really soke the cinema mode audio. It creates very lod and clear sounds for movies and music.\nSpeakers are so loud that you might not need home theatre.\n\nI tried it with Wifi connecting to Airtel Xtreme fiber. It runs buttery smooth.\n\nAlso I tried it with HD channels on Airtel DTH. The quality of picture and audio is excellent.\n\nCons:\nSD channels are waste of money. Don't even try to watch SD channels on 50+ inch tv.",

            "If you want better picture quality then this is not right for you. I don\u2019t know whether I only observed this is there someone also observed but not given review. The panel of this tv is VA panel which is hidden by LG as well as Flipkart. If you see at 90 degrees then only this tv looks ok. If you deviate little bit 10 degrees away from tv you will lot of white shade entire tv looks so whitish and it is not even comparable by normal Full HD tv\u2019s. Such a worst product. Please don\u2019t waste your money. Once you brought this then you will regret. Even Flipkart service is terrible if you reach out them with your concern. And LG technicians says this tv is manufactured like that we don\u2019t do anything. In the end your money throwing in drainage.",
