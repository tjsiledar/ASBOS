            "So I bought this TV last week. And I already knew the why and what of this product. Why to buy it and what to expect out of it. Actual user experience is of one week.\nKodak's CA series is one of the best range of LED Television that the company has put out, competing directly against the likes of VU, Redmi, Motorola, TCL..etc.\nSo let's get straight into why and what -\nWhy - Because it's a purely made in India product which can compete and win against some of the best in this price range when compared feature to feature.\nI had two concerns with this model. First it has single band wifi that will only connect with 2.4Ghz signal (I thought for streaming 4k videos you need to have 5ghz wifi frequency which will require Dual Band wifi which comes with additional cost), and second the storage is 8 GB out of which only 3.7 GB is available for use.\nHave been streaming 4K videos without any lag whatsoever over 2.4 GHz wifi. So that solves the connectivity issue.\nSecondly, being an android TV, it easily allows you to setup pen drive (remember to use USB 3.0) as a storage for apps. I am using a 32 GB Kingston Swivl pendrive which cost around 600rs. So this solved the storage issue. And hence my why was justified.\n\nNow what to expect out of this model -\n\nPicture quality - as good as any other brand in this price range and even higher. (Not comparing with LGs, Samsung's and the Sony's)\nSound quality - as good, if not better, than other brands in this price range.\nProcessor performance - more than enough for my requirements - UHD/4K streaming of OTT contents and XBOX gaming.\nCustomer service - Yet to experience it but guys from Kodak called me and asked me if the TV is working fine and also shared the customer care number and promised on site support. I live in Gurgaon. Customer care experience can vary from place to place.\n\nBased on actual user experience I can say that this TV has proved to be more than what I had expected.\n\nA pure value for money buy!",

            "So I bought this TV last week. And I already knew the why and what of this product. Why to buy it and what to expect out of it. Actual user experience is of one week.\nKodak's CA series is one of the best range of LED Television that the company has put out, competing directly against the likes of VU, Redmi, Motorola, TCL..etc.\nSo let's get straight into why and what -\nWhy - Because it's a purely made in India product which can compete and win against some of the best in this price range when compared feature to feature.\nI had two concerns with this model. First it has single band wifi that will only connect with 2.4Ghz signal (I thought for streaming 4k videos you need to have 5ghz wifi frequency which will require Dual Band wifi which comes with additional cost), and second the storage is 8 GB out of which only 3.7 GB is available for use.\nHave been streaming 4K videos without any lag whatsoever over 2.4 GHz wifi. So that solves the connectivity issue.\nSecondly, being an android TV, it easily allows you to setup pen drive (remember to use USB 3.0) as a storage for apps. I am using a 32 GB Kingston Swivl pendrive which cost around 600rs. So this solved the storage issue. And hence my why was justified.\n\nNow what to expect out of this model -\n\nPicture quality - as good as any other brand in this price range and even higher. (Not comparing with LGs, Samsung's and the Sony's)\nSound quality - as good, if not better, than other brands in this price range.\nProcessor performance - more than enough for my requirements - UHD/4K streaming of OTT contents and XBOX gaming.\nCustomer service - Yet to experience it but guys from Kodak called me and asked me if the TV is working fine and also shared the customer care number and promised on site support. I live in Gurgaon. Customer care experience can vary from place to place.\n\nBased on actual user experience I can say that this TV has proved to be more than what I had expected.\n\nA pure value for money buy!",

            "I have been using this tv for the past 5 months, so these are my thoughts:\n1. Picture quality is very good, can play 720p videos without any blurry effects. Dont recommend to watch 480p videos since the clarity will be less but still watchable.\n\n2. Sound is ok if u r in a quiet room, but with external noises it will be hard to hear unless you hav a external speakers or any other setup\n\n3. Connectivity is good, i am using jiofi to stream all the content, hav not faced a issue. Only having 2.4ghz connection though.\n\n4. OTT services like prime, disney+, netflix, content is good to watch with the HDR effects.\n\n5. (Major issue) Everyone's in a while tv will turn of automatically while watching any content ( not app specific). I have encountered around 10 times till now. NOT SURE IF ITS SOFTWARE ISSUE OR HARDWARE ISSUE. but it kills the experience.\n\n6. Remote is ok but sometimes the response might be slow, while turning on the tv ,mostly.\n\nPlease note: After purchasing this tv, will get a call from the representatives from Kodak telling that they wll extend the tv warranty by extra 6 months if we put good comments about the product and whatapp them the screenshot.",
            "Update-Review after a couple of month's usage:\n\n> The HDR is stopped working via HDMI( tested with ps4 and gtx 1650). Netflix dolby vision works.\n> The remote stopped worki g properly after 2 months. Support center wont troubleshoot propely. They asks for video proof constantly rather than understanding the issue. They won't event hint how to buy a new remote.\n> The customer service only works in the first week to get a high rating and slowly they wont care after it.\n>Cannot enjoy tv properly due to the misbehaving remote(automatically returns to home/skips content. Changed battery 3 times. Battery is not the issue)\n\nFirst Impressions:\n\nMy previous TV was VU 43inch fHD tv. 3 years old. The colors were bright washed, the gradient banding was high. The sound output below average.\n\nAt Present:\n\nAfter a weeks usage i would say the experience is good. Like its worth the pay, but not perfect (if you like to nitpick). But as a fily driver it performs and wont let you down.\n\nDisplay:\n\nThe display is good, there are slight gradient banding but wont affect the experience.\nThe blacks are deep. But the overall gamma is cold(can be adjusted)\nWhen viewed from sides, small blueish tint is experienced(may be gamma thing!!).\n\nSometimes the colors gets over saturated or flushed out. (Have to fiddle with settings to correct these)\nTested HDR with PS4, it does make a difference in gaming.\n\nDolby vision: there are a couple of movies/series in Netflix that support. Tested and works.\n\nRemote TV connectivity: update: dies very quickly, un reliable.\n\nWhen switched on, takes a little time for the remote to pair up and initialize or so. For a few mins the controls will lag, after 2 mins things will become smooth.\n\nSound:\n\nThe tv speaker is moderate. It does the job and way better than my old VU.\nConnected my 2.1 using toslink, the output is good(supports pcm and Dolby digital)\n\nHaven't tested hdmi arc's performance and support.",

            "Hi, Writing this review after 19 days of usage. I always believed in the myth that TV means we should go for Sony, Samsung or LG. But the myth is finally busted. I am the proud owner of Kodak 65 inch 4K UHD TV. I cannot be we can get such a big master piece at 49K which is the cost of most of mobile phones today. It is absolutely 5 star in every aspect of technical spec.. With all the anti china sentiments around, it is perfect time to bring home a product Made in India by a very old TV manufacturing Indian company. Not sure why people should go for major brand like Sony when we have everything and more in our Indian made brand at such a competitive price. I would say just close your eyes and click the BUY button, because I have done all kind of research before buying this master piece.\n\nI honestly request Kodak to make 75 and 85 inch TVs. I will be the first one to buy a 85 inch TV if they launch. If you ask me, every Indian should support this brand for their honest efforts in selling such a class product at this price. I used Sony 55 inch for last 5 years, this product beats Sony in every minute technical spec. I did quite a bit of research before finally settling on Kodak 4K TV. I myself is proud of my decision. Just go for it and say final good bye to all Chinese companies like mi, OnePlus, realme etc.,",
            "Would definitely recommend this TV to everyone. Value for money. Picture quality and sound are extremely impressive. It has in built chomecast and Google assistant which makes it more easy to use. So happy with this purchase.",

            "This is the best TV as far as price is concerned. It's worth. Life of all LED TVs are 5 years irspective of brand. Earlier branded CRT TVs was working good for 20-25years but now in this use and throw era better not to invest in branded TVs because life of all TVs are 5 years only.",
            "Compact, easy to use, good picture quality. Sound is good enough for a small room and easily connects via bluetooth to sound systems if needed. Works well as a desktop monitor too. So far, it has been a value for money product.",

            "Writing this review after 3 days usage of a 50\" TV-\nPros -\na. Delivery and installation were done within the given time frame\nb. The picture quality is very good, you don't see any pixels even from a 4 feet distance.\nc. Android works pretty well, connects quickly with OTT platforms (used with PrimeVideo and Hotstart).\nd. Bezels are very thin, even the bottom one is just wide enough to show a Kodak logo.\ne. 1.75 GB RAM works fine, I don't see any lags even while watching part of fast action movies like Aquaman, Avengers, or any dance sequences.\nf. Works very well even with the hotspot network of my mobile. Watched 20-25 minutes of a movie on hotstar using my network mobile, and there was hardly any lag.\n\nCons -\na. Sound quality is okay, certainly has some room for improvement. Good thing is that it doesn't distort even at max volume.\nb. If I unplug the TV then I have to tune the TV again, which takes almost 3-4 minutes. I think it's more an android thing, rather than Kodak, or maybe I am missing something.\nc. Build quality can be improved - If I go very near to the TV, on the sides I can see a gap between the front-panel and back-screen. Thinking if I should report and ask for fix/replacement.",

            "Two days back i purchased the kodak TV with lot of confusions but all my doubts cleared with this after watching for 4 to 5 hrs continously .\nAwesome experience in picture clarity\nSupporting apps also super\nVery little lag from moving to another app but i felt it is because we are new in changing modes in remote .\nWe satisfied with this product .\nThanks to Kodak and seller for the wonder ful product\nI will give a review after one month of usage .",
            "Excellent TV for the price range. Picture quality is really amazing and sound is good. It has a decent build quality, but it feels a bit delicate.\nAndroid interface is good, but not as responsive as fire TV stick. Google assistance experience was not very good, it is not very responsive, sometimes you need to repeat the instructions multiple times.\n\nOverall experience has been good and I will definitely recommend this TV, if you are looking for a UHD in budget range.",
            "Good buy.. Getting an ultra HD 4k decent tv for 22 k is a great feeling.Its up to the mark while comparing with other costly brands.. Picture quality is good and it provides a wondeful sound experience . Smart features are working perfectly. No issues at all in wifi and mobile connectivity . Google Assistant and Chromecast are working perfectly. I also took 3 year warranty from flipkart.. Installation was done on the very next day itself and their service was good too..",
            "Have been using this TV for the past one week now. Its quite early to write a review. With my experience till now, I am very much happy with the product. Its as good as the costly brands which we see in the market.\nVery happy with the product till now. Good picture quality, sound quality and connectivity.",
            "Delivered on time and installation done on the next day. nice service from Flipkart. Service engineer did his job very well. T V is marvelous.At this price range Kodak is the best one.Nice picture quality and Dolby sound works well. Easy connect to Wi-Fi and Chromecast. Use low data for playing YouTube and jio cenema. Afterall Android pie is nice to use as your Mobile phone. No need to use cable connection. Use it as your Mobile phone. Every thing is fully satisfied. good job Flipkart. Big Salute...",
            "Pros: Good Picture Quality, better than many like TCL qled , Sansui and other brands , it can match Sony with adjustments. Reason is simple Good quality IPS panel\nSound is really good specially when u put on DTS settings.\n4k display is excellent\nBezel less display so design wise very good.\nCons\n1. It doesn't support Dolby Vision but it is listed , on company site it's not there but there is not much content available for Dolby Vision.\n2. It doesn't have Dolby Atmos but can recognise Dolby Audio input and support sound effects.",
            "Best value for money. Bluetooth range for my headset is very short, only con I noticed, but wifi reception is very good. Booting time need to be improved in future updates, its decent now. UI is responsive and easy.\nRemote control not working after 1 month. Got fixed but took almost 2 months to get a new one.\n(review based on first day usage, will edit here if any issues?)",
            "Awesome purchase! Amazing picture quality at this price, sound is very good. Borders are thin, design is simply elegant even the power light is not irritating to eyes.\nUser interface is friendly because of Android.\nMore settings and many modes for pictures are given. Hotkeys are available on remote to access Netflix, Prime Video, YouTube and Google Play easily. Installation was also done on time.",
            "Superb.....Amazing value for money tv......superb from KODAK.......Even SD channels are good to watch ....and if u are watching online content like on youtube with a good data connection ...the picture quality is like any other top brands sony or samsung .....",

            "Overall performance of tv is good and picture quality is good but aux jack is not giving to connect home theatre u have to connect with Bluetooth or optical to hdmi arc tv is sooo good 5/5",
            "It's very nice reasonable product in the market. Gives nice opportunity for viewing experience in 4k and HD Quality video's but laser in SD videos. Sound quality some how not that much good. Connectivity to fast with blutooth, WiFi and HDMI cables. I purchased 50 inch TV with 1 year warranty which is quite less for trust. You need to extend warranty for better caring of your applince.",
            "Nice TV with Android supporting apps.\nOnly thing that is lacking is sound quality, it should have been much better as you cannot enjoy songs if you are music lover. Sound as compared to LG is nothing there with Kodak. Other than the sound there is nothing else that I should be complaining off. Kodak please work on your sound system.\nDelivery was proper and installation was also quick and the person made us understand how to use the remote as well.",
            "Wonderful TV, worth every penny\n\nWhat a Wonderful TV , I bought this one in last week. bought this one after comparing different brands at this price segment.

After pressing 3 to 4 times it is responding rest all everything is awesome in this tv I can say.",
            "Good value for money, picture is of a decent quality and brightness, it has good features with Android TV OS and plentiful connectivity. Only thing missing is a standard 3.5mm jack (although optical gives better sound output) and the inbuilt speakers are a little bit of a let down (which inbuilt speakers aren\u2019t right?). Happy with the purchase, the delivery and the service so far.",
            "Superb tv, fabulous\nSuper tv awesome image even without hd connection.true Dolby atoms sound. Extraordinary picture quality. Mind blowing sound. Thin bezel design.

            "I am writing this review after usage of 5 days. I will try to be detailed with least possible words ;)\n\n1. Picture Quality - It's decent given the price at the same time don't expect it to BRAVIA level. Color repro is also good and white/black is also repo'd well. Though the viewing angle is not that great. You would want to sit around 130~140 instead of 170ish as mentioned.\n2. Sound Quality - This TV is loud and can produce decent mid and highs. Dont expect to produce good low's.\n3. Product Quality - That's questionable as in my TV unit, I can see gaps between screen and it's base. Interestingly, it's not interfering with picture quality or with colors.\n4. Apps - YouTube started crashing on 3rd day. Though, rest are loading fine.\n\nAs mentioned in title it's a decent product give the price. I will try update the review after some more usage.",
            "Quality is hell good picture and surrounded sound, premium remote with hot keys like Netflix, YouTube,prime video, playstore and remote is made of aluminum and glosy plastic gives premium feeling ,worth buying 50\" 4k UHD HDr10 TV go for it. Sound is of top quality Dolby digital DTS assurround Sound , from 30 watt 3 speakers, new Android 10, mediatek processor, wifi 2.4,Bluetooth 5.0 latest, I can download from 5000+ app from playstore from t.v. it got inbuilt google search hot key too, internet connectivity of this Tv is very fast good, even I can play YouTube video from my mobile Hotspot and we can connect so many Bluetooth ,wifi devices.",
            "sound Quality and picture is excellent, thank you flipkart for delivering wonderful product. but i am not happy with wall mount provided with tV its not getting fit because of that i am using table stand.",
            "Good One ActualLy..WorTh For This Price. Its Comes With Table Stand Which is Better. So It Dosent Require That You Should Wall Mount. If You Have Internet Connectivity In Home Then This Tv Is ReallY WorTh BuYing. You Can Browse nd Access EverYthing You WisH For. ChroMeCastiNg Works PerFecT No Matter, What Videos You Watch in Your Mobile You Can CasT It With Your Tv And SiT Back and Watch RelaxedLY. Even For Gaming Such as PlasyStation 4 Is Also Awesome. So At this Price Range You Can Go For KodaK Tv!!",
            "Nice Product from Kodak at this price range.\nIt has an Amazing display. Sound quality could have been better but cannot ask more at this price range. Overall a very good quality with an aggressive pricing.",
            "I bought 65inch Kotak. This is my second 65inch TV. I purchased the second one after a year from first one. I am quite impressed with Picture quality. Good price range for this size of TV. Flipkart delivered it on time and installation was very good as I have to do wall mounting.",
            "A good value product for the cost. The product arrived one day before schedule, neatly packed. The installer immediately followed up and it was installed on the same day. Picture quality is good. I could watch my favorite videos in 4K quality through you tube. But you must have a good Data plan. Else switch to HD or lower quality. I was a bit worried about the sound quality but I could adjust the settings to switch off the system sound and keep only the surround sound ON. After doing this, I really enjoyed listening to lot of music videos. A user friendly remote with a voice search assistant. I liked the product very much. The only con being the wall mounting stand could have been of extendable type.",
            "This was a great deal ofcourse at this price especially, kodak amazes us with its immense picture quality(comparable to some mediocre and premium brands ) and sound effects from Dolby , connectivity and other android features are all great, Google voice assistant is also responsive. Yet there were some flaws that I could identify such as the design and build quality , when the tv is wall mounted it's difficult to reach the usb, hdmi and av ports as they are placed at the centre of the back panel. It's manageable but quite annoying sometimes. The build quality is not very good but it does satisfy us. The screen is very close to being bezel less. The 1.75 GB ram does it's job , I wouldn't say it's very fast , but yeah it's fast enough , the 8GB internal memory was a disappointment because we cannot install a lot of apps , yes we can add an external memory support , but some apps cannot be installed on usb. The product is actually the greatest we can get at this price range. Installation was done within 4 days of delivery. Overall performance: works like a charm. :)\nEdit:\nThe remote had some issues after approx. 1 month of purchase, I contacted customer care and their service is not very satisfactory. Haven't received remote yet and the process to get it is very complicated.",

            "I was little hesitant to buy a non famous brand and since I wanted to avoid the Chinese brand, I researched online and got few options like Kodak and Nokia. Then on the budget constraints I went for Kodak. I purchased few months back and I had no compliance and it works beautifully. Specially the brightness and the sharpness is too good. Sound is also very good. Keep the good work guys.\n\nOne small suggestion from my side is the wire connector. If there is an option to have a 90 digree bent plug, it will be good to have the plugs connection hidden behind the TV. I had attached the picture of the plug black of the TV.",
            "Its been two weeks now that i have bought this TV and i have the best experience so far. Top quality at affordable prices.",
            "Review after 9 months: Simply awesome. Awesome picture quality: the clarity, the true color rendering, the vivid and lifelike colors, the great contrast, the rich black color resulting in great dark scenes. I used to have a plasma TV before and this comes very close as far as true black is concerned.\nGreat sound: Nothing like you've heard before on earlier LED TVs. I mostly use the sound through my music system via the optical channel to get true digital/Dolby experience, but am impressed by ...\nREAD MORE",

Thin Bezel. You hardly notice the tv frame.\n3. Adequate space between the tv and wall when mounted.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Sound Quality. Its good, not the best, but if you have an external speaker or soundbar, then trust me, the TV watching experience is very good.\n2. 2.4GHz Bluetooth band.

            "Excellent TV in this price range, you get HDR10, Dolby Vision, MEMC, After lot of searching finally settled on this model.\n550 nits of brightness & high contrast ratio makes the picture look quite punchy.\nRemote control is also very good as you can control VLC/MX player & KODI from it\n4K videos are treat to the eyes, also high bit rate 720p & 1080p videos look nice.\nFor DTH HD channels look awesome & SD channels are also watchable\nOverall best value for money TV & last but not the least a made in India product",

            "every thing is nice 1) picture 2) sound 3) connectivity another thing it will be batter if some thin blaze is incorporated in this tv, otherwise some glue stickr like cellotape is sticking there to keep the pannel (display) attached with body ( back side). thank u kodak tv.",
            "As a basic smart tv is good but you won\u2019t get camera option in app settings. Hence u can\u2019t connect zoom with cam. No point of meeting without cam and smart tv of no use in lockdown where we have online classes and meetings.",
            "Great display panel quality at this price. Minor light bleeding towards the left hand side corners.\n\nSound is just okay - doesn't feel like 30W speakers. My panasonic with 30W speakers is much louder, crisper, and overall has a better balance.\n\nThe tv is very light and the build quality is okay for this price. Do not expect flex-free solidness.\n\nThe user interface is stock android tv 9. So that's good! Hopefully it'll get updates to at least android tv 10 and 11 in the life cycle of the product.\n\nThe remote is great if you have a live tv source. It's a big remote.\n\nIf you only watch content from streaming services, you might want to get a smaller smart remote and pair it with the system. Something more like the remote on a mi box 4k or fire tv stick.\n\nThe mount provided with the tv was extremely flimsy and not worth it. I paid the installation person rs.1500 and bought a new proper adjustable mount from him which looked a lot more solid.",

            "Smart TV at this price is certainly incredible. This is Android and true 4k experience with excellent sound with expected bass. Remote Interface is too good to move around and voice commands through google assistant makes the entertainment hassle free and smoother. This can easily be compared with leading brands and I would rather say nothing could be expected beyond within this price range.",

            "Quality and design of TV is horrible & faculty. Line started appearing on screen within one year of use. Interface is very slow and connectivity of the TV with internet is very poor. Most important fact that they don't even have their own service Centre. They sent flipkart personal who was not even a technician, he simply took photo of TV & sent to someone. Their is no physical damage either on screen nor on body of TV, However, flipkart personal said it's internal crack and not covered in warranty. I said how internal crack can develop without any physical damage either on screen or body of TV that's means it's due faulty design of TV and should be covered in warranty. He said you speak to manufacturer.\nSo please think twice before buying any products of Kodak brand as their quality and design is faulty and prone to to defects that they will not covered in warranty. Further their service Center network is very poor and also they don't even cover defects developed during transit from or to their service centre.",

You will notice the difference, the clarity, color representation is brilliant.\nJust another day was watching Sherlock on Netflix, and I was amazed to see clarity and details. Although you need a good connection and Netflix UHD subscription to truly enjoy the feel. Audio is A-Okay. Wont recommend using Dolby surround without speakers, sound can be customised so you can choose it according to your convenience. Dont forget to adjust gamma as per surroundings.\nTV is quite responsive, boots up quickly and apps run smooth. Casting is pretty easy and google assistant works perfectly.",

Thanks Flipkart for the quick service.\n2. Picture Quality - 4K as well as HD picture qualities are extremely good. Even the SD channels are producing a decent view due to up-scaling. You can watch the TV from every angle due to it's IPS panel. There is no motion blur due to the MEMC feature. You can enjoy fast moving scenes without any issue.\n3. Sound : Sound quality is quite descent for moderate room size. Better than other TVs of this price range. You may have to add external speaker, depending upon your requirements.\n\nOverall- quite satisfied. Recommend all to buy this TV due to it's overall features at this affordable price. There was a a price drop of Rs1000/- after my purchase. However, Flipkart/Kodak have refunded Rs1000/- to my Flipkart a/c as a goodwill gesture. Really appreciate the same.",

Picture quality.\nBefore buying this tv, my main entertainment was my mobile which has oled display. When you come to this rv from oled display you will feel very disappointed. You can see a whitish fade on the screen always. Also my parents have a 10 year old Lg lcd tv which outperforms this display on terms of picture quality. There is no micro dimming in this product which is certainly a drawback.\n\n2. No 5ghz wifi receiver( contradictory to what is mentioned in kodak website)\n\n3. Very difficult navigation for tv settings and very restricted android features(you cant write/delete files to a usb disk)\n\n4. The native prime video app hangs all the time when you fast forward or rewind\n\nOverall i would say the product quality is no more better than the price we pay.Got it for 25691 on sale. If i was offered another chance and more money, i would have taken an lg smart tv and an android tv box seperately.",

Even cheaper brands provides these informations.\nAndroid software also not very user friendly. There is no clear selection for sound output.\nHDMI ports are provided with option of renaming the port, instead of providing ARC/CEC controls. This feature is useless.\nDue to poor technical support, I replaced one tv with flipkart. The replaced one is working good. But HDMI ARC port problem doesn't resolved completely. I have to remove HDMI cable from STB once and after sometime again put on STB and then ARC functioning properly.\nI am using this TV with Sony Home Theater, HTRT3 with HDMI connectivity.",

It's been over 8 days 4 calls n email from my first complain n the promised Technical team will call back in 24hrs not happening. They r living upto Make in India work no service.\n\nA word of caution when taking the 3 yrs extend warranty it looks lovely when u glance at it.But when u get intouch with flipkart it looks like a big scam by Flipkart.\nFlipkart will give u a invoice n not give u the details list of terms n conditions of the warranty which is on the website. I have tried following up for the terms of the warranty copy n spoke to over 20 executives who have no clue about the terms on the site n have practically refused to give the details in writing. Last person to speak with me introduced himself As Sr Executive Junet saying he has the authority to solve the problem. Sr Ex Junet was not even aware of the over 10 pg warranty terms n point black said flipkart will not give it n he can cancell the warranty if I keep insisting for the copy. That was his wonderful solution.\n\nBravo flipkart great way to handle a customer request for a copy of a document in public domain on your website. Keep the good work going Cheers",

            "So I bought this TV last week. And I already knew the why and what of this product. Why to buy it and what to expect out of it. Actual user experience is of one week.\nKodak's CA series is one of the best range of LED Television that the company has put out, competing directly against the likes of VU, Redmi, Motorola, TCL..etc.\nSo let's get straight into why and what -\nWhy - Because it's a purely made in India product which can compete and win against some of the best in this price range when compared feature to feature.\nI had two concerns with this model. First it has single band wifi that will only connect with 2.4Ghz signal (I thought for streaming 4k videos you need to have 5ghz wifi frequency which will require Dual Band wifi which comes with additional cost), and second the storage is 8 GB out of which only 3.7 GB is available for use.\nHave been streaming 4K videos without any lag whatsoever over 2.4 GHz wifi. So that solves the connectivity issue.\nSecondly, being an android TV, it easily allows you to setup pen drive (remember to use USB 3.0) as a storage for apps. I am using a 32 GB Kingston Swivl pendrive which cost around 600rs. So this solved the storage issue. And hence my why was justified.",

First it has single band wifi that will only connect with 2.4Ghz signal (I thought for streaming 4k videos you need to have 5ghz wifi frequency which will require Dual Band wifi which comes with additional cost), and second the storage is 8 GB out of which only 3.7 GB is available for use.\nHave been streaming 4K videos without any lag whatsoever over 2.4 GHz wifi. So that solves the connectivity issue.\nSecondly, being an android TV, it easily allows you to setup pen drive (remember to use USB 3.0) as a storage for apps. I am using a 32 GB Toshiba pendrive. So this solved the storage issue. And hence my why was justified.\n\nNow what to expect out of this model -\n\nPicture quality - as good as any other brand in this price range and even higher. (Not comparing with LGs, Samsung's and the Sony's)\nSound quality - as good, if not better, than other brands in this price range.\nProcessor performance - more than enough for my requirements - UHD/4K streaming of OTT contents and XBOX gaming.\nCustomer service - Yet to experience it but guys from Kodak called me and asked me if the TV is working fine and also shared the customer care number and promised on site support. I live in Kolkata. Customer care experience can vary from place to place.\n\nBased on actual user experience I can say that this TV has proved to be more than what I had expected.\n\nA pure value for money buy!",

You may require to connect a external home theatre to feel good sound effect.\n\n(I had bought a 49'' sony 4K television in 2017, which costs for 94K, where as I bought a 43'' 4K television for 20K in 2020.)\n\nOverall impression is very Worth to buy. . .",

Sound is one of the best I heard in comparison to other TV, I also have a Samsung TV which generally play sound at 60-70 volume but in this TV 15-20 is more than enough. Maybe due to 30W speakers (Samsung smart has 20W).

I didn't find any variations in my 1 week usage. It does produce DTS effect and usually witin lower volume range( below 25)your needs will be fullfilled and have great viewing experience. If you are looking for budget 4k TV go for it, this is far better than its China made competitors.\nI have not faced any issues with TV, If in case anything happens I'll be sure to update my review.

Whenever I switch on the TV to use the internet applications, it says \"cannot connect to internet.\" I have to forget my already added wifi connection and then connect again to restore the internet.\n\n2. I am being forced and constantly being called/messaged by SPPL to give rating in return of 3 months extended warranty. I hate being disturbed during working hours but they keep on doing this. The company has made a good product but they need to cut down on pesky marketing techniques.\n\n3. The quality of sound can be improved. Its not upto the level of a good TV.\n\nBarring these three reasons, there is no reason why anyone would give a bad review to this TV.\n\nUpdate: After using TV for 2 weeks now, I can also deduct a * because the Chromecast on this TV sucks. Many times it wont get connected. There is no fix to the problem so you have to live with it now.",
