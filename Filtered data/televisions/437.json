            "Ordered in BBD n hot this beauty for just 3000/month till 24months.\nDelivery was quicker than expected date and installation team from samsung came the next day itself and did their best job as always.\n\nThe initial experience in the TV is top notch.. Thanks to 120 Hz refresh rate picturesque is very smooth.\nNetflix prime video works very well could stream YouTube at 4K. From Jio Cinema to Hotstar all much needed apps are there. Still if you need android experience jus getting a android TV box will do the job and universal remote of samsung is compatible with tv boxes setup boxes and much more.\nIt's been jus 2 days now will update a neat usage review soon",
            "Best LED/QLED TV right now in the market, and for 75K it is a steal. I read here some people are complaining about the picture quality of the TV to them I say there might be something wrong(defect) with your TV, plz get it exchanged for a new piece, The picture quality on the frame is amazing with little setting changes as per your need. The TV has gorgeous Art Mode, also the game mode is good too. The TV itself looks gorgeous, the one box is also a good tool to minimize the wire clutter, The blacks are deep & the best in any LED tv's right now and very close to OLED tv's, this tv has amazing 10bit IPS screen with gives amazing pictures, the 2019 QLED have truly narrowed the gape between Super expensive OLED in terms of picture quality, it's very hard to tell the difference between the both now, therefore it dosent make any sense NOW to spend another 70k to 1Lac extra for OLED's when QLED's are near identical. Plus OLED comes with its own set of issues like it are not bright enough or colours are not vibrate enough as compared to LED/QLED, also not to forget the screen burn issue which is unique to OLED's, On the other hand QLED's have legendary brightness and are known for vivid colours, this helps a lot for any QLED owners in home conditions where you have windows and good amount of natural light coming inside which does not bother or effect your picture contrast and sharpness. The HDR 10+ is another amazing feature which makes the picture look more vibrant & colorful, most of the new online content on Netflix and Prime are now available in HDR. 120Hz motion flow feature does wonder for gaming and watching sports but some may not like it while watching Films or regular TV, you can simply go to the pictures settings and turn it off. Recently I watched \"the boys\" which is available in 4k HDR on Prime and it was a treat. The billion day sale price was a steal. I have been planning to buy a TV since June this year my budget was 2Lac and I was inclined towards OLED TV's but after a long research & seeing the price difference it just didn't nake any sense not to go for this tv. My final verdict is samsung has come up with a winner here. If you can score this TV for under 1Lac then go for it without thinking much.",
            "This TV is an absolute stunner and at 85k (during big billion sale) it was a golden opportunity to get this home. As the name suggests, it truly looks like a portrait on the wall. Great picture quality with wide viewing angles. The only thing missing I would say are Alexa and Google assistant which is available in other regions. Not sure when Samsung would be introducing support for Alexa and Google assistant. Overall, a great product with amazing picture quality.",
            "If you are looking for a sleek tv, then this is not it. If you are looking for TV with great resolution and stylish, then you should buy this tv. Overall amazing experience, connectivity with devices is very smooth and quick. The frame looks amazing when it's off. Apart from that the 120Hz refresh rate is very rare in TVs. Internal memory is little low but overall amazing. Netflix, Prime are pre-installed. Also the universal remote is amazing.",
            "Bought this for 77k using my emi card in great Indian sale. Decided this over OnePlus TV(not the pro , the normal one costing 69k) for the following reasons:\n1. Picture is lot better. Panel is better and refresh rate (120hz) is double than that of OnePlus\n2. Sound is better ( than normal Q1 and not q1pro)\n3. Samsung invented Qleds !!\n\nso far , usage has been lag free and quite good. for a medium sized room, you don't even need a home theatre system.",
            "Another great product purchased. Netflix button is there on the remote. TV delivered on 16oct19 and the installation was done next day. They're very friendly and described each and every function with extra effort (like how to use my mobile as remote, Live Camera streaming to TV, how to use the all time ON Photoframe when TV is Off , and much more). About the image quality, it's 55\" QLED 4K with 120 hertz refreshing rate with 100 percent color volume. 40 watt speakers. No need of additional speakers.",
            "Love the qled panel. Absolutely love the art mode. Very happy so far. If I have to knit pick, the no gap wall mount is not absolutely no gap, it has some gap. So I'm not sure if that depends on the skills of the guy installing or that much is acceptable gap.",
            "After lot of thoughts between Oneplus Q1 Pro & Samsung the frame, went ahead with this purchase. God I'm never gonna regret.\n\nHave visited Samsung Opera House (Bangalore) to check the TV before buying, but to my dismay it was not in display and not sold offline (As per inputs from store employee). Happened to see the display of Q60 & Q70.\n\nVisited the Oneplus Store and checked out the Q1 & Q1 Pro TV's.\n\nOn visual comparison between Samsung Q60 & Oneplus Q1 Pro, felt the display of Samsung...\nREAD MORE",
            "Absolutely Loved it.\nExcept sound everything is perfect in this TV.\nConnectivity, ease to use, remote compatibility with multiple devices like Firestick and tatasky, all top notch.",
            "This was the first time I had ordered such an expensive electronic item online. I was naturally very anxious for how it will go through. But this turned out to be the best purchase I have done in Flipkart. The Samsung The Frame TV 2019 is one of best and unique TVs in the market right now. And the price offered by Flipkart was a real steal deal. It has the best picture and sound quality at this price. I have no complaints as of now with the TV. The only issue i faced was the delayed delivery. I had ordered the product on 2nd October and the promised delivery date was 14th October. But I received the product on 24th October and there was no proper updates from Flipkart about the status. The Flipkart customer care people were not able to provide any real time updates or resolutions. The installation by the Samsung executives was real quick and professional. Overall I am very satisfied with this purchase through Flipkart. The only suggestion I have for Flipkart is to improve their logistics infrastructure specially during the special sales days. Many of the customers would not be as patient as me.",

They're very friendly and described each and every function with extra effort (like how to use my mobile as remote, Live Camera streaming to TV, how to use the all time ON Photoframe when TV is Off , and much more). About the image quality, it's 55\" QLED 4K with 120 hertz refreshing rate with 100 percent color volume. 40 watt speakers. No need of additional speakers.",
            "Love the qled panel. Absolutely love the art mode. Very happy so far. If I have to knit pick, the no gap wall mount is not absolutely no gap, it has some gap. So I'm not sure if that depends on the skills of the guy installing or that much is acceptable gap.",
            "After lot of thoughts between Oneplus Q1 Pro & Samsung the frame, went ahead with this purchase. God I'm never gonna regret.\n\nHave visited Samsung Opera House (Bangalore) to check the TV before buying, but to my dismay it was not in display and not sold offline (As per inputs from store employee). Happened to see the display of Q60 & Q70.\n\nVisited the Oneplus Store and checked out the Q1 & Q1 Pro TV's.\n\nOn visual comparison between Samsung Q60 & Oneplus Q1 Pro, felt the display of Samsung...\nREAD MORE",
            "Absolutely Loved it.\nExcept sound everything is perfect in this TV.\nConnectivity, ease to use, remote compatibility with multiple devices like Firestick and tatasky, all top notch.",
            "This was the first time I had ordered such an expensive electronic item online. I was naturally very anxious for how it will go through. But this turned out to be the best purchase I have done in Flipkart. The Samsung The Frame TV 2019 is one of best and unique TVs in the market right now. And the price offered by Flipkart was a real steal deal. It has the best picture and sound quality at this price. I have no complaints as of now with the TV. The only issue i faced was the delayed delivery. I had ordered the product on 2nd October and the promised delivery date was 14th October. But I received the product on 24th October and there was no proper updates from Flipkart about the status. The Flipkart customer care people were not able to provide any real time updates or resolutions. The installation by the Samsung executives was real quick and professional. Overall I am very satisfied with this purchase through Flipkart. The only suggestion I have for Flipkart is to improve their logistics infrastructure specially during the special sales days. Many of the customers would not be as patient as me.",
