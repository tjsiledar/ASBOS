            "TV is some what good ...infact it's an value for money especially go for 40 inches one that's better than this .... installation is also good .but from customer care persons does not show any value for us .it's too bad from Jeeves customer care ...respect the customer for theirs queries",
            "Hi Guys, this is an amazing item.\nPros:\nPicture: Excellent Picture quality for the price paid. It is written HD READY but believe me you can play 1080p seamlessly.\n\nAudio: volume at 20 is more than enough for a 15 x 10 feet room. I tried upto 50... still 50 %is left. That kind of bomb boom quality. Beats of music so nice at price point.\n\nConnectivity: Easy WIFI ACCESS no problem at all.\n\nApps: I didn't tried to install other apps yet... bcoz alot of usefull apps are pre-installed. Most of them are very useful for kids... where they are no ads in viewing and learning rhymes.\n\nBuild quality: Its plastic body... looks very good.\n\nCons:\nRemote is not smart... we can pay other 1000 if it is smart remote.\n\nConclusion: Best Made in INDIA product. This a proof we are in electronic Race. Just buy it and encourage.\n\nAt first I brought for a Aged Couple who need a budget TV. When I saw the quality I too booked one for me, one for my sister and now another neighbor is booking. Total of 4 pieces in one week. That kind of quality... served. Thank you hope you find it useful...",

            "I got my 32\" Coocaa TV delivery on time (30-Nov-2021) and then it's Free Installation and Demo was scheduled on very next day (01-Dec-2021) through \"Jeeves Consumer Services\".\n\nOn the day of installation, I got multiple messages regarding changes of technician assigned. The last technician ( MAHIBUB CHANDSAHEB LUKADE ) assigned for installation and demo didn't call at all although he was suppose to call me as per SMS. Instead I got the message at the end of day saying \"Technician tried calling you however he could not connect\". So I tried calling them multiple times on the given number in the SMS. Every time I tried calling them they just disconnected my call. Then I got another message that I will get automated call for rescheduling the installation in 24 hours, so I kept waiting for a call. I didn't get any call neither from Flipkart nor from Jeeves.\nThen today on 3rd-Dec-2021, I got automated call and I rescheduled the installation and demo to next free slot. After sometime I got new SMS saying Installation and Demo of Coocaa TV is cancelled.. Same status is updated on flipkart orders page.. What the hell is going on here Flipkart ? This is totally Unacceptable and not expected from you..\n\nI baught new 32\" Coocaa TV which is pending for it's installation and demo which is marked as cancelled now without my knowledge.. These people already have eaten up 3 days of Return Period of my purchased TV item and my new TV is just lying in the opened box (it's open box delivery by flipkart) at my home. I cannot even start it.. how will I check it if it is working fine or not before return period overs.\n\nThis is really frustrating, annoying and completely unprofessional service from Flipkart and Jeeves..\n\nJUST NOT ACCEPTABLE..",
