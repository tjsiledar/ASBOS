            "Writing this review, after almost a month of using it, previously I have used the realme sled tv too, so I have the idea of how TV's are in this price range, so to start with, this is a great TV, probably the best in this price bracket.\n\nPICTURE QUALITY on this is awesome, colors are on point, default presets/modes are all perfect, DOLBY VISION makes it even better, viewing angles are awesome on this TV as it has an ADS panel, no tv in this price range offers an ADS panel, the realme sled tv had a bright VA panel therefore it had very poor viewing angles, the panel on this TV could have been brighter, but at this budget it's too much to ask for, but gets the job done even in well lit environments.\n\nSOUND on this TV is great, its very clear, crisp and there is good amount of bass too, Dolby Atmos comes turned off out of the box, turn it on, you'll see a noticible difference in the sound output, can say its the best in this price segment.\n\nCONNECTIVITY is great, as it has dual band WiFi, although AUX port is not there, which would have been better.\n\nPERFORMANCE is one of the major upsides of this TV, comes with Android 10, Tv's very responsive, fast and wakes up with in 4 secs. Switching between apps is also very fast on the TV.\n\nOVERALL this is a perfect budget TV, if you're planning to buy one, go for this without second thoughts, you'll not be disappointed, I have only rated this 4 stars, just for the above average brightness and for missing AUX port, else I would have rated it 5 stars.\n\nHoping this review will help you.",
            "Hey everyone!\n\nPurchased this product last year Oct'2020.\n\nDON'T RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT to anyone\n\nInitial disappointment came when Google assistant stopped working only few days after I started using the TV.\nIt didn't get resolved even after updating the Android OS/ security patches.\n\n2 days before to this review, LED panel stopped showing picture.\nAudio output was coming but no video was seen on the panel.\n\nLucky that there are 3 more months before an year completes, I have seen this issue.\n\nAfter reporting it to the concerned team, Jeeves, is the partner for this services, right away told me, LED panel is busted, they are ordering for that part but highly probable that I would receive new TV instead.\n\nAnd I'm not happy about that as well!\nApparently they cannot guarantee that new TV also might not work as expected on long run.\n\nTotally disappointed with the experience of purchasing this TV.\n\nIf someone is still buying TV from Motorola, better take insurance/guarantee/warranty along with it.\n\nSuggestions to Motorola, if at all someone concerned is reading this review, upgrade the build quality which should never be compromised I suppose.\n\nThanks guys for this long read.\n\nCiao!",
            "Lot of hype, but read the fine print and understand what you are really buying.\n1. First of all this is NOT a Motorola designed or manufactured TV. It is merely Motorola branded, Flipkart designed, Skyworth manufactured TV.\n2. This means, this TV is designed and manufactured as per Flipkart standards. Not sure how it compares with Flipkart owned MarQ brand. Motorola has simply licensed its brand name. No other involvement from Motorola in product development.\n3. The build quality is good, but not excellent. One can press the panel around the bezels and see it getting pushed in the housing. Does not inspire full confidence. Hope this does not cause seepage of moisture thrrough the edges.\n4. The panel is of type ADS, supposed to be better than IPS. It does seem to hold similar viewing angles and contrast seems to be equivalent of a VA panel. No issues here.\n5. Color reproduction is good and so is contrast. The panel is bright.\n6. Sound is again adequate, but nowhere near the hype. While sound has good clarity, bass is underwhelming. An indpendant sound bar with woofer will deliver better fidelity and bass.\n7. No problems with any connectivity - HDMI, HDMI ARC, USB, wi-fi with 5GHz band all tested and working seamlessly. I used HDMI ARC to connect to an external Blaupunkt soundbar and it connects seamlesslt - note you do need an HDMI cable supporting ARC. Not all HDMI cables support ARC.\n8. Chromecast works without any issues.\n9. Since this is Android, there is a vast library of apps available on Google play store. All apps - Prime, Netflix, Disney Hotstar, SonyLiv, etc. Work fine. One can download other apps from Google play store\n10. What is surely missing is the home launcher like MI's Patchwall. The default Google Apps launcher is unimpressive and not very content friendly. I hope that the TV gets upgraded to Google TV launcher in the future. I tried side-loading the Patchwall and Google TV APKs, but they don't seem to work.\n\nThe biggest challenges are going to be around longevity of the product and service. The entire warranty and service process is managed by Jeeves, not Flipkart, not Motorola. Read the reviews of Jeeves service to learn more about the poor service. It would have been better if service were managed by Motorola to inspire confidence. Here MI beats this product hands-down, due to extensive brand-owned service centers.\nI am not sure of the long term usage reviews - will be happy if this TV lasts beyond 5 years without malfunctions.",
            "Value for money. As 4k content is not so widely available for now, don't waste too much money on branded TV's like sony, samsung,lg. Sound is too good and extra sound bar or speakers not needed. Picture quality is good enough. Even SD channels showing good results. Boots fasts. Overall a good package. (Note: 15 days review)",
            "Video- 10 (DolbyVision works fine)\nAudio- 10 (Soundbar is beautiful and loud)\nGraphics- 10\nNetwork and Conmectivity- 10\nPure Android- Wow!! Flawless! All Apps work!\nApps and Processing -10\nVoice Command- 10\nDelivery-10\nRemote- Motorola please cut it in Half and reduce the width and length and height. It looks like 90s design.\n\nI have been using it for last 9 days. It's a masterpiece! I had used Sony and Samsung in past. But this one is above all.\nFlipkart and Jeeves are doing their best to supply and wall mount on the given time.\n\nCheers to all! Go grab it! No second thought!!",

            "Writing this review, after almost a month of using it, previously I have used the realme sled tv too, so I have the idea of how TV's are in this price range, so to start with, this is a great TV, probably the best in this price bracket.\n\nPICTURE QUALITY on this is awesome, colors are on point, default presets/modes are all perfect, DOLBY VISION makes it even better, viewing angles are awesome on this TV as it has an ADS panel, no tv in this price range offers an ADS panel, the realme sled tv had a bright VA panel therefore it had very poor viewing angles, the panel on this TV could have been brighter, but at this budget it's too much to ask for, but gets the job done even in well lit environments.\n\nSOUND on this TV is great, its very clear, crisp and there is good amount of bass too, Dolby Atmos comes turned off out of the box, turn it on, you'll see a noticible difference in the sound output, can say its the best in this price segment.\n\nCONNECTIVITY is great, as it has dual band WiFi, although AUX port is not there, which would have been better.\n\nPERFORMANCE is one of the major upsides of this TV, comes with Android 10, Tv's very responsive, fast and wakes up with in 4 secs. Switching between apps is also very fast on the TV.\n\nOVERALL this is a perfect budget TV, if you're planning to buy one, go for this without second thoughts, you'll not be disappointed, I have only rated this 4 stars, just for the above average brightness and for missing AUX port, else I would have rated it 5 stars.\n\nHoping this review will help you.",
            "Hey everyone!\n\nPurchased this product last year Oct'2020.\n\nDON'T RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT to anyone\n\nInitial disappointment came when Google assistant stopped working only few days after I started using the TV.\nIt didn't get resolved even after updating the Android OS/ security patches.\n\n2 days before to this review, LED panel stopped showing picture.\nAudio output was coming but no video was seen on the panel.\n\nLucky that there are 3 more months before an year completes, I have seen this issue.\n\nAfter reporting it to the concerned team, Jeeves, is the partner for this services, right away told me, LED panel is busted, they are ordering for that part but highly probable that I would receive new TV instead.\n\nAnd I'm not happy about that as well!\nApparently they cannot guarantee that new TV also might not work as expected on long run.\n\nTotally disappointed with the experience of purchasing this TV.\n\nIf someone is still buying TV from Motorola, better take insurance/guarantee/warranty along with it.\n\nSuggestions to Motorola, if at all someone concerned is reading this review, upgrade the build quality which should never be compromised I suppose.\n\nThanks guys for this long read.\n\nCiao!",
            "Lot of hype, but read the fine print and understand what you are really buying.\n1. First of all this is NOT a Motorola designed or manufactured TV. It is merely Motorola branded, Flipkart designed, Skyworth manufactured TV.\n2. This means, this TV is designed and manufactured as per Flipkart standards. Not sure how it compares with Flipkart owned MarQ brand. Motorola has simply licensed its brand name. No other involvement from Motorola in product development.\n3. The build quality is good, but not excellent. One can press the panel around the bezels and see it getting pushed in the housing. Does not inspire full confidence. Hope this does not cause seepage of moisture thrrough the edges.\n4. The panel is of type ADS, supposed to be better than IPS. It does seem to hold similar viewing angles and contrast seems to be equivalent of a VA panel. No issues here.\n5. Color reproduction is good and so is contrast. The panel is bright.\n6. Sound is again adequate, but nowhere near the hype. While sound has good clarity, bass is underwhelming. An indpendant sound bar with woofer will deliver better fidelity and bass.\n7. No problems with any connectivity - HDMI, HDMI ARC, USB, wi-fi with 5GHz band all tested and working seamlessly. I used HDMI ARC to connect to an external Blaupunkt soundbar and it connects seamlesslt - note you do need an HDMI cable supporting ARC. Not all HDMI cables support ARC.\n8. Chromecast works without any issues.\n9. Since this is Android, there is a vast library of apps available on Google play store. All apps - Prime, Netflix, Disney Hotstar, SonyLiv, etc. Work fine. One can download other apps from Google play store\n10. What is surely missing is the home launcher like MI's Patchwall. The default Google Apps launcher is unimpressive and not very content friendly. I hope that the TV gets upgraded to Google TV launcher in the future. I tried side-loading the Patchwall and Google TV APKs, but they don't seem to work.\n\nThe biggest challenges are going to be around longevity of the product and service. The entire warranty and service process is managed by Jeeves, not Flipkart, not Motorola. Read the reviews of Jeeves service to learn more about the poor service. It would have been better if service were managed by Motorola to inspire confidence. Here MI beats this product hands-down, due to extensive brand-owned service centers.\nI am not sure of the long term usage reviews - will be happy if this TV lasts beyond 5 years without malfunctions.",
            "Value for money. As 4k content is not so widely available for now, don't waste too much money on branded TV's like sony, samsung,lg. Sound is too good and extra sound bar or speakers not needed. Picture quality is good enough. Even SD channels showing good results. Boots fasts. Overall a good package. (Note: 15 days review)",

            "Stylish looking TV with excellent picture quality with support of hdr10, dolby vision. Sound quality is also pretty good with dolby atmos turned on. The UI is also quite smooth & responsive most of the time.\nIn Netflix app though there is dolby vision logo available, but I couldn't find the dolby atmos logo there, only 5.1 surround sound is available (with pass-through audio settings). May be this tv is not registered in Netflix's dolby atmos supported device list.\n\nReason for 1 less star: I'm very skeptical about the manufacturing quality control. I got a defective product 1st time with bleeding issue. The panel was not sealed to the body at all, all the lights underneath were visible from the corner of the screen.

            "Wovvv!!!!!! One of the best TVs in the market.\n\nPicture:\n\nI have had the doubt that this TV has brightness of 350 nitts which is not sufficient for Dolby Vision. But Motorola has done their best job in this area and the picture quality is awesome in this product. 4K videos are delivered in a very smooth manner.\n\n\nSound:\n\nThis product has 50 watts speakers. The audio output of the TV is excellent. You can really experience Dolby Atmos and DTS surround. It gives a small theatre effect in this price range. You never experience this kind of audio in any other 4K 55\" TVs.\n\nConnectivity:\n\nSince it's supporting dual band WiFi , 4K videos are delivered in a very decent manner. Videos were never buffered.\n\nOperating System:\n\nAndroid 10 is giving fast boost, RAM optimization and new apps options.\n\nOther features:\n\nAuto dimming, HDR10, WOW and WOS in WiFi settings.\n\nNote:\n\nThis product is missing MEMC. But I saw it did not affect anywhere in the picture quality and delivery of video.\n\nSo, finally I would say you can go for this product without having any second thoughts. I'm 100% sure that you'll get more satisfied than your expectations about this.\n\nAll the very best!!!!!!!!! :)",

This LED has a premium design with good built quality and very thin bezels.\n2. The screen quality is also good with Dolby Picture Features.\n3. It is based on latest android 10 version and has 2GB RAM and 32GB storage.\n4. The remote also has very good built quality and the google assistant works well.\nCons: 1.

You can try other ways of connecting your mobile like Google Home.\n3. I have heard people complaining about screen bleeding issue.\n\nConclusion: You will never find all feature in a single product, therefore this LED provides a good value for money.

            "I've been using this TV for about 10 days, and I am happy to own this product. Delivery and installation were great.\n\nDisplay is awesome (was worried with the 350 nits and 3000:1 contrast ratio specifications, but definitely not something to fret over). Looks are fabulous. No problems with the connectivity so far.\n\nExcept, I'm disappointed with the crispiness of the sound. The music and background score are being played nicely, but not the vocals and speech. Not sure if I can fix this with a setting - but I can't properly hear what people are speaking in the frame as these voices and dialogues are not crisp enough to pierce through the background score and music. I need to really focus to understand the speech, yet will still miss a lot of things. If I increase the volume to overcome that problem - the music and background score increases even more and doesn't let the speech penetrate through their now increased volume - defeating the purpose altogether. Bottom line, I can't hear the vocals / speech properly. Either they are too low on volume, or the volume of everything else is blown out of proportions.\n\nSo a lesson learnt is that the loudness (50 watts) isn't really a measure of a good sound. Music sounds great, but not the speech. Not sure if this can be fixed at all. And if that is so, a good part of the user experience goes out the window.",
            "*Review after 4 months of use*\n\nTalking about the build quality it is pretty durable survived the drop test \ud83d\ude02 (jk). Made up of good plastic and gives a premium look with pretty small Bezels.\n\nCurrently running on Android 10 and is pretty smooth but what bothers me is whenever the tv is switched on it is a bit laggy and has sound delay but after few seconds it the lag goes away. ( Seems like a software issue which can be easily fixed )\n\nTalking about the display and sound, it gets 10 on 10. Even though you won't get true Dolby Atmos feel for obvious reasons but still does a great job. The colours absolutely stunning and popping watching 4k content or Dolby vision content would never let you regret buying this one. But..! If you sit in the corner of the tv you can notice bright light wich goes away if you change your sitting position. This bothers me too, but yeah this can't be called light bleeding.\n\nIn a nut shell I award it 9/10.\nPretty decent product at really aggressive price, go for it.",
            "I am writing this review after almost 15 days of installation.\nOrdered and received the package in 3 days the installation process also took 2 days. The time when I recieved the TV I thought it will support all the application that we run on our phone but Android TV has it's own ecosystem. It Play Store does not have the same applications that our Play Store has. There is no file manager or Google Files and it's not available on play store also you cannot access the internal files of the TV. It has 32GB of storage and 2GB of ram, usable storage is 27GB. But I think this storage is just for show you cannot access the internal files of the TV then why do we have this storage. TV boots pretty fast. Interface is easy and it has no clutter. If you have dual band wifi the connectivity will be awesome. Picture quality is great. Brightness is also good. Colours are little dull but I think you can adjust it in the settings (I don't know how to do it). You need HD TV connection otherwise you will make the TV less charming. I haven't did any heavy task on TV but I think it will work fine. The sound quality is great. Dolby Atmos makes it awesome to listen music. I has surround sound. I keep volume on 25 usually. And it's well and audible at it. Overall it's a great TV and value for money if you are considering Android TV. Got this for 28,700 rupees on Big billion days and by using credit card got additional 12350 rupees discount. It's great deal in this price range. Picture quality is awesome, sound quality is good. And the main thing it boots very fast.",

I'm also amazed at the picture quality and colour reproduction. I'm really satisfied that I'm getting the experience that big names LG, Samsung offer for higher prices.

Its really really nice...\nIf you play 4k content then you clearly see whats the capability of display...\nI watched some 4k Dolby vision content on Netflix and the picture quality is stunning.. But it almost took 3-4 gb per hour to show that high quality content hahahah.\nEnabling Dolby Atmos for that 50 watt speaker really really makes much difference.\nComing to processor,ram and storage as everyone knows its top notch... Really very fast you can just feel power of android 10 and the processor.. never lagged\nMy one more advice is use this tv with a stabilizer which is almost 3k but never skip it really protects tv.\nTv looks are really premium and the build quality is also top notch...\n\nOnly con:\nIt doesn't have Data saver option currently but i can see its pre Installed but doesn't show in settings.. im hoping that its just a software bug and will solve it in next update...\n\nClearing you confusion:\nMany of you have one big confusion to choose Nokia tv or Motorola renou tv..\nYou must be doubt about its brightness levels like it has 350 nits but nokia has 400 nits.. just tell you one thing brightness is really good never doubt about it.. even default settings are at just 50% you can increase if u feel little less.

The Dolby vision and hdr 10 and Dolby Atmos all make this simply leagues ahead of any TV below 70000. The sound bar with Atmos is sufficient for a normal room. 4k videos are great to watch on this bezel less TV. Just buy it if you want something that will make you happy. Only thing is after sales service and longevity but will post if anything happens .",
            "This is my second motorola tv as i have a 55 inch motorola tv too. The first TV is so good that i chose motorola the second time too. The only confusion was between motorola ZX pro and Revou range. As i had the same looking tv like the ZX pro i chose Revou as it looks much better looking with thin bezels and streamlined shape. So lets start with my observations :\nPros:\n1. The display is awesome. The colors really pop out so well and the images look so real.\n2. The setup process is such a breeze. You get a notification on your mobile as soon as the setup begins and in just two three steps the setup gets going. Google has made the setup so easy that it feels like plug and play.\n3. Continuing from the 2nd point, is Android 11 software on this TV. The main gripe that a lot of people had in other older motorola tv was that the tv took a lot of time to start each time one switched on the tv. That was because of android 10 software. Now with android 11 in Revou, the tv just wakes from sleep instantaneously (if you close the tv from remote and do not switch the mains off) and even when one switches on the TV from the mains switch, it still takes so less time now. I sincerely wish motorola would upgrade my older Motorola tv with Android 11 too.\n4. There are two wifi bands on this TV (my older one has just 1),which helps me as i can choose the one which gives me better speeds. It helps if one is watching 4k content.\n5. Everything to setup this tv comes in the box. The wall bracket also comes in the box which is such a huge relief as most tv technicians charge extra for the wall bracket. So a saving of Rs. 700 atleast. Just that the bracket looks flimsy but as the tv is thin and light, it can easily take the load.\nCons:\n1. The TV has a 24watt speakers on the 43 inch model which sounds less compared to 50 watt speaker on my 55 inch other tv, which are booming speakers as compared to it. In fact the sound is hearable from 20 percent onwards on the speaker scale on this tv. And if one is watching a movie with fan on in the room, then the speaker has to be cranked to 50 percent. In the 55 inch tv, I cound never dare to go higher than 20 to 25 percent unless I want to invite the neighbors to complain for noise pollution. All said, the sound is clear on this and quality is pretty good.\n2. The remote is too big for my taste. It is the same remote on all motorola tvs. Now as remote are going smaller with all tvs, motorola should consider small and sleeker remote. There are buttons on this tv that i have never used in the last two years on my older tv and will probably never use on this tv too. The number pad on this remote is just too much as it feels like the old times we had remote to change tv channels. The only plus point is that the range is very good and the tactile feel for pressing buttons is very good.\n\nOverall its a wonderful tv to purchase and will recommend it to everyone looking to purchase a good 4k tv in this price range.",
            "Brilliant Built by Motorola. Excellent Picture and Sound . Superbly designed. I'm reviewing this after a long satisfaction of 6 months usage.. only android tv so far with latest Android 10 and stock android.
