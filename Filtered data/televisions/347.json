Coming to display it is really very good but standard resolution tend to pixelate naturally.. Some video n sound enhancements need to be done by users only. Had an amazing experience watching movies and youtube videos even without home theatre system.. This 40 inch TV covers almost 1/3 of the wall so it gives a cinematic experience. Hope u now like the product.. Some of the enhancements to be done manually are described below:\n1) bass n treble at 70\n2) picture should hv 30 backlight\n3) sharpness, contrast n brightness should be around 40 n color temperature is standard.\n4) Let the Eco Mode remain at middle..\n5) enable surround sound for clear separated flow of vocals n instruments..\n\nNow the device is ready for giving a enjoyable, strainless experience..

I tried to buy MI tv 43\" but I could not. For those who are sceptical about which one to buy, I will advice you to go with thomson as it is a well established brand. I am not promoting nor discouraging MI but want to say THOMSON is no less than MI. If you are unable to buy MI then try this in the flash sale.

You will get tired after typing some 10 characters in that virtual keypad.\n* No playstore. Hotstar is not working.\n* Whenever we get some ugly scenes in a movie we can forward it easily in a laptop or mobile . But here while trying to forward it in youtube , I bet the scene will be completed. User interface can be improved\n\nMI TV and this one size is almost same and price also . The extra 3000 is for extra 3 inches but for a middle class room this tv is more than enough. You need more space to view 40 inhes tv otherwise your eyes will get strained easily.\nOn a whole go for it. We do not have a 40 inch tv other than this in our market. The engineer , who came to my house also personally feels that thomson is a bit better than MI . Just take my review as a reference and go for mi/thomson which suits your needs..Just keep in mind that every tv has its own flaws. Just buy the one which has less and suits you more... Thank you.",

            "How Thomson TV cheats its customer\u2026\n\nLast month I brought Thomson Led Smart TV B9 102cm (40) (Order ID - OD212304472571607000) from Flipkart. Though Thomson TV claims its smart TV but its port and output sources are not new technology. The TV does not support or does not have basic option like Optical Digital Audio, HDMI (ARC) and even Optical cable option. So we can\u2019t connect our sound bar the Thomson TV\u2026.I wonder hoq it is \u2018SMART TV\u2019.\nThe customer care service is very pathetic nobody there to pick the customers\u2019 calls... even after many complaints nobody came and solve the problem\u2026 such worst experience\u2026",

            "I would say it's a beast in this price range. I am surprised why after 15 days since it's inception there is not so much channels in you tube. But one will find innumerable channels of MI Tv. So My earnest request do not follow these people blindly. They work like agents of some company. Now let's hv in depth review of Thompson TV. This is same company which was there in India in 80's at Par with the Onida, BPL, Akai, Funai. So it i has some brand under its belt. Mi is of recent origin so far as television is concerned. They are applying some tactics here in view of there popularity in mobile & launch smart tv. Thompson TV picture clarity is better than MI Tv as its color reproduction is good. 20 watt sound is more than enough for the price one paid. For good woofer experience I would suggest F&D home theater 5.2.Mirror cast work flawlessly in honor, MI, Le TV phones. I hv used it personally. So much Internet options and easy to use. Remote looks OK. People complain about its cheap quality. I would say even my favorite shinobi pro of Panasonic smart tv has plastic remote control. But can Sony Samsung and LG compete with its sound and picture clarity. You tube, Netflix are in inbuilt in Thompson TV. But in MI Tv u will only get buffering. For this price I would say hats off to Thompson and Flipkart for quick installation and also last but not the least Jeeves.",

They accepted the request and refunded the money. Flipkart executive were fully supportive and Thanks to them for their prompt response.\n\nI would also like to add one more thing. When I bought this TV, Thomson executive called me to give 5 star rating to this product. And in return, they offered me to extend the TV warranty by 3 months. I refused their offer as I don't want to misguide the actual buyers by my fake review and rating to this product.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Picture quality is not good.\n2. Sound quality is not good.\n3.

The installation was ok although all he did was just connect the cables and mounted it on the wall a bit crooked, but can't really blame him for not understanding the water level thing. Coming to the tv, it shows pink/purple ish colours sometimes when we start the tv. It goes back to normal when its restarted or if the input is changed. Thus has happened multiple times. The display is good i think. But the brightness and colour seems somewhat too much even at different settings. I think this is because of the hdr setting. The sound is in my opinion is what we get from a tv. But for a better experience, you might wanna get a soundbar or a home theater. The smart features work nicely so far. It hang once i tried to connect using miracast and had to unplug to get it right as no remote button or the physical button worked and the tv just froze. Usb connection works well and the other applications too. I guess for the price to get all these features, the tv is fine.",

            "Product was pathetic. within 3 months, Motherboard is not working and no support from customer care executives. Not having authorized service center as well. They have tie-up with TV service which was not so supportive. They did not get parts from Thomson and they don't have any clue at all about problem as well as the service parts.\n\nI don't recommend to buy Thomson TV just because of price. We can pay more to Samsung, Sony, LG rather buying cheaper Thomson TV or some other company. Quality is compromised for their cost and service.",

Reduce the following parameters to get awesome picture quality\nBrightness - 50\ncontrast - 35\ncolour - 40\nSharpness - 30\nBacklight = 20%\n2. If ur an music enthusiastic then buy separate music system.\n3. For updating Google play store, open the Google play store from computer and give update by selecting these tv model.( U can refer YouTube)\n4. Buy one wireless mouse u will definitely need it\n5. Don't worry just go for it.",
            "Bought it for my friend, though bit disappointed with the delay in installation and demo. Thompson's 2nd innings in India will be long lasoif they continue to provide good quality products like this. Audio doesn't seem like 20W otherwise looks really good and worth for the money. Would love to have a Bluetooth connection.",

            "One star for Thomson's team calling up and asking to give 5 Stars on Facebook and in exchange providing additional year of warranty. How about providing genuine good customer service or give the customers additional complimentary warranty first which makes you deserve the 5 Stars rather than trying to buy the ratings?",

The TV lacks two thingss i.e. Screencast and Hotstar app. I guess both these features were included in the next variant which is also offered at same price. I believe Flipkart /Jeeves must offer free software upgrade since the product is under warranty",

            "My honest review after using this Smart TV for 1 month!\nPros:\n1. Great Picture quality & viewing angles with different picture modes\n2. Sound is loud enough\n3. No lags while surfing the internet, file manager or watching videos on YouTube.\n4. Value for money go for it!\n\nCons:\n1. You might face connectivity issues 10 out of 2 times while using screen cast or mirror display.\n2. If your video resolution is 1920 x 1080 i.e. 1080p of height, then it will not work. Less than 1080p of height is ok.\n*Fix: Install any third party app like MX player or VLC player*\n3. Mouse mode or typing while keyboard pop-up is not handy, you need to be familiar with it or connect external mouse or keyboard!\n\n*Tip: Though it has 8 GB of internal memory, only 5 GB is free of it so do not install too many third party apps, or you might find some lags in performance.*",

I therefore update the earlier rating to 3. TV also missing its Right side leg to support on desktop. the product supplier has not properly inspected its packing that is why they sent me both legs LL instead of LR.

            "3 Stars only because the delivery, coordination with customer service, installation, uninstallation, return & refund was very smooth and professional. Appreciation to Flipkart, Jeeves and ekart for their service. Now about the Thomson TV : TV is made of poor quality. The first TV that was installed, the TV display color would turn purplish 3 of 5 times we turn it on. The quick fix was to turn it off and turn it on. Colour Red was very bright and watching some channel/movies that had a lot of use of red made watching uncomfortable after 15-20 mins of continuous watching. I found articles on the net which described this issue generally to the panel. So i requested for exchange. Pick-up, Delivery was all seamless and promptly carried out but the second time the TV came, it had the very same problem. So it returned it and asked for refund. The TV is manufactured by 'Super Plastronics' a delhi based company which also makes other brands like Kodak. They have license to use the 'Thomson' brand name but it appears there's zero quality check by Thomson. About the product quality : there's a big gap between the bezel and panel, so big that 10 sheets of paper thickness can easily slip in, which indicates that the panel and bezel (bezel holds the brand name) are manufactured independently and not aligned correctly. 40\u201c looks like a 34 inch TV in reality and if you are using AV port from cable setup box, there's lot of blurryness and lag when scene change quickly, which means its slow to refresh colours. Hotstar never worked, even after app was upgraded. It uses an old version of android, so Amazon prime also does not work. Wall mounting accessory looks like a normal photo hanging metal piece and it uses hard sponge at the rear base to keep the TV from directly touching the wall. On the positive side, it has 2 AV ports, reads USB storage upto 2 Tb.",
            "Value for money. Nice product, picture quality is great and WiFi is fast working, it's only for YouTube and search. Installation is toooo late and not satisfy.",
            "It has been taken 4 days to be delivered to the Nellore district ,\ninstallation and demo by Mr.Audi was quite good. Don't expect too much from the picture quality and the wall mount not at all satisfied. Miracast and youtube are working fine, But at this price you will get a best deal from the Thomson.Go ahead and enjoy the rest of the things.",
            "good product with this budget!!! app work good but mostly 98% apps requires update google play store but we could not update that( Android kitkat only) so most app does not work properly. blue ray video in you tube look like great !!!\n\nwarning!!!- who use tata sky hd Dolby sound set top box note it, hd channel work without sound beacuse this tv does not have dolby sound, so use external speaker connect with tata hd set top box for tv channel and another 3 pin tv speaker connect with tv for youtube channel and usb songs-videos. no other option we use 2 separate speakers for good audio.\n\nthank you",

Not only mirror share but any applications which play video give very low sound. Another issue for which I logged complaint is date and time sets only when it is connected to wifi which means if you don't have wifi your TV will not show correct time. Epic thing is that feature also stopped working which means even in wifi date and time not getting updated. And if time and date is not updated even with wifi you can not use any applications so you have to set date and time manually every time you turn on TV to see any application. Their engineer visited and will visit again. No solution as of now. Service provided for TV repair is pathetic do not buy extended warranty",
