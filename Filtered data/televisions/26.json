Flipkart delivery is awesome and demo & installation is to good by jeeves. mi tv best tv in this price segment. picture and sound quality is too good. connectivity is also good. if u think buy new tv then u can definitely go with MI tv. its simply awesome.",

Buy iffalcon tv by TCL which is the best in all feature and cheaper then Mi TV.",
            "I ordered on friday, and got the product delivered on sunday plus the installation was also done in the evening. Very great ful experience. Picture quality is superb. I mean u wont feel a difference if u run a normal video, go for UHD or 4k videos or atleast Full HD videos. Sound was loud, good. And I didnt faced any connectivity issues yet, I connected the TV with wifi and the Netflix and youtube was smooth. Patch wall 2.0 is quite nice feature. I recommend this TV. Thanks flipkart!",

            "Fully satisfied with the product... picture quality is awesome, connectivity is quick and nice, sound is good enough for a living room. Excellent 5* product within that price bracket for the kind of features it has.\n\nA bit disappointed with the delivery timeline as it took 2-3 days more than what i have expected but the installation was quick.",
            "One of the best decisions I've made. As a LG user I was not sure if the Mi 4x would live up to it's promises but I am glad to say it's a beast. The picture quality is crisp and 4k videos play flawlessly. Android interface provides an ease of use. The new look of patchwall is refreshing and is loaded with tons of content. Both Netflix & Prime Videos work flawlessly on this smart tv. I've read a few negative comments about connectivity but as far as I've used the feature - it works well. The Bluetooth remote is very responsive and so is the Google voice assistant. The only let down(though not a deal breaker) is the sound quality. I believe the speakers are placed in such a way(at the bottom) that it would work well on a tabletop but not on wall mount. Having said that, the sound quality is not bad. At this price range you couldn't have asked for more. I am really loving it.",

You will be fed up of rebooting your TV every 15 mins.\n2) Cast DOES NOT work. I am using a MI mobile itself. Casting hangs the TV every 5 mins.\n3) Buy any other TV and do yourself a favor. Just because this has Netflix and Prime inbuilt, DO NOT buy it. You can anytime buy a Firestick but do not make a hole in your pocket buying this TV.\n\nWhat kinda smart TV is this with no Wifi grasping power, rebooting itself every 15 mins, Casting mobile to TV hangs the TV FOREVER.\n\nLong story short, DO NOT BUY THIS TV.\n\nMI has not provided any kind of fix or update yet.

            "i never thought you can get a 65inch tv so good for this price. i have a samsung 75inch which is for 4 times the price of this and you would not be able to make out the difference after some time. not much. althought we did recieve the tv one day late but forgiven. if you have a budget for Rs 60000 the go for this tv. personally gurantee, you will love it.",
            "The TV in overall package is really great however the modem that is inbuilt for WIFI connection to be established is not upto the expectation which results in the content being buffered on the TV despite other devices work well with the WIFI connection and show great speeds on them as well. The only thing that i am not happy about is Flipkart itself for the delivery being so slow and unpredictable. TV is great for now until i plan for a big one..lol..",

If the wifi router has 150mbps of speed then you cannot play a 4k video in this tv. A speed of atleast 300 - 600mbps of router will give you an amazing experience.\n(The speed iam talking about is not internet speed, the router speed - router capacity of transferring data)\n.\n.\nOver all this TV is fabulous at this price range.\nEnjoy! Cheers!",
            "Bought this smart TV on the first week of March and now I'm reviewing this in August. 4K panel is awesome and works flawless when I'm connecting it to my PC...but that's it. WiFi is a pain to connect. When I watch YouTube and Netflix and some videos on the apps, it keeps on buffering and will let me log out of the app which is really weird because I have a 70Mps plan and it works flawless on my other devices. I thought an update will fix this issue but it never has. Really disappointed with the TV. I'm just holding to it because I can connect it to my PC.",
            "Product is good overall in this budget. I do not see any color bleed and it seems LG panel is making quite an impact on this model. It's real eye candy to watch 4k and full hd is so good to watch on such a huge screen! Sound is enough for drawing room; in fact just enough for normal news and serial watching. If you want to make it a home theater, then Boat Avante 2000 160w is a killer deal and I'm surprised to see that an under 10k sound bar can give such a run for money to costly siblings. However, following features must be addressed by MI in their next OT update for this TV:\n\n1- No quick way to change the sound output. Every time you have to quit watching to access settings, change the output and come back launch the program again\n2- Pixel UI sometimes crashes. More testing is needed. I found a way to correct it whenever it conks. Just change the theme from light to dark and vizaviz\n3- Data Saver option always resets back to ON after restarting the TV. It's annoying when I have a dedicated broadband line and don't need this feature at all.\n\nI have given extra star only because of the Flipkart delivery system. They are best at handling fragile items. Same day installation was another surprise and the folks were super professional. This shows that brands are now taking Indian market seriously and know that good customer service will go long way.",

Google assistant built in the remote is very useful and works perfectly fine. Thanks to flipkart for super quick delivery and installation of the TV. Very happy with this purchase.",
            "Everything is Best.\nThe Delivery, and the installation was done on the day of delivery with in hours which was the best thing happened.\nThe Installation guy was very good with the knowledge about the television.\nThe only con I've observed was the Casting.\nCasting is not good. Hope it can be solved with proper system update.\nAnd also Casting is working only when phone and tv connected to same WiFi which is not happened in other popular brands.\nCasting connectivity totally cuts that 1 star rating.\nOverall the picture quality,sound and performance is the best in this price point. I do recommend this TV to who ever wants to buy it.",

            "Using the product for couple of weeks. So far satisfied. It is very good value for the money however there are technical glitches and you would find tough if you are not so tech savvy... Some points worth to note, there is No background data saver option as advertised ; tv remote stopped working (power button) after (probably) a automatic software update. I had to factory reset to recover my remote power button. Patch wall is just a launcher (like what you see in your smartphone) all the pre installed app needs paid subscription (except you tube) so amount of free content is only in the advertisement.. This tv doesn't come with wall mount accessories.. Flip cart service took 500 to get the wall mount.. Tv panel is not fps like high end tvs... And don't expect the quality as Sony /Samsung /LG. However if you are not so sure and don't want to invest much on TV, then this is the option you may go for.. <25k for an uhd 43 inch is no brainer.. You simply can't beat this price and go wrong..",

            "I had high expectations about the product due to high media hype about it by MI as well as by users. However, the picture quality while using cable channels is greatly disappointing and about, the so called dolby dts sound, the output is very very less and effect is horrible. The quality of sound does not match with the big screen TV. instead of woofer, MI has provided only poor quality of 20 W speakers which are suitable for voice only. Music or film can not be enjoyed with inbuilt speakers while we had enjoyed the great 10 w speakers provided by Sony in 32 inch tv. While playing videos, especially 4K videos, its spectacular and mind blowing. I use extra sound system through, then it is awesome. However, when I think of the amount I paid for the product, I forget all the defects and short comings and simply enjoy the show. No other company can give this product with this much low price. At my home, We four people use MI phones as well. With this product, we have become great fan of MI. thank you MI. With warm regards. Sudhakaran Wadakancheri",

            "The buy back order in Kochi office is a cheating. I had a 32 inch Panasonic TV in working condition. But the team from Kochi office do not accepted it. The buy back items handled and controlled in Kochi office by some merchants of a particular sect. They will accept it only if the buy back item is as good as brand new. The senior officials of Flipkart should look in to this underhand dealing between Flipkart Kochi office staff and scrap dealers. Flipkart shall protect the interests of customers as well as the scrap dealers. I sold the above tv for a price Rs. 200 above the buy back price.",
            "The MI TV (65\") is really a beast! No other words can be used to describe the experience.. Thanx Xiaomi... Talking about the TV, the picture is superb - full 5 Stars; however the sound is satisfactory, not great but pretty okay.. Other features are also nice, including connecting with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth devices... In short, the Xiaomi MI 4X TV is well worth the price at Rs.55k. However, the installation by JEEVES was not up to the mark.. The technician was not a professional and took a long time in setting up the TV.. further he came without an assistant, due to which I was forced to help him by holding the TV upright for almost 20 mts.. Not a nice experience at all.. However, I must reiterate the fact that the Xiaomi MI tv 65 inches in itself is a piece of art! Thanx XIAOMI once again",

I'm happy once the lan was connected directly.i have not been using patchwall at all,im happy with Android. Most important point of this tv is the dual band wifi connection given.. not all tvs at this price have dual band wifi.please read about dual band wifi to know why it is relevant in 2020..takes time to start (less than a min)but its ok ,,no big deal..really its a tv for middle class to enjoy as your first foray in smart tv and that too in 4k..i recommend buy a usb drive and download any software on it instead of TV's internal storage..did not face any issue with mirroring or casting",
            "Picture quality is good but not great the black levels are bad...because its an LG ips panel...if you watch a movie from side ways you can hardly see anything..specially night scenes its totally white...and strange there is no colour setting. plus the refresh rate is only 60hz which makes fast moving shots look really bad...sound is ok.....Tv looks very elegant.... overall TV is good if you dont care of black levels..Netflix and prime plays good on it.",
            "1. Speaker quality is poor. Not much clarity in audio output\n2. TV table stand holders are mere cheap plastic. Not durable\n3. Wireless connectivity like screen mirror doesn't work smooth. Disconnects sometime. But not a big problem.\n4. At start up it takes about nearly 60 seconds for switching on display.\n5. Picture quality is good",
            "Picture quality and viewing angle excellent\nSound is nice but it is better to have a speaker system for the the big screen\nUser friendly os\nFast installation\nNB : Don't compare this 4k tv with other brand such as Sony or LG .

You cannot hear anything clear in normal movies and only during any songs or action scenes suddenly sound picks up. No options to select any other sound mode or no equalizer make things very difficult. Have to keep volume levels really high to listen anything clearly. I should have trusted Sanyo over MI. Japanese rules in sound. Any suggestions to rectify this issue???",

            "Overall I am happy with my new MI 4x 43 inches TV, and I am writing my experience here:\n\n1. 4K and HD quality works excellent with this TV.\n2. In most of other user reviews I seen they mentioned about TV Audio quality is not up to mark. however i analysed this point very closely and found, Sound is Good and audible clearly, but sound quality going UP/Down on the basis of applications from where you run the your audio/video song.\n3. There are no in-built voltage stabilize, you should have to buy it, if light fluctuation in your area.\n4. During installation, my Jeeves\u2019s representative told me, if we don't install voltage stabilizer at the time of installation, we don't cover warrant of TV if something happened due to voltage fluctuation. I didn't get reply over this from Flip cart till now, will update you guys, and once get any update on this.\n5. Quality of stand is not up to mark, seems very low quality.\n6. For wall mount you don't need to pay any extra penny to Jeeves person, as it\u2019s already free. Only you have to pay INR 500, if you purchased wall mount from that person.\n7. There are no option to mute audio, which I think MI missed. There should be mute option at report.\n8. Build quality is low, if you touch corner of TV, you found some gap.\n9. SD channels is display is not good, you could found better experience with at least 780 Resolution video.\n10. Screen mirroring option is available with this TV and working fine.\n11. Up time is little bit high as compared to other branded TVs like Samsung and Sony\n12. No Lag to play video, if you have good internet speed. you should have at least 20 mbps speed to watch 4k videos\n13. It hang, you give multiple command through Google Assistance. else, Google assistance work flawless.\n14. Approx. 4.4 GB space available to use initially.\n15. They mentioned it have HDR 10, I don't think it have, however picture quality is good.\n16. In dark screen, picture quality get little bit down, I don't think it have more than 200 - 250 nits brightness",

Review of Jeeves installation team : This is the worst part of buying this TV. TV will be delivered on time but nobody turns up for installation. Then you escalate the issue with flipkart, they reply saying issue is escalated and will resolved by new deadline. Again nobody turns up and you frustratingly contact flipkart customer support for the same, they reply the same automated response and give you a new deadline and again nobody turns up.

After delivery installation and demo done by Jeeves on next day in a very good manner. I want to wall mount the TV, so service engineer brings a good quality of metallic wall mount stand with him and I pay him 500 rs. After installation, I got an update of 875 MB & got new Miracast app for direct casting which is too good. If you want Miracast app for direct casting then you should go for the update. Wireless Connectivity is very good,there are no any problems faced. Picture quality 4/5, Sound quality 4/5, Connectivity 5/5. All the functions and features ie. Google Chromecast are working properly. I am not faced any problems. Remote working fine. USB ports, headphone jack and HDMI ports are working properly. SPDIF ports are not tested yet.But I don't think there will be any problems which will be I facing. HDMI 1 port I am using for my Tata Sky dish which is working fine. HD channels are very good to see. HD Channels 5/5, SD Channels 4/5. Viewing angle only from straight is very very good but from left and right is bad, picture quality turns in little bit whiteness. But it will not affect too much.\nFrom my opinion, you should definitely go for this TV. In this price this is very good TV.

TV resolution often gets Frozen for a while and doesn't even respond to remote button press. Spoke to support and they asked me to reset the device which will wipe all login credentials !! Ahh that's a great solution.\nApart from that TV sound sucks, as we already know it's a 20 watts speaker but no sign of Dolby digital as mentioned on TV box or flipkart website.\nNot sure if remote have issues as it stops responding when we press button in front or from different side (as it's an Bluetooth remote).",

You can't expect better !\nPros\nPicture quality\nSound clarity\nUSB and hdmi ports\nApp support\n\nCons\nConnectivity..\nAnd that's it.\nOnce you connect via Miracast, suddenly tv will hang. But if you exit and redo the same , it will get established. But, this is a minor issue , in view of the price and other advantages.\nFew reviews mentioned the discomfort with the location of USB port, if wall mount is used. But for me it didn't seem so. You can easily reach to the USB ports with (with average sized forearm!) or better to use an extension cable.\nVolume can't be increased more , so if you are a high volume lover , go with additional sound bar. You will love it...\n\nOverall, it's just a beauty ! Price worthy and value for money ! Go for it.. I am updating it after one month of use .",

You should receive a call in morning next day. Avoid calling many times to the person to avoid irritation on his part.\n\nEnsure to take a video when installation person is opening the box. In case of issues it may help. Do take extended warranty.\n\nOverall good experience. Thank you Flipkart. \u2764",

Its connectivity is good but if you connect this TV with a new device then it will take some time but when your device is saved then it won't take that much time to connect. Its design and built is just awesome, it has a slim and sleek design and very less margins at all the four sides that will give you a proper big screen view.

So I don't like built in speaker sound. So I got f&d 3800x 5.1, put 2 surround rear speakers on my bed side tables and OMG, NOW I have got theatre like sound experience with this tv.\n\nConnectivity: Awesome, chromecast works flawlessly, bluetooth supports wireless earphones, data saver is good.\n\nFor Gaming: I use PS4 Pro, It supports 4k with HDR on PS4 too!!!\n\nMotion smoothening: it's awesome, makes your low frame video look like high frame one. Awesome for 30fps games, feels like 60 while motion smoothness is on.\n\nBest TV EVER",

            "Hi am posting this detailed review after using it for 1 week\n1. picture quality is awesome, 4k plays very smooth, unfortunately, there is no much 4k content available\n2. connectivity is good, no issues, still am surprised why so many people complained about connectivity\n3. there is no issue in casting it will get cast just in seconds, use miracast app. I read several people has issue with casting, I suggest all use miracast app\n4. sound quality is good bass needs some improvement but still its good at this price range, Dolby sound is really good to make sure you are playing Dolby enabled content, youtube mostly plays stereo sound try to play content on Hotstar or prime video to experience true Dolby effect.\n5. Google data saver is really awesome which reduces the data usage and shows the data alert\n6.everything is perfect, I dint find any con's at the price level, overall good buy,\n7. installation was done the same day of delivery, additional 500 has to be paid for wall mount\n8.This tv isn't displayed in any of the Tv showrooms, if this tv kept for compression no other brand tv's would sell, Tx to Mi\n9. Thanks for making it till the end, Good ahead and purchase it",

When you switch off the TV it directly goes into shutdown mode and restarting again takes 20-25 Sec. There should be an in-between step of switching off the screen. My earlier VU TV had this.\n2. There is no mute button on the remote and you need to reduce the volume completely to mute it.\n3. Due to extreme picture resolution the literature content on the TV is too small.\nEyes are strained(Some of the foreign languages subtitles on Netflix and Hotstar.)\n4. Some setting issue for me when watching 4K video on Netflix. Overall screen seems to be dull especially when viewed during day time.Tried manual settings , but not much improvement.\n\nOtherwise.

            "Everything is good but, Three cons are there.\n1. Wifi connectivity : it sometimes doesn't work i.e even if we connect an wifi network it says no internet and stops working.\n2. Sound : only music audio is good & while coming to speech audio its very low. it lacks a balance between both audios. It should come with an proper equaliser.\n3. Google assistant : it doesn't even work. It doesn't even recognise your voice properly. Should optimize it thorough next updates.",
            "As of now this TV looks good. picture quality is quite good. sound quality is decent or OK. Remote and TV build quality is good. Connectivity is bit slow. TV reboot takes about 1 minute. All communication ports are given on RHS of TV panel. TV installation was quick and scheduled very next day of delivery.\nThere is no optical output port given in this TV, which is very big disappointment. Also only TV power cable comes with this TV. No other cables or wall mount bracket is supplied in the box. TV Remote comes without battery (keep 2 nos. AAA battery ready with you before installation guy comes at your doorstep) . Mi tried to cut every single penny they could save.\nThere is nothing very fantastic about this TV, which could give edge over other brands, but Overall this TV looks good deal for me.\nAlso buying 3yr TV protection will ensure which-ever brand you choose, will survive for at least next 3 years.\nI dont think brand name matters these days. Better to go for best price deal with additional TV protection plan.",

You can literally feel that it is Dolby digital sound.. you can use this TV and create a home theatre by buying extra MI speakers with it. The screen is kinda pretty big but in a good way.

If this is your first 4K tv then go for it. User interface of patchwall is easy to navigate. Time lag to start apps/swich windows is there. My other tv of LG is definitely far better than this but as a secondary tv this is good. Don't forget to but MI IR cable to operate set top box using mi tv remote. If your are looking for best picture quality, best sound etc then LG/Sony should be in your mind. I would still recommend this tv due to overall price and performance.",

Sound is good but connect with a sound bar to get cinematic experience. Remote is basic with dedicated Netflix and Prime video buttons. Viewing angles are ok but when you watch the tv from sitting on ground or lying over couch you will notice that the black is not true black.\n\nThe only pain after buying this tv is accessing the ports. You cant reach the ports if you did the wall mount. Hdmi ARC sometimes work other Times it wont. So I tried to connect my sound bar through optical cable but that port is not at all accessible, so I connected sound bar to Set up box. Sound modes are preset no much change you can notice even with tuning those. Written as TruHD and Dolby sound compatible but it sounds like some normal speakers.

First off, the HDR performance is terrible. It is an HDR TV only for namesake. Second, there are 4 horizontal lines visible on the panel whenever it is displaying solid colours. the lines are very faint but noticeable and once you seem them, its difficult to unsee and becomes a constant irritant. Third off, the backlight is erratic as the top half refuses to switch on and requires multiple restarts of the TV set before it starts working.",

Definitely a good upgrade over my TCL Full HD..Blacks are not as dark as Samsung VA monitor..Color vividness is little less when viewed from side angles. Android OS takes a bit time to load up on starting up but works pretty fast once loaded. Does not allow to change picture and sound settings while viewing online content and everytime have to come on to the home screen to make any changes..that's more of a drawback for Android OS.. Sound quality is decent and can get loud enough for a mid size drawing room..Vocal clarity and mids are sharp..bass is low as expected from a TV..got a Panasonic Soundbar for better sound.. Configuring HDMI Arc is a little tricky on this and could not detect the soundbar at multiple attempts using different HDMI cables.. Finally got one cable to work with HDMI Arc functionality.. For HDMI Arc functionality try using these steps: detach all HDMI cables and turn off both TV and soundbar and also remove from main power supply..keep them shut for more than a minute..now plug in both ends of HDMI cable with soundbar and TV...turn on TV first and then soundbar..if lucky HDMI Arc would work!",

After receiving the tv(OnePlus) I was disappointed too much because it's like they're just take the panel and fix it by glue. Also the built quality was so poor. There was a huge gap between frame and screen.\nPicture quality was not good and also sound quality. So i returned it.\nAnd that's it I bought Mi tv 4x. Trust me it is just worthy.\nFrom picture quality to sound quality everything is very good at this price range.\nNow I'm Fully satisfied. Also there is a no network issue at all.\nLot's of people complained about network issue but in my piece it's okay there is no problem regarding network.\nAlso Tv installation done smoothly.\nSo if you confused between OnePlus and Mi tv\nI'm suggesting you that go for Mi tv blindly.",

            "Most detailed review\n\n--- A could not be better product at the price point for sure ---\n\nIts an LCD pannel with LED backlight and hence it's heavy on power consumption, 105W, which is pretty high for day to day use of a TV. One should try to get a TV with LED pannel in order to stay energy and bill concious. Picture quality is unquestionable. Plays 4K videos like a charm and seamlessly, if your internet is fast enough of course. Sound is decent, not something worth a special mention. No bass at all, neither expected. WiFi connectivity range for this device is just as good as modern day mobile phones, compared to even normal laptops the WiFi connectivity range is much worse. Bluetooth connectivity range is just as normal. I have experienced few small lags, not too frequently. One bug is that while operating with voice command sometimes the TV sound stops to work completely and that is truly annoying. You will have to restart the TV to get going again. Slowness in operation while working with Google assistant is quite noticeable, and not because of internet speed.\n\nOS, UI & user-friendlyness:\n\nMi Patchwall home screen looks charming but I wish it could be more useful like when it comes to switching between apps there should be a button available on the remote to toggle between all running apps at the time like the case in Android smartphones. But truly thats a feature missing in the OS not in this specific TV or Patchwall. Also the recently viewed items section could be very helpful if not for the fact that it does not bring recent items from all the apps, like in my case it only shows the items watched in Hotstar. Also some apps take much longer to load than others like Hotstar is superfast where as Prime Video takes a while. Google assistant and voice search are useful, differently with different apps. Like with YouTube you will not be needing a keyboard ever, the voice search is ok there but with other apps, you can open the app with voice command, but not really search anything within it using voice search. And it's quite silly and weird if you have to type with a remote. This last point need no concern if everytime you cast content from your phone. Built in Chromecast is just awesome. Also using Miracast you\ncan clone you smartphone's screen on the TV which provides great flexibility.\n\nVerdict:\n\nIf you are excited with the concept of Android TV(my case exactly) and on a tight budget also looking for experiencing true 4K, then this the product for you. The trade off is in terns of energy inefficiency and small lags here and there. If your looking for uncompromised quality and performance, well do more research.\n\n! Most important suggestion !\n\nFor on-wall installation do not go for installation by Flipkart/Jeevs. Their service person is less than useless and they charge 500 for the wall bracket which is available online at cheaper price also the quality is better there. Just go for a tabletop installation when Flipkart installation team approaches you and afterward mount it on wall yourself or get help from local electrician. Much better option in my opinion.",

However in TV YouTube app too it's not supporting HDR.\nAlso blacks isn't at par with what we expect from HDR panel.\nAlso connection at 4k@60hz isn't supported either.

All features are available that are expected from smart tvs. Extended the warranty with jeeves just to be safe.\nPicture quality is good if you are not nitpicking.

Picture quality is brilliant for the price\n2. Easy to use\n3. Connectivity is good: As people have called out, yes there were initially issues with wifi disconnecting but it gets resolved once you switch to Developer mode (Youtube it!). It's very easy to resolve\n4. Netflix, Prime, Hotstar, YouTube, Spotify, TVF Play, Voot, Zee5 work smoothly (Didn't try, nor ever trying ALT Balaji)\n\nCons:\n1. Volume control is not very good. You have to keep the remote handy if you're watching an action movie to switch between action and dialogue heavy sequences\n2. Mute button would be a great help\n3. In-built media players do not support subtitles if you're playing a media file through hard disk. You can download VLC or Mx Player but those apps are pretty buggy. They serve the makeshift purpose though\n4. Bit of an issue with Chromecast connectivity\n\nAll in all, I would highly recommend this as a bedroom TV or if you have a smaller living room.",

            "Reviewing after 10 days of usage.\n\nDelivery was on time and installation was done within 2 hours of the delivery by jeves services (more than 5 star for it\ud83d\ude00).\n\nDisplay is excellent, even 480p videos on youtube is clearer. Played 1280x544 resolution movie by pendrive which also gives more than what was expected. 4k is also excellent and gives crystal clear viewing experience. Overall, if video has 480p or above resolution, then it is going to be a good experience.\n\nSound quality is ok. Bass is medium. Sound level is good enough for 400 sq ft room.\n\nWith connectivity, there is one issue (not a major one), you can plug 2 pendrive simultaneously only if pendrive is slim like traditional sandisk or hp pendrive which comes in metal. It is due to the place of port is at same site.\n\n\u274e\u274e\u274e Do not open tv yourself after delivery otherwise tv warranty will be void. Only authorised installation person can open it.\n\nPatchwall is good. Navigation is smooth in 95 percent cases. Other issue is with chromecast. You can play youtube, google photos etc easily if your phone is compatible. If your phone supports miracast or mirrorshare then it is going to a problem but it can be removed with the help of some other apps (go to youtube). Now it is all ok with new update.\n\nBuilt quality is good. Main plug wire has enough length. Looks good. Bezzels is ok. Remote is smaller which is good but it has no youtube button.\n\n\n\nOverall, i think it is a tv with 4.5 out of 5 star. Go for it.",

            "Most probably, the MI TV 4X 43 inch is having VA Panel. There is no way to find out whether it is IPS/VA, at least from the Menu. The display is very good, except for the light bleeding in complete dark area or scene. This will not affect your viewing experience. User interface especially menu is a bit tricky. One useful feature is it remembers the last input source. So if you are watching TATASKY-->Switch off --> Switch On -- The source last played will be selected by default. HDMI ARC is working fine, but getting the ARC through the Yamaha Receiver (HTR3067) was a herculean task. Android TV is good. Prime Video starts and plays without any hiccup from the Remote. I have got it on the first day sale for Rs.24000/- (ICICI BANK OFFER). The TV is total value for the money. Esp 4K HDR 43 inch display at this price with reasonably good build quality is excellent. Reduced one star because of the basic remote (No mute button). If you switch off from Remote, the TV shuts down (No standby) and restarts from the scratch if you switch on again. I heard that the you can take it to standby mode through voice command, yet to test that part.\n\nBut very important feature is Google-chrome cast but in MI 4x-pro it not comes with the product it self .
