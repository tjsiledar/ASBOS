Bezel is very thin so that u will get a complete view of your screen\n4. Sound system looks great. Dolby Support given was an added advantage\n5. Getting a Quality product at this price range is great\n6. Value for the money you spent.\n\n\nCons\n1. Bit of connectivity issues but after usage it was working fine now.\n2. It's not a 4k TV (but I know expecting 4k at this price range is not good)\n\nDelivery\nAfter Delivery it took 5 days to get my TV installed. Worst ever experience from Jeeves team.I was keeping the product idle for the past 5 days and finally it's ready now. That too wall mount not done from the installation team.\n\nApart from installation issues. Product is completely great... I am very well satisfied.",

            "Review of Realme TV 32inch(80cm)\nDisplay- 9/10 Almost Same as most of the TV'S like, Mi, Motorola, slightly better for the Croma boost\n\nSound- 8/10 Best in the segment, 24W speakers with dedicated twitter, but if you table mount it, in high sound it may sound stirring a little, so wall mounting will be best.\n\nSystem- Stock pure Android nothing extraordinary Android 9, keeps the apps in the memory, Con here is you can't mute the system click ting ting sound, latest security patch, everything works fine.\n\nGaming- Works just fine so stuttering or lagging.\n\nChromecast- Works superbly well\n\nMobile Screen mirroring- Works good, no complaint\n\nRemote- Best in the segment, dedicated Netflix, prime video, YouTube, Assistant button with mute button and input source button.\n\nOver all review- Better than Mi Tv, Motorola and Vu for the price.\n\nRight now if you want best speaker with good display and better remote control, you should go for it.\n\nOverall rating- 8.5/10.\n\nAlso the jeevas(installation) guys are very helpful and well mannered, trained.",
            "Lovely product for the price. The display (32\" model) is bright and visible in a well-lit room and the sound is good as well. Chromecast works flawlessly right out of the box. Note that only the smaller one comes with RCA jacks, which is a boon for those stuck with set top boxes that lack HDMI. There was an update with the May Security Patch (nearly 1 GB) waiting to be installed. Together with the Extended Warranty by Jeeves, this is a strong first offering from Realme.",

            "Worst experience ever from Flipkart. Received defective product. On first time installation by Jeeves brand authorised technicians the TV does not switched on. So, raised the issue and asked for refund. Then before returning the product another technician came to check the product. At that time the TV got switched on so my return/refund request was cancelled automatically by Flipkart. Then after raising so many time request for visit of brand authorised technicians for installation of TV finally the technician came to install the product but at that time again the TV doesn't switched on. It's almost a week my TV was just in a box in ideal condition and I am watching the box instead of TV programs. Now, hoping that my product get early replacement and I may get a good working TV.\nGot replacement of the product. Having some issues with screen mirroring. While screen mirroring it shows message that the TV and the mobile device should have to be connected to same internet connection or say same Wi-Fi. But if we do not have any other internet source otherthen mobile then how can it is possible to connect both the device to same Wi-Fi ? Because in any mobile device we can't switch on hotspot and wi-fi simultaneously. So, I think realme should have to send a software update in which the TV should search the mobiles Wi-Fi and then it was possible to connect it with mobile device. So, Realme should have to do something in this regards. Also same issue was faced by me in my mi 4a pro tv in starting period. Then after I suggested same as explained above to them & they sent the software update. After that update the issue was resolved. So, team of realme should have to work in that direction.",

Thus supply was given from other socket.\n2. After installing LED unit is sliding in left n right direction even with light touch resulting feat of falling down, and I fixed this lapse with a small piece of thermocol on both sides.\nSo your installation needs much improvement up to the satisfaction level of the customer.\n\nThanks n regards",

            "The Tv has been Around 10 months and to be honest it's my opinion. At the start I enjoyed the tv very much although picture quality was average but i was impressed by the price range. So i Bought two of them. After seven months one of them got pixel damage and tv started flickering and it heats up so much that a melted spot on screen was visible due to intense heating. I contacted realme support, they always say that they will try to resolve. But it's about three months now(and in my place there's no lockdown too) the guy doesn't pick up the calls and trying to avoid as much as possible. Now four months will pass by and still there's no response. So think wisely before buying because their customers support is really big thing to deal as the responses are really slow from the technical support team. I am a realme user since three years and it's the second time I'm facing such an issue.\nHope this helps \ud83d\udc4d",
