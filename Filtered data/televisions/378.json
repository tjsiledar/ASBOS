            "its a good tv in the price range. far ahead of existing MI,TCL and all other tvs of this price range. color is awesome, contrast level is also very good. it offers extra picture enhancements like live color, black correction etc. picture wise no complains. many ppl wrote its a VA panel has viewing issues but trust me its awesome to watch this tv.\nSound is awesome, my hall is 22*18ft and sound is nowhere less in any corner, dont expect it to be like hometheatre. i did not face any connectivity issue yet but yes, it takes almost 1 min to get all the connection ready which means if you just start and open youtube it will not connect after 30-40 sec it starts all connection.\nsome thing Nokia may improve :\n1. I personally dont like the surround sound feature as as soon you make it On the bass vanishes.\n2. frame rates could be better like if it gets an update like MEMC or motionflow technology of Sony it would be an awesome deal. currntly it is also good\n3. 5G wifi is not supported only 2.4G is supported\n\nGo for it if you dont want to spend 1.25 lakh for Sony\nCheers!",
            "During 2020 big billion days i bought it.After so many research ....( I was planning to buy a Sony TV... but we can blindly save a lot of money if you go for Nokia with same config.)\n\nGuys...I\u2019m sharing my feedback after 30 days of usage.\nTV clarity , design & sound everything is good ( you don\u2019t even need external speaker). Delivery was super fast .\n\nMy installation agent was very hurry & rushing.. which makes me uncomfortable. Except everything is good at this moment. Thank you Flipkart \u2764\ufe0f",
            "The TV is just awesome, don't believe in any roumors it works like a charm. Picture quality and sound are unmatched in this price range.\nThe issues which this TV had earlier\n1- Wifi issue : This is fixed via an update (though it was possible to do manually )\n2- Tv reboot : This only happens when u play Dolby vision HDR videos and that is due to slow internet speed, I have 20 mbps wifi plan and it only buffers in Dolby Vision HDR 4k videos but when i pause the stream for 15-20 seconds it works like a charm so a solution to this is to have good internet speed 40mbps recommended.\nI didn't find any issues with wall mount as well, the sound is simply breath taking i never increased the volume to more than 25% its that loud and crisp. Considering playing 4k videos it works beautifully on all ott platforms like Netflix, not having Dolby vison and dual band wifi doesn't make any difference as the picture quality is excellent even without Dolby Vision for a normal user you simply cannot find any difference in Dolby vision 4k HDR video and a normal 4k HDR video and single band wifi works like a champ no issues faced as of now (except Dolby Vison enabled 4k HDR videos on youtube), rest all 4k HDR videos stream without any issue even with 20mbps speed (on youtube and all ott platforms).\nComing to setup box i have Tata sky setup box and believe me even sd channels look brilliant (recommend viewing distance more than 5 feet), Haven't tried hd channels on tata sky yet.\n\nMy conclusion is just go for it without any second thought, 50\" variant is much better than 43\" in both picture and sound.",
            "After Lot of Search i Choose this Tv and it's Very Good Decision for me and My Family.\nEvery one is Happy with Tv.\nSound is very Good\nPicture quality is awesome\nConnectivity is superb over mobile Data and WiFi also\n\nBut Only one things is not good it's Installation the person is came and he was in hurry so he didn't give proper time for demo.\nEven i feel tv is not Proper install on wall mount.\n\nOther wise almost 5 out of 5",
            "I start with cons as pros are everywhere.\nCons:\n1. Panel don't have good viewing angles especially in bright daylight conditions, u can see lots of reflection if you are sitting slightly on left or right.\n2. Don't support 5Ghz wifi, so my wifi do have 5GHz with 100 Mbs but this TV connects to 2.4GHz having 40Mbs speed, you can still watch 4K content, but I noticed it's not super smooth, also live HD channels viewing experience is not that great.\n3. Sound quality no doubt is good, but sometimes you feel there's a need for external sound bar n sub woofer.\n\nThat's all, I have given it 4 star just because of its value for money, I can't find a TV under 40K giving this much features.\nIf nokia can improve on first 2 points, there's nothing much left to argue to be honest.\n\nSo whom I should recommend:\nIf you have a closed room, with minimum sunlight, this panel display works for you. I have added pictures, refer them.\nAlso if you have wifi speed of > 40 mbs at 2.4GHz, this TV displays smoothly.\n\nHope this helps, I have added pics with 4K video running at 90 degree n around 140 degree, check them out.",

For the asking price..it is a good deal. I hope it works the way it is working for at least 5-6 years\nReview after using it for couple of months\nPicture quality is good...but speakers are gone now....dont know what happened...audio quality and volume is like 50% less now. I never had to used it above 30% vol..but now..even at 70% vol is very low. Even my phone sounds louder than this now\nPathetic purchase",

Excellent display of 4k content with great contrast and quality\n\nAlthough slightly pricey when compared with other QLED counterparts like TCL, 1+ but can be justifiable for the amazing sound system offered (especially for 65\" - 48W output is awesome)",

Issue resolved.\n\nOverall fantastic smart 4k LED TV, very much comparable with big brands.",
            "After 20days suddenly the screen is not turning on . Power led is on, but when i try to on the tv it's get a blink in the screen and turning off again. I raised a complaint with flipkart.have to see what they going to do.I bought on the first sale day. The delivery was very quick ( one day delivery mine not being a metropolitan city) . Installation was also quick the very next day. I am satisfied with the picture quality and sound. Great value for money. Should look into durability and performance as the time pass. I see the tv is hanging some times and i have turn it off and again turn on the tv . I don't know whether it can be rectified by software updates. Any one facing the issue ?. The tv is a bit slow. It is hanging at moments.",
            "I bought this TV after a lot of comparison for almost 3 months. Finally manage to buy this one. Using it for the last 10 days and it's a super tv. No negative points so far. Looks wise it elegant. Very good quality picture and sound quality. Very happy with my purchase. Thumbs up for Nokia TV.",
            "Perfect TV in the offered price range. Very good features and easy to use. Onkyo speakers are really very impressive.",
            "I was waiting for a tv for so long that was the same price as the chinese tv like mi and realme but wasn't chinese. This is a perfect budget tv, good picture quality, sound output is also good. This is the best budget tv, get's the job done nicely",
            "I have used for one & half months The Nokia TV absolutely do not have any problem it is one of the best buy. However, the remote consumes more energy as I have compelled to replace new battery cells with in a month and a half. The supplier is very good in keeping up the time of delivery, and responsive to the complaints I thank him for immediate reply and service. I recommend this product based on my usage and observation. Thanks for the supply of good product Flipkart.",
            "Delivery and Installation done earlier than the assured date. Thanks to flipkart delivery and installation team for the safe delivery .\nThe TV looks very beautiful and premium.\nDisplay is good and 4k contents looks very realistic , HD contents are good and SD contents are poor but its as expected .\nSound is fantastic , feels like we are inside the movie hall. No need for extra sound bar.However with software update the sound level has reduced. Hopefully the next update will take care of this issue.\nThe smart features like , night mode,music mode,sleep timer are really handy. Music mode is really handy i.e tv can be used as BT speaker with tv dispaly off and it saved my extra money on sound bar buy.\nPorts on the back side is bit difficult to reach when wall mounted , however its negligible issue.\nBluetooth , wifi , google voice command works without any issue.\nRemote controller is very minimalist and its manageable.\n\nSuggestion : If you are looking for the big screen with budget buy go for it .\ni have bought the extended warranty just in case if any issue arises and to be on safer side.\n\nThis is too early review, will update the review after couple of months !!!\nThanks for reading my feedback , stay home stay safe .",
            "This is an amazing TV worth every penny... Fast wireless connectivity , good sound quality & amazing 4K experience \u2764",
            "Don\u2019t waste your time reading other reviews. Nokia is still the Best. Perfect TV for Home with perfect picture quality. Onkyo sound is good too. Worth buying in 2021.forget sony lg tvs even mi and other brands.",
            "Writing this after more than one month of extensive use. Got it with a deal at cheaper price. I would say it is the Best TV in the segment. Picture perfect, sound excellent, connectivity no issues. Nokia has done a great job with this TV. I would recommend this to all.",
            "Was very skeptical of buying Nokia tv when have lived in the world of Sony or Samsung. But after watching lot of reviews on YouTube and reading reviews online went for it.\nPicture Quality: Very Good. Netflix or any other UHD content looks great.\nSound: The best sound you can get on a Tv! It\u2019s just too good. Ample bass and loudness, for a small room you won\u2019t need anything else to enhance sound.\nConnectivity: I have not taken DTH connection and everything is working like a charm on wifi\nTotally Recommended",
            "Superb quality and good amzing sound at this price. I loved so much this tv. Thank u flipkart for ur valuable service",
            "I was searching for a TV from so many days. Finally I got this. Actually this is the gift for my Dad and he is happy with it. Everything is great and on top of everything, it comes with integrated sound bar from ONKYO which makes the experience even more enjoyable.\nAt this price point (40K) , you are getting a 55 inches LED 4K UHD SMART TV with integrated sound bar and all features, what more do you expect?\nGreat job Nokia. \ud83d\udc4d",
            "I have been using this TV from around 6 months and during this period, I have tested all the possible combination of system configurations/settings.\nI will explain few of the points briefly:\n\n1. Picture(5/5) - The greatest feature to buy this TV is its picture quality. However, it doesn't have good picture quality by default but after modifying few picture settings, picture quality is really amazing. Its picture quality can be compared with higher price brand TVs. Although it is not an OLED tv but still it provides deep black level in picture. Upscaling is so good that 1080p sometimes feel as of 4K video quality and 720p also looks good.\n\n2. Sound(2/5): Sound quality is off course better compared to TVs without attached soundbar. But it could have been much better as per attached soundbar in it. I have found 3 issues in sound of this TV:\na) No medium level of volume while increasing volume, i.e., either volume will be too low or too loud. After 3-4 points of volume level, it suddenly get too loud on increasing just one level of volume. And I have not got any permanent solution of this issue yet.\nb) Base in sound can be heard only when surround sound is off. When you change surround setting to on, then no base in sound.\nc) While using surround sound, right side speaker volume gets too low compared to left side due to which sound can not be heard from right side speaker in low volume.\nd) Surround sound quality is not as per expectation with attached soundbar as one of the SIMILAR PRICE TV WITH ATTACHED SOUNDBAR(cannot mention name to advertise that tv) provides much better sound(good surround sound quality with base) than NOKIA TV.\n\n3. Connectivity(4/5): With 2.4 GHz, I haven't face any issue in connectivity yet with Jio Fiber. However, 5 GHz should have been provided for long term use.\n\n4. Software(1/5): Software is disgusting. I have observed some issues in software:\na) TV restart suddenly and this issue is increasing day-by-day.\nb) No software update since I purchased this TV. Other TVs are providing software updates regularly even for android 10 but Nokia tv is not providing any update just for fixing sound and software issues. Seems we can' expect issue fixes and android 10 update in Nokia TV.\nc) Sometimes, I notice lag in switching apps.\n\n5. Storage and RAM(2/5): Storage space and RAM of TV is not sufficient for a Android Smart TV. I cannot think of installing games in this TV due to less storage space which is about to be completely occupied with other apps only.\n\nConclusion:\nIf you want TV with amazing picture quality in this price level and you don't have problem for not getting software updates, then only go for this TV otherwise go for similar price TV with attached soundbar for better sound quality and playing games.",
            "I am writing I am writing the review after using the TV for a week. frankly speaking the Connectivity is poor.\nYet i am giving 5 stars as i have seen sony, mi and moto tv having connectivity problem. The picture quality is adorable and the 30watt sound by onkyo givs you a chilling experience.. The remote design could have been better but its decent enough. Overall i am happy with the TV experience and would recommend to people reading the review.",
            "Excellent Picture and sound quality.\nI am in love with this TV. build quality is great...\nBetter than Chinese TV.... Very fast response and easy to connect..",
            "The only reason I preferred this tv instead of MI 55 inch, is because of the sound 48w onkyo.\nAt first when the installation happened and switched on the tv, there are clear black patches around the edges of the tv which looked very dull at edges. Since i had an LG 55 inch before the picture clarity all around the tv was very impressive, so Nokia 55 inch tv you\u2019ll not get that flawless or impressive pic quality feel. I have a 43 inch mi tv which I bought 3 months ago looks more vibrant in viewing and faster response.\nSo if given a choice, I would go buy MI tv instead of Nokia 55 inch. The only thing I\u2019m happy about this tv with is the sound 48W.\nIt\u2019s been a few months since I\u2019ve bought it, & I would say don\u2019t buy this brand. Issues with software and issues with clarity.",
            "Best buy, superb product!!!\nI was upgraded TV from samsung 39\" to Nokia 50\" UHD LED TV, after so many search on google n youtube even on many shopping centers like reliance digital, croma etc i did not found any perfect tv with all features and reasonable price as well. But finally i got my perfect tv with all required features in 4K led tv budget range The NOKIA 50\" UHD LED TV with superb price and discount at Flipcart. Its delivered in just one day and installation also done on next day with demo.\nAfter using since last 2 days i am happy with its superb picture quality, superb dolby digital sound by onkyo, smooth functioning n no lags with android processor till time even no issue found with single band wifi at all.\nI am happy with my decision and this product, Go for it with out any hisitation instead of paying 80/90K with other branded TVs.\nI like it , All the best \ud83d\udc4d",
            "Auto restarts in between though not frequent.\nVideo player does not support fast forward as we needed,\nFine fast forward or rewind is not possible, u can forward 5minutes or more in single click, not less than that..\nU can't jump to a time in movie..\nMany options are missing\nSoud loudness is not good..\nBluetooth connectivity is very poor\nEven though gets connected by repeated attempts to bluetooth audio device , most of the times can't hear anything.\nPairing needs multiple attempts and it is lucky if u are successful in hearing the sound through the device..\nWe will loss our patience..\nUltimately not value for money",

Couldn't expect this crystal clear sound from a TV without any external sound system.\n3. Wide viewing angle. Good visual even if you watch from corner.\n4. Build quality is nice. The TV is good weight and strong.\n\nCons:\n1. Little slower. The software is not smooth.\nNote : Not too laggy but still can be improvised.\n2. Sound control could be improvised. If using 3 little low. When increase to level 4 its high.",
            "colour not closure to nature.When I watch matches(hd) in 65 inch , there is no clarity .\n.No upscale of hd content into 4k which is very important factor esp size is big as in india it will take longer duration for 4k channels.Bigger is not better in TV ..so please have thought on this when u procure TV.. The good part is sound and viewing movies through OTD is crisp..",

            "After doing lot of R&D I pen down on going ahead with Nokia tv 2020. After reviewing the tv thoroughly for almost three days I found this device value for money. Picture quality is crisp and colours looks punchy, blacks and whites are deep and sound is pretty good as this price point.

            "Nokia TV is excellent comparing to other big brands ,\n\nPros:-\nPicture quality is very good\nSound quality is very good , even in low sound you can feel the sound qulity\nAndroid OS is amazing with lot of entertainment apps comparing to other big brands\n\nCons:-\nTV Remote is bit hard one [ comparing to other remotes like firetv box remotes ]\nSometimes experiencing the connectivity issue initially , but it goes of immediately by reconnecting to wifi again\n\nNotes to New Buyers :-\nRemote is combination of the IR + Bluetooth , by default your remote will be working , still you need to connect to Bluetooth of the tv to have a better performance and voice ssistant mode enabled\n\nOverall its an excellent purchase",
            "Pro:\n1. Sound works pretty well.\n2. In this budget picture quality is satisfactory.\n3 Delivery on time.\n\nCons:\n1. Remote quality is very cheap. After using of two months it stops working.\n2. Bluetooth connectivity is very poor.\n3. I got the product replaced but on second peace also found the same issue. In previous product there were dots on the screen.\n4: Google assistance hardly works.\n5. Remote connectivity on Bluetooth is also not good.\n\nOverall a so so product. You should go for it only if your budget is really tight.",
            "The TV is good value for money and good picture quality and sound. However after the android software update my dth dish tv sound stopped working with the TV on hdmi although sound is working with all other TVs so for sure due to the software update the incompatibility issue came up leaving me with no choice but to upgrade my set top box as well.\n\nOverall a good product with good picture and sound.\n\nUpdate : Got the Dth sound working. Go to settings then external HDMI inputs and change to 2.0 from the selected 1.4. This will make the sound work and improve the HD picture quality.",
            "For my experience this tv will satisfy all your needs.. picture quality and sound is excellent in LED segment.. Don't compare with samsung/LG since it's far beyond its reach. Money I paid for tv is valuable.. if you are having good budget then go for qled tv.",
            "Picture quality is good enough and satisfying\nSound quality is also good, very clear and loud enough. Don't expect rich bass from sound.\n\nWhen I switch on the TV, I need to wait for a min so for the time to update to correct current time, and then only internet starts working.\n\nVery small bleeding issue which can be observed when you start YouTube. On a grey background its clearly visible.\n\nI got at 38,999. I guess it was a good deal.",
            "All Apps working after a bit of work around.\n(Reset to factory default and update all apps in play store and then login). Also there is an online update which some users have reported that the problem got resolved after the update.\nSpeakers are excellent. Need some break in time.\nBluetooth songs play well from phone and you will not need additional Bluetooth speakers unless you want thumping bass.\nBuild is also good with solid stand.\nConnectivity is good (Keep Ethernet toggle on although you will not connect internet through Ethernet).\nPicture quality although a VA Panel has very good viewing angles. Deep black and colour reproduction is excellent.\nYou will not go wrong for the price.",
            "Guys, music/sound quality is superb and crispy , and quite loud .. you actually don't need to get a home theatre in your room untill and unless you require super bass..\n\nCost wise quite effective... .\nOnly I cannot find how to connect blue tooth (as it's my first smart tv and just only two days of owning a smart tv, hence I have to learn ,how to operate it ).\n\nWhen you are thinking about smart tv .. always go for NOKIA , with your closed eyes.",
            "3 months of usage..\nGood Aesthetic and nice finish. Wall mount also provided in the kit.\nSound: It is the top feature in this TV. Different options provided based on TV MOUNTING.\nPicture: 4K... We can feel the difference when we see 4k videos...\n\n\nThere is a lag/delay in getting exit from an app.\n\nInitially prime app didn't get logged easily, we need to update the TV for prime login. Hope it got resolved in new batch.\n\nI have completely satisfied with this TV so far.",
            "I got damaged panel with back light issue. Also the display light was getting off automatically. After replacing the TV I have received new TV. This time everything is working fine. Picture quality, sound, connectivity, outer look very good at this price. I am not satisfied with the moving videos like live sports. Otherwise it is a good TV in this price.",
            "I'm switching from my normal Samsung LED to this and Picture/Sound Quality is Awesome. After comparing with Realme new Tech SLED and I found NOKIA is better in terms of sound/picture quality(what else you will expect from a TV) 4K video's in YouTube plays without any issue. We can verify when we have 4K channels available. Dual band Wi-Fi is missing. But connecting the Direct Connect cable should solve the problem, no lagging.AIDA64 shows 160dpi.But not sure if that's true.SD channels are not that great. HD channels working OK and you have to spend more money for the channels though. Google assistant works fine. They should have added YouTube/Prime buttons in the remote. Fast and smooth navigation is really good. Bluetooth headphones connects without any issue. But you have to come out to the settings to pair for the first time. No idea about NOKIA/flipkart Aftersales service. I will post another review after rigorous tests.\n\nUpdate 0n 8th Nov\nNo parental controls disappointing!!\nGoogle assistant stopped working gives error as not ready",
            "I am happy that I bought this nokia 50 inch TV. I had placed order for mi tv and then cancelled the order for mi and took this TV. Picture clarity is superb. Sound is very clear, crisp and audible. The most important fact is the price. There is almost no difference between the price of mi and nokia but nokia tv is a far better product.",
            "Just loved it... Nokia has a brand image as a cellphone company. It has done really good in its television section as well. Sound & picture quality is just mesmerizing.. but needs to work on their connectivity issues.",
            "Audio and video of the TV was super... The Android system was lagging I was satisfied by the TV as I am DTH user presently.... Build quality of the TV was very very good.... Compact please give regular updates of software and connectivity improvement I would recommend 5 star..Mind blowing picture quality hope update for smart player for smooth fast forward in playing movies. Thanks to both Flipkart and Nokia",

WHICH IS REALLY BAD",
            "Best decision ever, writing this review after 4 to 5 months of usage. For human eyes you won't notice this tv doesn't have Dolby vision, it's so good. . Even though single band wifi, it doesn't disappoint. If u have good Internet then it would play even 4k without any lag. After last updates sound issue is solved even at minimum points 5 or 6 fills the room .sound is loud and with good clarity. Only point in surround sound option bass reduces but stil it's good. For a normal person who just enjoy only songs videos wil be happy. There is no issue with casting and connectivity. Not sure of gaming as I don't use tv for this. Instead of zee5 hotkey , could have been for prime or YouTube.but it doesn't matter.",
            "I never thought that a smart TV could be so great like this, using Nokia 50 inch Ultra HD Smart TV for one year, I am now so much fascinated that no more TV can be called stupid box, its really taken all what needed. The biggest benefit of this Nokia TV that it is a big screen and also a clear skin, no issue to play 4K clearly and vividly, sound quality is just awesome and beyond of all I ever experienced early before of this. I can say Nokia has returned market back with this TV after loosing market in Mobile it is may be a turning back..",
            "Better than my previous purchase,i.e., Nokia 55\" Ultra HD(4K) with sound byJBL.\nThere is no need for any additional sound bar or system as it's more than sufficient for my 22/12 living room and believe me it's remarkable.Picture quality is also very good for the money,I have spent.Right now,I am fully satisfied, have to see how it performs in future.",
            "A good product at a REASONABLE good price. I effectively got it for 51300 in the sale and considering the onkyo soundbar it comes with it's a good deal. I will rate the overall experience as 3 as there should be the following minimum requirements\n\nHLG SUPPORT\nDOLBY ATMOS\nDOLBY VISION\nMEMC\nDUAL BAND WIFI.

The thin vessels give a great feel to the overall package.\nThe ports are ergonomically placed on the right side corner making it easier to change wires.\nThe display quality is very good... And the sound is awesome. Could be a little louder but does the work with great acoustics and a decent bass and treble.\nOverall it's a good package.... Go for this as compared to other Chinese brands. No connectivity issues whatsoever. Wifi single band runs 4k videos without any lag.",
            "Absolute value for money, excellent product, classy design , nice premium look and finish , easy and fully featured small remote, worth it , 5 star rating on all fronts , display, sound , connectivity, resolution, all in all fully justified, picture quality is very close to Oled resolution. Congrats to Nokia brand for an awsome product.",

            "Updating my review after getting support from the tech support team - after the software upgrade the sound improved significantly. Bluetooth now connects and no voice break issues, however Bluetooth sound quality isn't great for movie watching, I can't explain but the voice quality looks like its dubbed.... but for normal videos, news, documentaries etc, it's fine.\n\nLetting my earlier review below as is, as people facing similar issue may find it useful. Thanks\n-------- old review below \u2014\u2014\u2014\nPicture quality is decent considering its price, however sound is not as great as the company claims about it's Onkyo speaker.\n\n1. Sound gets too loud even at 10-15% level and it goes from very low to very loud with just one level up. So too loud for night viewing. If u go low one level u won't hear the sound and one level above it will be too loud.\n\n2. Bluetooth headphones don't work properly with this tv. I have 3 Bluetooth headphones all work absolutely fine with my laptop, phone, pc and tablet but all 3 have major voice quality issues and connection keeps breaking. Basically you won't be able to use Bluetooth headphones at all. Calledi? customer service and they said its a known issue and they can't do anything about it.\n\nTo summerize, picture quality is decent and sound quality is also Ok not great but other sound/bluetooth related issues make the experience bad.",
            "This would definitely be one of the best purchase I've ever made.\nThe sound quality is simply too good. You can't get this sound even with a qled 1lacs worth of TV. The Onkyo Sound bar is too loud and clear and a great bass thump.\nThe tv has a music mode where the display switches off and just the music plays can be done even with youtube.\n\nThe best part is you can just connect it with your phone's bluetooth and play music even while keeping the screen off.\n\nOnly con I could find was \"missing the 5ghz wifi support\"",

Nokia unveils its bar at led tv with stylish panel and high resolution picture. I can't even ask for more. Truly u won't regrets by its spec's.at market best price tag.

            "Flipkart's delivery was fast, and the installation was done in 2 days.The TV is great. The speaker of the TV is very powerful. No external speakers are required for this. The bass is cool. Looking at the price of full mark TV for audio quality. External device also support.\nTV picture quality is not bad but good/average. SD channel appears correct. But better if you take HD channels. screen cast work best befor update, but after the update,cast only work in default app that is fast cast , But YouTube, prime video, Spotify, Netflix, hotstar etc. It works very well in the cast.*If you are watching TV in a mid range for a big hall, then this TV is the best.* Compromise in a few pictures quality.",
            "Overall in this price range this tv seems to be a fair purchase.\n\nPositives:\n1. Usually people complain in budget tv's about brightness. I feel this one has enough to provide quality video output with good brightness.\n2. Onkyo sound bar on this tv is a very good addition. It provides better sound than any other in this price range.\n3. Looks premium\n\n\nNegatives:\n1.approximately 1% of times android user interface wither restarts or does not respond to remote control.\n2. Remote quality in not that great.\n3. Operating system is a little slow. Still usable without getting irritated.",

I purchased 3 years extended warranty as well for safe side.\nPicture quality is good compared to 1 year old 43' Sony TV. outfit is good compare to all the other models currently available in market (around 65k in 55 inch). Google assistance is more sensible compare to my Samsung 80cm (32 inch) HD Ready LED which i purchased 2 months back.",
            "Good choice in this price range. Smart TV life span is about 2-4 years. Then sure it will about to maintenance even if it is sony, now a days. So, within this elapsed price range features, spec and the quality of the panel is good and found okay. Can go for it.",
            "Best tv in the segment. Value for money as you'll get it around 55k during sale. The picture quality is great and sound quality is awesome.

Satisfactory!\n\nBooting time is okay and no complaints about it.\n\nFlipkart installation was good and done in next day after delivery.\n\nNo lagging and performance wise is good.\n\nValue for the money!\n\nCons:\nAs Nokia is new entrant to TV, you can see Software bugs here and there. Most Annoying is channel scan screen that comes during on.\n\nHope in upcoming software releases, Nokia could fix it.\n\nApart from that, accessibility wise Connectivity ports are very difficult to access after wall mounting.\n\nRemote:\nRemote - hot keys for prime and zee5 (seriously ?????!). everything is fine ,except the Power off button in remote only makes TV to standby and need long press to power off.",

            "The name Nokia brought in old memories of their phone which I had used for long time. This however was the reason for me choosing the 65 inch Android TV.\nThe sound system is the strong point, it is distinctly clear. Rightly it was highlighted in the specification and even the label on the TV tells how important it is.\nThe price at which it was offered made it look like a loot. The TV is a right choice for those who are looking for a compact and affordable yet performing android TV",
            "I purchased it after weeks of research, here are my initial Impression -\n1. Excellent software, no lag.\n2. Good picture quality.\n3. Delivered and installed on same day.\n4. Sound is good and loud. But I assume JBL (in 2019 model) is better.\n5. Premium look.\n6. Ports are on one side only.\n7. Super fast casting.\n\nCons:\n1. Nokia or Dixon handed over installation to one company who feels that they are the king in market. I don't like the professionalism of Jeeves team. Suggestion - please stand next to that full time when he install TV.\n\n2. 5Ghz band would be better but I purchased a 600 Rs. Lan cable with it and solved the problem.\n\nFinal verdict - A TV is primarily for viewing, don't go into the trap of Android10, memory size etc etc. This is good value for Money. If not this one, I recommend TCL or LG / Samsung",

It was a small scratch and if I am going to ask for a replacement god knows when I am going to receive it again. Fed up with Flipkart and have decided to live with it. I told the technician the same. I won't recommend buying this TV and if you do, please check the screen carefully for dents and scratches. Ensure all the functionality works before the technician leaves your home. Getting a defective product once is something that can happen to anyone. Getting it three times in a row? Something is really wrong here.",

Picture quality is amazing. Good contrast and sharp imaging\n2. Design of the product along with sound quality is really good.\n3. It is a value for money product at INR 39K.\n\nCons:\n1. Software is slightly slow. Applications take more time to open\n2. Boot time is high\n3. Remote control could have been better with more functions. Connecting to Android TV remote brings connectivity issues.\n\nOverall, a good buy. Definitely recommended.",
            "Really best tv inthis price range , excellent work by flipkart also in terms of fast delivery, installation, sound quality even better than Samsung or Sony.",
            "It is Great product picture quality is amazing and sound quality is super clear within budget price as comparative Other popular Brands I loved it",
            "Value for money for sure. Only issue is the bluetooth connectivity with 4k and also intermittent restarts when the loading becomes heavy, hoping that these software issues will be fixed with some update coming later which am not sure when though. Otherwise a perfect purchase!",

            "Ok",
            "I'll recommend to buy this TV. Amazing, superb. Don't give a second thought on it. Only one thing I feel that could've been better is the sound though it's not bad either but can be enhanced. You'll not get the TV in such price range for 55'TV.\n\nPicture quality - very Good\nSound quality - Good\nBezel view - very Good\nWiFi connectivity - awesome",

            "Wonderful",
            "After a month long research of 55 inch TVs where I evaluated the Motorola ZX pro, Hi sense, Toshiba, Blaupunkt etc I bought this during the July 21 sale. So it's been about two weeks of using the TV. Delivery was next day and install the day after. Having used an LEtv 55 and a Samsung FHD 55 before, I had some reference points to check this against in addition to my research. While it's a bit too early to comment, TV checks out fine as of now. WiFi connection is flawless. Not sure why people want 5Ghz when 2.4Ghz does the job perfectly. 4K video streams instantly and I have not noticed any buffering whatsoever. Android TV works flawlessly too and I have noticed no lag at all. As for the sound, the Onkyo speakers are superb.None of my other more established brand TVs have a sound this good. Colour reproduction is excellent and pictures pop out. There is a sheen/ sharpness in the pictures. I tried all HDMI ports and the USB ports and all works fine so far. I was able to connect a camera to the USB port and the downloaded Google Duo detected it perfectly. As for issues, there was a problem of the TV restarting by itself ( on rare occasions) which resolved upon resetting the TV. I would say for around 37K, it seems a good deal. I have taken extended warranty from Flipkart not knowing long term reliability. While the picture and sound are great, what I like more about the TV is the look of it when switched off. It is aesthetically pleasing with the fabric covered Onkyo sound bar at the bottom and almost bezel less screen it enhances the decor..It is quite thin too. Also, the viewing angles are great and the screen doesn't reflect light abnormally. Need to now see long term reliability. I would strongly recommend this TV..",
            "Sound is good for music , not for other. During music it will be laud and again very low",
            "Pros: LED panel is of excellent quality which provides excellent picture quality especially 4k videos .\nSound: high end QuatroX Onkyo speakers delivers 3d sound, connectivity is also good. No problem,\nRemote is also working properly.\n\nCons: till now no problem",

I researched a lot both in online and offline store for all the brands and finally bought this one and this item did justice to my decision.\n\nPros:\n1. Picture quality is best at this price.\n2. Sound is crisp.\n3. Connectivity is good.\n4. Android tv experience is best felt without any problem.\n\nCons:\n1. After the update, everyone commented about sound to be reduced. I felt the same. Hope it will be rectified with another update.\n2. If you compare QLED/OLED/ Sony high end tvs with this, you won't find the darkest color what they produce. Of course the technology is different and price wise they are providing much better tv panel. So you can ignore this con.\n3. I faced google assistant to be not working for once. Which got handled by resetting the tv.\n\nFinal verdict:\n\nThis is the best budget 4k tv for those who like to binge watch a lot. Price wise this is a good tv which comes with onkyo soundbar fitted. One small suggestion to take 3 years warranty from Flipkart which can be handy in future.",
            "Its a nice purchase at that price. Do not expect it to be better than the other Chinese brands cause it is based on the same technology.\n\nBlack and bright colours bleed when the content you are viewing is not 4K. However, all 4K content runs smooth and with my Jio fibre ethernet i have had no lag so pure viewing pleasure there.\n\nThe Onkyo sound bar is no good and you do not have much sound customization options for it. I personally feel there is too much treble on every setting I have tried.\n...\nREAD MORE",

Luckily i have got this product becoz it's worth to buy on this price and after that sale price was increased by 2000. Now i am coming to product, picture and audio clarity was very good and sound bass was little bit low and overall the sound is good. Picture clarity was excellent at this price. NOKIA TV with ONKYO speaker experience was wonderful experience. As per UHD and HD video was very good in this TV with original bit rate of video playing. So nothing else to say any defects until now.\n\nAnd FLIPKART DELEIVERY very fast and installation also too fast. They delivered before the date and installation was also too quick on the next day of delivery. Thanks to flipkart.",

The design, sound and picture is awesome in this price range. Viewing HD content and listening music is awesome with option to switch off display. Google assistant works great\n\nPlease change your dish box to HD, change the resolution to 1080 from dish box setting, update the TV software & apps, search Google and tune the picture & sound settings for 4K TV, get fibre Wifi connection if possible to experience fullest.\n\nIssues:\nAt times, sound goes off/muted while watching.\nYouTube voice search not working\n\nHope Nokia would fix all issues and come with more new features with Android 10 update.",

Picture and sound quality is excellent for the price. Only minor thing was that it has only USB 2.0 and the remote buttons are bit firm and inconsistent. Else great product for the price.

Very clear and not too much bass resulting in very clear sound output. So a big thumbs up to team Nokia and Onkyo. Just don\u2019t expect that this will be sufficient for party music.\n\nAlso, wish the installation guys were a bit professional, they didn\u2019t want to set up the tv and explain basic functions.
