            "I am a visual effects artist and spent a lot of time to pick this brand over its competitors like I falcon, Thompson, Vu and MI\n\nONE SENTENCE VERDICT-with smart voice control and superior IPS panel this stands out better to closest rivals -I FALCON and VU.so Blindly go for this.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n1.BIGGER THAN YOU EXPECT. Go for this size only if you have a minimum viewing distance of 10 feet. Also keep back light to 50(in settings)to reduce eye strain\n2.RECOGNIZES WORDS EASILY THROUGH VOICE COMMANDS\n3. MX PLAYER,VLC PLAYER etc.-can be DOWNLOADED .though could download NETFLIX,need to check its compatibility .\n4.USB accessibility is excellent. Works fine even if you use any number of pen drives using multi usb hub. Can connect ONLY BRANDED external hard disk too .(EXTERNAL CASING with INTERNAL HARD DISK won\u2019t work)\n5.IPS panel used here is designed by LG which is the best when it comes to screen technology(honestly all IPL panels are designed by LG only)\n6.Package /delivery-PERFECT\n\nFEW TIPS-(not issues since they have solutions)\n\n1.can't access ports after wall mounting with the fittings that came with the TV. SOLUTION 1-can buy an adjustable wall fitting that can be tilted. Costs around 4k +fitting charge. SOLUTION 2-go for table mounting\n2.has only digital optical audio out.so not easy to connect to a budget home theatre which normally has only AUX input. SOLUTION-there are few digital to aux converter(but not branded)\n3.EXTRA TEMPTING MANDATORY EXPENSE- Rs 19300 (almost for all 65 inch TVs you need to consider these) SPLIT UP -stabilizer (vguard digi 200)-Rs.3500,usb extension-100,hdmi 5 meter-300, Bluetooth mouse-500,audio out optic cable surround decoder-2500,2 years additional waranty-4000,tv stand-9000,dedicated harddisk-3400,\nIn addition if you go for a 5.1 home theatre with optical input-15000 to 25000\n4.controlling volume is not flexible at lower levels\n5.rarely voice command will lag .SOLUTION-reboot\n6.accessibility is not so easy initially\n7.true surround is nice ,but believe me, without a surround external speaker system you won\u2019t get surround sound.by default whatever be the sound mode, your TV will only support stereo.\n8.(MIGHT LOOK LIKE A WORTHLESS POINT .BUT...)re packing/transportation will be a big issue.so need to find a place to keep such a huge packing box safely somewhere\n9.if you are looking for a best budget home theatre sound system that supports optical input ,go for Logitech Z906 Surround Sound Speaker System(did a lot research and found it's better than the only other rival SONY .but somehow I ended up buying a Sony system. Reasons explained below)\n\nAFTER 30 DAYS REVIEW\n4k playing flawless at 100 mbps.\nPairing Bluetooth remote - its involves simple steps\n1.long press the remotes home button and left arrow(left side of the navigation button).green light will blink in remote\n2.go to TV\u2019s accessibility menu and could find \u2018pair new Bluetooth device\u2019\n3.new screen is popped showing the TV remote at top right. Just click it(probably with a mouse)\nVoice Controls possible through google smart speaker-the already available voice control option in the smart remote is so amazing .it clearly understands my Indian accent and now one I miss it when I have type things in my laptop and in my office pc. yet an another amazing upgrade is that ,if you own a google smart speaker and linked it to your smart TV, you case use your voice to play a video in YouTube directly, turn off TV etc. just by speaking to your smart speaker (no need of remote).however turning on TV is not working though voice command\n5.1 Home theatre sound support-since I didn\u2019t had the optical out I decided to upgrade my surround system (only after some hectic experiment fails using some unbranded sound decoders in local market).after a thorough research on a budget home theatre which had an optical support ,only two home theatres stayed in my options .one is SONY (almost all models) and the other is Logitech.\nI bought Sony since it came with a blue ray player,smart hdmi(can use TV Bluetooth remote itself to control both home theatre and TV)and more importantly every time you switch on the TV, the sound system also smartly turns on and you feel like its clubbed as a single unit .\n\nBut honestly the other option Logitech Z906 is better in terms of sound quality ,custom control and also in price.\n\nUse mobile as a Remote Control- by installing app \u2018Android Remote\u2019\nREASON FOR ONE STAR LESS-\nhave to reduce one star for 2 main design issues that should have been easily fixed by MARQ.\n1.PORTS CANT BE ACCESSED ONCE WALL MOUNTED.\n2.NO AUX AUDIO OUT.\n3.interactive adjustment of sound/video is bit clumsy (very annoying)\n4.found only inbuilt media player is delivering 5.1 channel sound.(not supporting few formats).not happening with VLX or MX player\nPlease like my review if you found this review usefull",
            "I was looking for a decent quality big-sized TV with decent sound output and play the latest codecs in 4k and available at a decent rate.\n\nAfter losing half a lakh on a premium phone which worked exactly for 2 years, I was hesitant to buy a TV at premium rates (1k or more) and no guarantee of working post 3-5 years.\n\nAfter referring to Vu, Mi, TCL, Thomson, Blaupunkt, I felt this Marq offering was the best of all I want. It was advertised as a 65 inch 4k TV with Dolby surround sound. I also came to know that it had a quad core processor with 2.5GB RAM. That was something I was looking forward to. I had tried playing 4k HEVC encoded videos on Android boxes and phones and I found that only premium boxes or Snapdragon 845 phones can fluidly play 4k HEVC files. I assumed that if the player can play this file, other files will be a breeze with no lag.\n\nThe TV was huge compared to my existing 42 inch TV(of course) and no video or photo could justify the actual size.\n\nWhat I liked :\nIt plays the 4k HEVC files flawlessly. No issues at all. Really beautiful video output. YouTube videos too stream beautifully.\nThe speakers are front-facing and so, thankfully, are loud and in-your-face whether the TV is wall mounted or on stand. Output was loud as I couldn't watch movies more than 3-4 volume level (about one-tenth of 100% sound) without my mother yelling me to turn down the volume. And the TV is in a huge open drawing room!\n\nWhat I disliked :\nNo support to Netflix or Amazon Prime, my two primary media streams, in any way (direct or side loaded). I thought it might be an issue with DRM, but it is an L1 Widevine device!\nAlso, ineffective support for other apps, looks like Marq intentionally doesn't want us to load further or alternate apps. For eg, ES Explorer doesn't detect some pendrives on a multi-USB hub, and so does VLC. Chrome browser, Amazon music, Saavn cannot be found in store. How can this TV be called a Google-certified Android TV? Attempting side-loading these apps also seems futile.\nDefault and only available media player doesn't support skip-jumping to certain points in a video(like in PC's or as air mouse). It also doesn't have any options for customisation. I really needed the player to remember last played position in videos and am forced to play it from the beginning. The fancier remote can only fastforward to 32x. However, to it's favour, the less fancier remote has a blue button which could take you to an entered position (hh:mm:ss) in the file.\nI was told (and shown) by the Jeeves rep that I can connect Bluetooth mouse to the TV and move to required positions in video file, but I later found that it's a random occurance. Sometimes the mouse click is accepted, sometimes it's not! I even bought a wireless keyboard mouse specific for smart TVs, but not all buttons on that also were detected. It didn't skip-jump either. If anyone gets a 100% compatible wireless solution, please intimate me too or put up in your reviews.\nNo S/PDIF.\nI was not able to cast any of my phones onto the TV and after lot of experiment was able to cast using my phone's hotspot, even though both phone and TV were in full range to an external WiFi! Again, casting was jerky for some Netflix and Amazon prime content and I was not able to appreciate subHD content (my phone's unfortunately had L1 Widevine level) on a 4k 65 incher!\n\nI was not able to fully appreciate the HDR mode as I found normal 1080p video more colourful and deeper than 4K HDR of the same file and format! [Of course, I had enabled HDR in picture options]\nNeither was I able to appreciate content less than 1080p. Does this TV really have video upscaling or am I too discerning?\nI was also not able to appreciate the Dolby effect, even after downloading content from the Dolby site itself. Some surround effect was felt though, nothing unanticipated. All sounds was, as the speaker was, from the front direction only.\nThat's all for now, folks. Will keep you updated after few months of usage. As of now, I'm satisfied with the quality and more than satisfied with the performance at this price.\nBTW, I had a few queries regarding the functioning and limits of the TV, which I asked vice email to Marq. They just arranged for a service rep visit.\nThe queries were :\n1. Regarding a compatible keyboard/mouse for jumping to portions in a video. I was not able to do it with wired/wireless or even air mouse!\n2. Wireless streaming from phone is just buffering and hanging sometimes. it also exits this mode during hang.\n3. After the recent update, power off on remote actually shuts down the TV, instead of just offing the display, which was fast. this is now an actual shutdown and restart (talking huge time)\n4. I asked if Netflix & Amazon Prime support be ever extended to this TV, as it is Widevine L1.\n5. No other regular app works properly on the TV, other than the default installed ones. No Chrome, Google photos in the Play Store, VLC, Kodi, ESExplorer don't detect pendrives/video files on a Google certified Android 8 TV!\nNo reply received yet.\nAnother issue which cropped up recently... sometimes, when the display is off (remote OFF), the TV switches ON on its own! We generally don't switch off the power on the TV at night, and next morning the TV is ON. Is it updating...or... power fluctuations... or... possessed \ud83d\ude44",
            "Pros:\n*MarQ by Flipkart....It's really an excellent 65inch TV at this price range and it stands ahead of its competitors from other brands.\n*The most realistic viewing experience with a vivid picture quality and immersive sound experience is guaranteed.\n*It works on a superior type of search engine with highly advanced processor and an updated android version.\n*Connection is hassle free as it has 3*HDMI for connecting your possibilities of external devices.\n*Higher contrast ratio enhance the depth of pictures and HDR works excellent for this 550nits of brightness provider.\n*Better Ram specification and an internal storage makes your work easier.\n*Best view can be obtained in a distance of 15 to 20 feet range.\n*Installation is provided at a faster rate after delivery.\n*Installation of voltage stabilizer must be done to extend the life of TV(V-Guard Digi 200) Recommended.\n\n\ncons:\n*Screencasting is possible only if u own a Chromecast device or an WiFi router.\n*Heating issues are observed even if the TV is working for an hour.\n*It's a little harder for connecting cables if the TV is wall mounted.\n*Universal remote is not provided as it makes too many remotes to be handled.\n*User interface seems to be outdated.\n\nFinally you can buy this product as it doesn't fail to make u happy at this price range.Its an excellent product at this range.",
            "looking Stylish, Picture quality Good, Sound system is Rocking,No need of Home theatre .. Stunning performance ..Every penny is worthy, paisa vasool product .I blindly beloved flipkart so I purchased, after receiving this product fully satisfied.. thank you so much flipkart",
            "wonderful quality sound quality is very good picture quality is wonderful the best",
            "I'm using this TV for about 10-12 days and I want to tell u guys some things\n:::::::::::pros::::::::::::\n1) amazing picture quality\n2) superb sound quality\n3)silky smooth interface with no lags\n:::::::::::cons::::::::::::\n1) corners of the screen has little light effects and it can be reduced by changing backlight from 100 to 50 it gives more punching colours\n2) in connectivity there is no AV out ,if I have RCA type home theatre like I have then it's a problem, u need to buy digital to analog audio converter (Amazon) or I have Bluetooth it works great\n3) talking about Bluetooth , flipkart says it has lip sync technology and it reduces audio delays when connected to Bluetooth and cabled devices and it work but only with YouTube, Amazon prime, Netflix (installed from HDD) and Zee5 ,like only streaming apps it works but when u play movies from hdd and it doesn't works at all's audio delays like about 2-3 sec and even with the Tata sky channels it delays like hell ,I have Bluetooth in my home theatres\n4) talking about accessibility u cant access media from hdd with other apps like VLC player ,MX player and Archos player (Access denied) and this apps can solve audio delays and it has all the codecs support because this TV don't have DTS audio support and most of the 4k movies have DTS audio, we have to play movies from inbuilt multi media player app only by converting movie from laptop\n\nFlipkart plzz solve this audio delays issues atleast give audio delays options for Bluetooth only s/pdif audio delays option is available\n\nThank you",

            "1 Years Review- So I've used this tv for an year now and my views on it have changed over time. I rated it 5 stars as soon as I got it because it felt like a great deal and screen was bright and nice.\n\nA year of usage, and I started to see the flaws over time. Things I should have considered more:\n\n1. Bad software- It is an android tv but not a good one at it. No Netflix or Prime. It reminds me of the early android phones that were in the market, glitchy and bad a UI. The Google voice commands hardly work. Apps don't perform well, requires restarts once in while\n\nI moved to an Prime stick couple of months ago and realised the difference in quality instantly. Just a better and cleaner dash board and UI, no glitches and a far better voice control. That is what I would recommend everyone to do.\n\n2 Sound- It is a powerful speaker, no arguments there. But the volume control sucks. It's either to quite at volume 5 or too loud at volume 6....very frustrating. And I definitely notice the lack of clarity in voice compared to better TV's.\n\n3. Screen- This is a positive. I like the screen quality, bright and sharp for its price point.\nIt says that it has HDR but I don't really see that it videos when compared to a samsung tv. The depth of colours are definitly not on par, but then it is unfair for me to compare it to a tv that costs twice as much.\n\n4. Value for money- It is value for money, if you want a 65 inch 4k tv and are not too particular with software, and use it for general dth viewing, it's a good choice. The other flaws can be overlooked.\n\nIf I had to go back in time, I would not get this tv. Im not the person that changes tv's every couple of years. I will definitely use them for 6-8 years. And for that reason I would spend more and get a better branded tv that will give me a better user experience.",
            "I am a visual effects artist and spent a lot of time to pick this brand over its competitors like I falcon, Thompson, Vu and MI\n\nONE SENTENCE VERDICT-with smart voice control and superior IPS panel this stands out better to closest rivals -I FALCON and VU.so Blindly go for this.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n1.BIGGER THAN YOU EXPECT. Go for this size only if you have a minimum viewing distance of 10 feet. Also keep back light to 50(in settings)to reduce eye strain\n2.RECOGNIZES WORDS EASILY THROUGH VOICE COMMANDS\n3. MX PLAYER,VLC PLAYER etc.-can be DOWNLOADED .though could download NETFLIX,need to check its compatibility .\n4.USB accessibility is excellent. Works fine even if you use any number of pen drives using multi usb hub. Can connect ONLY BRANDED external hard disk too .(EXTERNAL CASING with INTERNAL HARD DISK won\u2019t work)\n5.IPS panel used here is designed by LG which is the best when it comes to screen technology(honestly all IPL panels are designed by LG only)\n6.Package /delivery-PERFECT\n\nFEW TIPS-(not issues since they have solutions)\n\n1.can't access ports after wall mounting with the fittings that came with the TV. SOLUTION 1-can buy an adjustable wall fitting that can be tilted. Costs around 4k +fitting charge. SOLUTION 2-go for table mounting\n2.has only digital optical audio out.so not easy to connect to a budget home theatre which normally has only AUX input. SOLUTION-there are few digital to aux converter(but not branded)\n3.EXTRA TEMPTING MANDATORY EXPENSE- Rs 19300 (almost for all 65 inch TVs you need to consider these) SPLIT UP -stabilizer (vguard digi 200)-Rs.3500,usb extension-100,hdmi 5 meter-300, Bluetooth mouse-500,audio out optic cable surround decoder-2500,2 years additional waranty-4000,tv stand-9000,dedicated harddisk-3400,\nIn addition if you go for a 5.1 home theatre with optical input-15000 to 25000\n4.controlling volume is not flexible at lower levels\n5.rarely voice command will lag .SOLUTION-reboot\n6.accessibility is not so easy initially\n7.true surround is nice ,but believe me, without a surround external speaker system you won\u2019t get surround sound.by default whatever be the sound mode, your TV will only support stereo.\n8.(MIGHT LOOK LIKE A WORTHLESS POINT .BUT...)re packing/transportation will be a big issue.so need to find a place to keep such a huge packing box safely somewhere\n9.if you are looking for a best budget home theatre sound system that supports optical input ,go for Logitech Z906 Surround Sound Speaker System(did a lot research and found it's better than the only other rival SONY .but somehow I ended up buying a Sony system. Reasons explained below)\n\nAFTER 30 DAYS REVIEW\n4k playing flawless at 100 mbps.\nPairing Bluetooth remote - its involves simple steps\n1.long press the remotes home button and left arrow(left side of the navigation button).green light will blink in remote\n2.go to TV\u2019s accessibility menu and could find \u2018pair new Bluetooth device\u2019\n3.new screen is popped showing the TV remote at top right. Just click it(probably with a mouse)\nVoice Controls possible through google smart speaker-the already available voice control option in the smart remote is so amazing .it clearly understands my Indian accent and now one I miss it when I have type things in my laptop and in my office pc. yet an another amazing upgrade is that ,if you own a google smart speaker and linked it to your smart TV, you case use your voice to play a video in YouTube directly, turn off TV etc. just by speaking to your smart speaker (no need of remote).however turning on TV is not working though voice command\n5.1 Home theatre sound support-since I didn\u2019t had the optical out I decided to upgrade my surround system (only after some hectic experiment fails using some unbranded sound decoders in local market).after a thorough research on a budget home theatre which had an optical support ,only two home theatres stayed in my options .one is SONY (almost all models) and the other is Logitech.\nI bought Sony since it came with a blue ray player,smart hdmi(can use TV Bluetooth remote itself to control both home theatre and TV)and more importantly every time you switch on the TV, the sound system also smartly turns on and you feel like its clubbed as a single unit .\n\nBut honestly the other option Logitech Z906 is better in terms of sound quality ,custom control and also in price.\n\nUse mobile as a Remote Control- by installing app \u2018Android Remote\u2019\nREASON FOR ONE STAR LESS-\nhave to reduce one star for 2 main design issues that should have been easily fixed by MARQ.\n1.PORTS CANT BE ACCESSED ONCE WALL MOUNTED.\n2.NO AUX AUDIO OUT.\n3.interactive adjustment of sound/video is bit clumsy (very annoying)\n4.found only inbuilt media player is delivering 5.1 channel sound.(not supporting few formats).not happening with VLX or MX player\nPlease like my review if you found this review usefull",
            "I was looking for a decent quality big-sized TV with decent sound output and play the latest codecs in 4k and available at a decent rate.\n\nAfter losing half a lakh on a premium phone which worked exactly for 2 years, I was hesitant to buy a TV at premium rates (1k or more) and no guarantee of working post 3-5 years.\n\nAfter referring to Vu, Mi, TCL, Thomson, Blaupunkt, I felt this Marq offering was the best of all I want. It was advertised as a 65 inch 4k TV with Dolby surround sound. I also came to know that it had a quad core processor with 2.5GB RAM. That was something I was looking forward to. I had tried playing 4k HEVC encoded videos on Android boxes and phones and I found that only premium boxes or Snapdragon 845 phones can fluidly play 4k HEVC files. I assumed that if the player can play this file, other files will be a breeze with no lag.\n\nThe TV was huge compared to my existing 42 inch TV(of course) and no video or photo could justify the actual size.\n\nWhat I liked :\nIt plays the 4k HEVC files flawlessly. No issues at all. Really beautiful video output. YouTube videos too stream beautifully.\nThe speakers are front-facing and so, thankfully, are loud and in-your-face whether the TV is wall mounted or on stand. Output was loud as I couldn't watch movies more than 3-4 volume level (about one-tenth of 100% sound) without my mother yelling me to turn down the volume. And the TV is in a huge open drawing room!\n\nWhat I disliked :\nNo support to Netflix or Amazon Prime, my two primary media streams, in any way (direct or side loaded). I thought it might be an issue with DRM, but it is an L1 Widevine device!\nAlso, ineffective support for other apps, looks like Marq intentionally doesn't want us to load further or alternate apps. For eg, ES Explorer doesn't detect some pendrives on a multi-USB hub, and so does VLC. Chrome browser, Amazon music, Saavn cannot be found in store. How can this TV be called a Google-certified Android TV? Attempting side-loading these apps also seems futile.\nDefault and only available media player doesn't support skip-jumping to certain points in a video(like in PC's or as air mouse). It also doesn't have any options for customisation. I really needed the player to remember last played position in videos and am forced to play it from the beginning. The fancier remote can only fastforward to 32x. However, to it's favour, the less fancier remote has a blue button which could take you to an entered position (hh:mm:ss) in the file.\nI was told (and shown) by the Jeeves rep that I can connect Bluetooth mouse to the TV and move to required positions in video file, but I later found that it's a random occurance. Sometimes the mouse click is accepted, sometimes it's not! I even bought a wireless keyboard mouse specific for smart TVs, but not all buttons on that also were detected. It didn't skip-jump either. If anyone gets a 100% compatible wireless solution, please intimate me too or put up in your reviews.\nNo S/PDIF.\nI was not able to cast any of my phones onto the TV and after lot of experiment was able to cast using my phone's hotspot, even though both phone and TV were in full range to an external WiFi! Again, casting was jerky for some Netflix and Amazon prime content and I was not able to appreciate subHD content (my phone's unfortunately had L1 Widevine level) on a 4k 65 incher!\n\nI was not able to fully appreciate the HDR mode as I found normal 1080p video more colourful and deeper than 4K HDR of the same file and format! [Of course, I had enabled HDR in picture options]\nNeither was I able to appreciate content less than 1080p. Does this TV really have video upscaling or am I too discerning?\nI was also not able to appreciate the Dolby effect, even after downloading content from the Dolby site itself. Some surround effect was felt though, nothing unanticipated. All sounds was, as the speaker was, from the front direction only.\nThat's all for now, folks. Will keep you updated after few months of usage. As of now, I'm satisfied with the quality and more than satisfied with the performance at this price.\nBTW, I had a few queries regarding the functioning and limits of the TV, which I asked vice email to Marq. They just arranged for a service rep visit.\nThe queries were :\n1. Regarding a compatible keyboard/mouse for jumping to portions in a video. I was not able to do it with wired/wireless or even air mouse!\n2. Wireless streaming from phone is just buffering and hanging sometimes. it also exits this mode during hang.\n3. After the recent update, power off on remote actually shuts down the TV, instead of just offing the display, which was fast. this is now an actual shutdown and restart (talking huge time)\n4. I asked if Netflix & Amazon Prime support be ever extended to this TV, as it is Widevine L1.\n5. No other regular app works properly on the TV, other than the default installed ones. No Chrome, Google photos in the Play Store, VLC, Kodi, ESExplorer don't detect pendrives/video files on a Google certified Android 8 TV!\nNo reply received yet.\nAnother issue which cropped up recently... sometimes, when the display is off (remote OFF), the TV switches ON on its own! We generally don't switch off the power on the TV at night, and next morning the TV is ON. Is it updating...or... power fluctuations... or... possessed \ud83d\ude44",
            "Pros:\n*MarQ by Flipkart....It's really an excellent 65inch TV at this price range and it stands ahead of its competitors from other brands.\n*The most realistic viewing experience with a vivid picture quality and immersive sound experience is guaranteed.\n*It works on a superior type of search engine with highly advanced processor and an updated android version.\n*Connection is hassle free as it has 3*HDMI for connecting your possibilities of external devices.\n*Higher contrast ratio enhance the depth of pictures and HDR works excellent for this 550nits of brightness provider.\n*Better Ram specification and an internal storage makes your work easier.\n*Best view can be obtained in a distance of 15 to 20 feet range.\n*Installation is provided at a faster rate after delivery.\n*Installation of voltage stabilizer must be done to extend the life of TV(V-Guard Digi 200) Recommended.\n\n\ncons:\n*Screencasting is possible only if u own a Chromecast device or an WiFi router.\n*Heating issues are observed even if the TV is working for an hour.\n*It's a little harder for connecting cables if the TV is wall mounted.\n*Universal remote is not provided as it makes too many remotes to be handled.\n*User interface seems to be outdated.\n\nFinally you can buy this product as it doesn't fail to make u happy at this price range.Its an excellent product at this range.",

Things I should have considered more:\n\n1. Bad software- It is an android tv but not a good one at it. No Netflix or Prime. It reminds me of the early android phones that were in the market, glitchy and bad a UI. The Google voice comma...\nREAD MORE",

            "I have been using a 36 in HD TV by Croma for a couple of years before I switched to MarQ 65 in 4K. I am totally into buying branded stuff except for TVs which is one such electronic item I believe is overly hyped by brands and make it really expensive for just the logo some times. Ignore the brand logo on a TV, and there are for sure many TVs that are excellent and at a very good price point. Perhaps, there may be certain features in the branded TVs which as a normal consumer wouldn't notice or matter much.\n\nNow for the MarQ 65 in 4K TV itself. It is an amazing buy. I have seen & read many reviews for TVs by various channels and learned that Mi 55 TV Pro is a good buy",

Technicians from Jeeves were also not aware that this TV does not support these popular apps.\nThe customer service guy Jatin questions me why did you buy this TV when I complained of the incapability of the apps.
