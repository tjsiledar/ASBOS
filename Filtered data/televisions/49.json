            "This is my first Smart TV and probably first detailed review ever.\n\nI bought this TV after a long research and hesitations. I was worried about my TV experience in low budget and I cannot afford LG, SONY and SAMSUNG high end TVs. Low Budget segments from these makes are not upto the mark as per my research. So competition was between either Mi or Vu. Don't compare this TV with QLEDs and OLEDs. They are high quality brand Tvs which require deep pockets too. I, Like many other thought Vu is Chinese brand but I found out an Indian Lady (Devita Saraf) is founder and CEO. I am sure many parts may have been produced in China or elsewhere but still company is Indian and thankfully the TV quality is also very good. I compared it with Mi TV 4 on many reviews and found out that its nose ahead with it.\n\nPROS:\n\n1) DISPLAY : I thought VA panel may not be as good as IPS but display is very good. Much better than Mi TVs which I have seen personally in many locations. Colors are bright, sharp and vivid. Plus it has VOD Upscaler that means SD channels are looking a bit better then other TVs.\n2) ANDROID: System is running smoothly with Android Pie which many told its not the case but in this TV I found out its very good.\n3) BUILD-QUALITY: This is my first big smart TV so I haven't seen other very closely but build quality looks good.\n4) REMOTE: Remote works really fine.\n5) COST: BEST part is the cost. No other TV will give me these much feature and quality at this cost.\n\nCONS:\n1) AUDIO: I wont say its bad but its average audio output. Thinking of attaching it with my speakers.\n2) SOAP OPERA EFFECT: Most apps doesn't have it but I found out JIO Cinema is showing movies in Soap Opera Effects. I am not able to find how to switch off the effects. May be its in App. Don't know.\n\nAll in all I am very happy with the purchase as for people like me its a big decision. I thank you Devita Saraf.",
            "Update 1 : Few days of Usage.\n\n1. Value for money. Hits above it's price bracket.\n2. Fast (2GB Ram), have good internal memory at 16GB.\n3. Happy with the sound quality, it gets loud if you have right audio settings. ( Refer Tech Singh YouTube video)\n4. Tv display is bit flimsy while holding the tv for mounting, but it may be because it is large at 55 Inch.\n5. I sit 8 feet away from my tv and it feels large, like a theatre in here, not sure if that is a good thing for eyes, let's wait and see.\n\nMore updates will come as I use it more.",
            "Great value for money.\nPros-\n4k display is good, pictures look stunning.\n\nSlim bezels and overall premium appearance.\n\nAndroid tv features are all cool.\n\n30 watt sound was better than anticipated. Sound bar wasn't necessary.\n\nBluetooth+IR remote is really good.\n\nHeadphone jack and Bluetooth functionality is nice.\n\nLot of picture settings to tweak with to get perfect picture quality that suits individual preference.\n\nGoogle assistant works great.\n\nCons-\nWhile VA panel is supposed to produce better blacks than ips, i didn't really notice good black levels.\n\nViewing from an angle wasn't as good(i guess, not sure).\n\nSome wierd light bleeding-like effects and some dark patches on edges of display especially noticable on YouTube app intro icon/animation. Only visible on frames with low brightness. (Most people wouldn't notice or care).\n\nNitpicks-\nBluetooth headphone connectivity is gimmicky. Audio only works on hdmi inputs and apps. Doesn't work on usb input, which is frustrating.(edit:- Disconnecting the AUX audio out cable solved the issue with bluetooth audio errors. but there is some audio latency for hdmi input sources while playing through bluetooth.)\n\nConnecting to Bluetooth headset while headphone jack is bieng used by sound bar is really hard. Options for switching audio to Bluetooth headset-only from audio jack is buried deep inside audio settings menu.(edit:- here also disconnecting audio AUX cable solved the issue)\n\nStarting time of tv is a bit high. Around 1 minute. Doesn't automatically play live tv/set-up box input after turning on the tv. You have to select input source each time you turn on the tv. Default input is Android home screen. old people wouldn't be able to watch on their own\n\nAndroid home screen interface is not always smooth.\n\n8k videos are not at all playable. Video just freezes. Tv cannot handle 8k resolution like some qhd smartphones do.\n\nDidn't notice any 4k upscaling of HD channels or SD channels.",
            "Great product at the price....\nOperating is simple and remote is Bluetooth connected (no IR Sensor) which I liked it very much. Google assistant voice commands make it easy for operating. Bluetooth earphones can be connected. Inbuilt chrome cast & Phone mirroring works like charm. Picture quality is great.\nSpeakers : it is more than enough for 30 feet Hall.\nDefinitely worth every rupee...\nReview based on one week usage.",
            "So got delivered just in 2 days. Awesome picture quality. 4k videos lagging for sometime. 2gb ram seems quite good. But design is super cool. Built quality is superior . In the end value for money . Go for it. WiFi connectivity is really fast. Lest wait for a week. I will update .",
            "After using 10 days , I am writing a review for this television.\n\nPros :\n1. Picture quality is best ,you can't get this quality at this price in any other brand.\n2. Performance is great. Tv responds quite fast, no lag so far.\n3. Sound is amazing, only 25% volume is enough to listen. True surround X feature works great.\n4. Features such as picture setting and sound setting works fine too.\n5. Prime, Netflix, hotstar n all apps are working fine. Just Jio Tv doesn't work( Need mouse for toggling)\n6. Android ver. Supports sideloads apps too.\n7. Casting smoothly works everytime.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Predefined Picture modes aren't good in picture settings.For eg. No mode for \"eye protect\"\n2.Fast motion in video gives you a headache , it's should've been more still. You can't read television running promoter.\n\n\nAfter usage of 2 months, voice command button stopped working on Remote and they said remote is not covered in warranty.",
            "I bought this TV for PS 4 Gaming which i thought. Would provide me a great gaming experiance as expected the TV picture quality is great and sound clarity is also great. Good TV for less Budget. Awesum from VU",
            "Excellent TV. I am writing this review to help others for the correct choice..It has awesome picture quality and sound. Internet connectivity is good. Non HD channels quality also good.",
            "Really after a long time I brought a Vu TV this is my first TV I never seen such a TV like this, picture quality amazing, sound, full screen display is very good advantage, connectivity super fast we should install google home for that, most probably I like this TV.. Wait for more ten days for my more reviews..",
            "After 2 weeks usage.\n1. Awesome picture quality.\n2. Sound is loud,but little bit clarity is missing(Ok).\n3. Built-in chromecast is working Fine\n4. Checked OTT Apps -prime,netflix,hotstar,Ahaa. All are working Fine.\n5.Best budget TV with best features in this price segment.\n6. Value for money",

Supports sideloads apps too.\n7. Casting smoothly works everytime.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Predefined Picture modes aren't good in picture settings.For eg. No mode for \"eye protect\"\n2.Fast motion in video gives you a headache , it's should've been more still. You can't read television running promoter.\n\n\nAfter usage of 2 months, voice command button stopped working on Remote and they said remote is not covered in warranty.",
            "I bought this TV for PS 4 Gaming which i thought. Would provide me a great gaming experiance as expected the TV picture quality is great and sound clarity is also great. Good TV for less Budget. Awesum from VU",
            "Excellent TV. I am writing this review to help others for the correct choice..It has awesome picture quality and sound. Internet connectivity is good. Non HD channels quality also good.",
            "Really after a long time I brought a Vu TV this is my first TV I never seen such a TV like this, picture quality amazing, sound, full screen display is very good advantage, connectivity super fast we should install google home for that, most probably I like this TV.. Wait for more ten days for my more reviews..",
            "After 2 weeks usage.\n1. Awesome picture quality.\n2. Sound is loud,but little bit clarity is missing(Ok).\n3. Built-in chromecast is working Fine\n4. Checked OTT Apps -prime,netflix,hotstar,Ahaa. All are working Fine.\n5.Best budget TV with best features in this price segment.\n6. Value for money",
            "I have been using SONY full HD for the past 4 years... Planned to go with Sony again but this product changed my mind to choose this because of the specs... It does what are the things that have told in the specs sheet.. Being a #Rahmaniac (#thalaivARR) fan sound quality is damn good.. Clear voices and great highs and lows.. Mind blowing one... What a great TV to upgrade...\nVU u r simply Awesome... Thanks for the great product..",
            "It looks truly premium with the silver bezel less design. The sound quality is really impressive. The interface is quite smooth but it does takes around 5-7 seconds to boot up once you switch on the tv. Android is neatly optimized and screen sharing works perfectly too. The best feature has to be Google Assistant and they have given a dedicated button for it on the remote. It easily detects and responds to our voice. The videos are rich, dynamic and clear. Although, the refresh rate is just 50 hz which is too low for a 4k panel but it serves the basic purpose if clarity is concerned. Its surely a value for money product. It was delivered and installed on the same day with no complaints. Perfect tv for its price!",
            "This is second tv for family. Flipkart delivery was on date and time..even installation n demo was same day within 2 hours at my place that i didn't expected. Tv is soo awesome and feels much premium.. viewing angles r superb on 175 degree..after that it little fade. but who watch tv on 180 degree?....HD & SD channels r running smoothly n SD channels view is also good. bazzels r soo thin..4k content runs superb without lag..sound is very very superb. 30w is very enough for tv. remote need alphanumeric physical buttons so that we can easily change channels by tv remote not by set up box remote. all ports r working and gives their output properly. Value for money.\nThanks.",
            "Not worth buying if you just heard good reviews about it from many people.\nIf you have a decent budget obviously go for good brands like Sony or Samsung or LG.\nOnly in the case u lack in budget but want the namesake extra features, then happily go for this one.\n\nThe quality is no where close to any other brands in terms or either screen display, sound or even frame rate. Everything just seems so lower in quality than the known brands.\n\nSo if u need a TV with good quality display, sound, etc don't think of this one.\nConsider only if u are bound by budget and can adjust with close to average performance or below!\n\nIn short, I'm not so happy with it! Wish I could just send it back.",
            "Writing this review after 2 months of usage. The Best option out there if you are looking for a budget Smart TV. I have Used MI TV also so I can compare both of them.\nIn each and every aspect, The Vu Premium TV 4k UltraHd is way ahead of the competition. It gives you the best Picture Quality, Easy Connectivity, Built in Google Assistant for Voice Commands, Easy to Operate Remote with a dedicated shortcut TV button for direct access to your cable or set top box channels (this shortcut not available in other brands) picture added for reference. The Sound Quality is great compared to other brands sound bar not required unless and until you're a loud music freak. I have connected Boat Avante 1200 Sound Bar beacuse I had to purchase it for my MI TV as it was low on sound output. But I rarely use the sound bar while watching TV.\nVu tv comes with a Wall Mount Stand and saves you Rs 500 which is not there with MI TV. Last thing to add, Low Power consumption and Overall Excellent Built Quality.\n\nHighly Recommended This Vu TV to those looking for a good smart TV. Go for it guys and this review is based on my personal usage experience and not influenced by any YouTube channel.",
            "First time bought this Vu brand TV and online though hadn't the first choice brand tv. But the specs sheet is really impressive and earlier models also having good reviews.\n\n1. Picture clarity is really good with HDR and crisp. 5/5\n2. Sound is a bit average. would be good if speakers are front-facing like cinema TV (voice has good clarity rather than music) 4/5\n3. Connectivity is well responsive. (except casting lags) 3.5/5\n4. And booting time is a bit laggy. (as expected in Android)\n5. In the segment of 4K tv's price is reasonable with 2GB RAM & 16GB ROM\n6. Extended warranty (3 yrs) is given by Vu tv itself with fee compare to Flipkart's complete protection (third party) it is owned and service by Vu TV.\n\nHope Android updates will be periodical update the TV and life span shud be at least 4 years. And Flipkart rep has been agreed to give complete protecting scheme even after purchasing TV but they refused later by saying as ''Miscommunicated'' Poor policy\n\nGood to extend the warranty to Vu tv itself. Complete satisfaction of Product",

I ordered this tv when sale is live. I was scared little bit because of some negative reviews about other models in Vu. TV delivered on saturday and installed today (sunday). After seeing the Dolby vision and HDR 10 videos really impressed. At this price you will never get this much luxorious features like dual Wifi, Bluetooth, Dolby vision, HDR10 4K, Optical out etc. Really worth the price and thanks to flipkart for making this wonderful purchase. Also tested with my PS4 hdr , working great and colors produced are awesome. Go for this TV if your budget is below 25k. I have exchanged my old 32inch tv for INR 3500.

            "Great TV. With this price, you can't ask for more. I am writing the review after using it for 3 months. Everything is good except one thing I found peculiar. The TV remote control is using the battery like hell. I have changed 3 sets of batteries in last 3 months. I found that during the booting, the remote control doesn't work sometimes. But when I put new batteries, it works perfectly. I can't find the reason. Otherwise everything is good.",
            "Pretty Good in terms of everything, be it playing 4k videos, upscaling low quality videos , built in Chromecast and prime, so no need to shell out more money on firestick or Chromecast. However, if you are totally into features and free aps , then you can go for mi 4k TV's, but you need to compromise on picture quality and premium feel of clean Android OS.\nI opted for vu TV's because they are dealing with TV's only for a decade, not in other products like mi, lg or samsung , so they can easily focus on quality and industry standards.",

            "Review based on last one week of usage.\n\n100% used for watching online content (prime,hotstar,zee plus, Jio TV and Youtube). Since not taken Netflix membership, not used that.\n\nAnything above 720P or above giving me very good results. Few web serious watched over prime was mind blowing(1080p). Surprisingly it is at par with my brother's LG oled TV ,which is almost 130000.(I watched web serious \"The last ship\" through both and made the comparison)\n\nTrust me if you have very good broadband wifi connection ,it will give you amazing results. Using your phone's hotspot also good but if you are watching more online content I recommend to get you a good net connection.\n\nOverall I think upto around Rs.50000 if you are looking for a purchase this will do the trick.\n\nSound is okay. No issues when you are watching in a 12 feet room. Good vocal clarity. When it compares to Mi TV it is far better. Pls don't expect bass from any led tv speakers,for that you must get additional sound woofer.\n\nRemote's four direction button placement is not good. I always accidentally touch other buttons and ended up with going to home screen. You have to keep your eye on remote always to avoid the mentioned problem. They should have given good separated navigation buttons. LG magical remot is way better.\n\nApps are installing very smoothly. No lag.\n\nNo heating issues so far.\n\nGoogle assistant is really brisk and giving replies in great time. Great.\n\nNot connected to cable tv .so no idea about tye results.\n\nFinal words.\nIt is a really good tv if you give good input. Try to watch your content in 1080 p and don't regret. Yesterday watched \"Gulabo Sitabo\" in ultra HD and amazed with the clarity.",

            "I watched almost all reviews of all TV's and i bought this VU 55\". Here are my findings.\n\n*Bigger the size better, but upscaling should be good bcoz not all videos you are going to watch are 4k or fullhd. Vu upscaling is good.\n\n*It's better to go for Android TV than Samsung or LG OS. Coz u get so much freedom in usage and more than enough apps. U don't need dish/cable/settopbox/firetvstick.\n\n*Its better if u don't install games in TV. Use TV as screen and connect a console or pc for gaming.\n\n*All Led TV's have less life span compared to plasma or lcd or crt TV. Can't do anything. Take extended warranty for peace of mind. Mostly led panel gets damaged due to lightning and surge.\n\n*I avoided all Chinese brands. Also Mi TV has poor clarity. OnePlus is way too expensive. TCL will get damaged soon. VU is Indian.\n\n*Vu is the best TV right now. Its been 1 month. I found no cons in this TV. Price is also way too less.\n\n*Place the TV straight to your eye. When u sit your eyes should be going right before the centre of TV. Universal law for Viewing distance= size of TV x 1.5\nEx: 55x1.5= around 6 feet.",
            "I'm using this TV One month very good performance n very good sound connectivity also fine quality superb Vu tv one of the best tv in 2021 in medium budget\nPicture 5/5*\nSound 5/5*\nConnectivity 4/5*\nQuality 5/5*\nInstalation 5/5*",
            "It's a good budget tv. Happy with product.",
            "First of all picture quality of the pannel is too good for this price point. It is a descent pannel with good color reproduction and very bright backlight. The speakers provide good quality output with a reasonable base frequecy. Surround sound effect brings the bass but you won't be able to hear the vocals clearly. You may feel uncomfortable with the sound settings for the first time. Background music will always be in a higher volume than the vocals even if we enable dialog clarity. Better find a sound setting that suits your room by trial and error method through all the settings. Or if you have a home theatre or soundbar then it will be good. But the TV is so loud that i don't even go above 30 as volume where 100 is the maximum. After a month and half of usage the issues which i faced or facing is whenever you keep idle the set top box for some time and when you turn on the set top box thr TV says weak/no signal. When you restart the TV that solves the problem or sometimes you may have to select the composit TV option from the input selection. There are minor glitches in youtube. Youtube randomly fails to sign in back when we go to home and press youtube button again. You can play almost all 4k yuotube videos without any lag but some videos shows some lag. Connectivity is very good. Connects seamlessly to blutooth headset in my case, wifi and lan. It also connects to 5GHz wifi which is a nice feature. Since the remote controller is a bluetooth based remote the batteries won't last as you see in normal TV's. Overall it is a great value for money. Dont expect too much from the play store. My overall rating is 4 on 5.\n\nAfter a year of usage, the tv pannel shows a group of dead pixels as dark spots randomly, but after a couple of weeks the spot disappears, again it re appears at a different location and disappears again after some weeks. Feels like burnt pixels.",
            "The best smart tv in the market at a very reasonable buy. If you're doubting the performance of the tv, I would like to tell you that I've used it for quite a long time now. It is a value for money. Must buy \ud83d\udc4d",
            "Clarity, sound and connectivity is awesome, Just go for it.\nDon't look for MI and other budget brands. VU would make you satisfied for the money you spend. 55 inch model looks very classy and rich. Google Voice assistant works very nice and sharing content thru WiFi is great. Connected internet thru LAN and there is no buffer from the day I bought the TV.\n\nIf you still have confusion, leave it off and go for VU.\nEither go with Premium or Ultra, both are same models.\nFrankly NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BOTH MODELS.",
            "The TV is real value for money. The interface is very good. I am using it as full internet TV and very happy with its performance. The 4K videos are awesome to watch. Loved it and recommend it for everyone seeking very good quality at reasonable price",
            "Excellent no need to buy sony, samsung, LG, & all other led. VU is the best price best quality equipped all features. It's Android based , Google Play Store available, you can install and update any app 16 GB memory 2 GB ram you can connect blue tooth headphones best picture quality and so many other features which are not available in high price LED I suggest everyone to buy this don't waste your money on costly LED Thanks VU",
            "Sd set top box channels are playing good more than average,I liked it very much best TV under 26k",
            "Had checked lot of big brands but some had speed problem, some had picture clarity some had missing technology ..this is one of the best buy .\nAlso after knowing the company is owned by Indians i had more trust on the same .\n100s of review on social media were true and I chose to avail additional guarantee along with the TV",
            "I bought the 43 inch model, great picture and sound quality, very loud. 4k videos look amazing. Connects seamlessly with my home wifi or even mobile hotspot. Plays online videos in 4k with ease. It connected my pen drive and 1 tb external hdd with ease as well. We bought the flexible wall mount from the installation guy for Rs 1.5k. Imo, they should have provided the flexible one in the box instead of the standard one, it's way way easier to access the ports and adjust the tv position as needed with the flexible mount.\n\nInstall the app called Thop Tv, it has every live tv and radio channel and every streaming service as well including our Indian ones, you can watch them all for free. You'll have to sideload the app. With this app, you won't even need dth connection.",
            "It\u2019s really awesome I compared this tv with other branded tv\u2019s after that I concluded this tv is \ud83d\udcaf worth able to purchase for this price it has more features and computate equally with branded tv\u2019s like Sony Samsung and all",
            "Colours are good and vivid. Refresh rate is not that good. You can observe some lag in the frame rate as compares to Sony/Samsung 50 inch 4K LEDs, but given the price difference, it is justifiable. Sound quality is not very good but also not very bad. Connectivity is good enough, ample ports, Bluetooth linking is seamless, Chromecast works perfect, WiFi connectivity is good. TV is easy to set up and use. Initial booting up (when TV has not been in use for multiple hours) is a little time consuming (30-40 seconds), but after that it boots up instantly. TV unit looks very modern, sleek and stylish, so that's a plus.\nAll in all, a terrific deal for <30k.\n(Note - Don't forget to avail extended warranty.)",
            "Wow it's awsome! After a deep & long online observation or comparison of 55 inches smart TVs I have got what I m looking for. I realized that I have done a good job by choosing this smart TV amongst all brands . however All apps are working smooth, hdpicture sound it's lazabab,connectivity is good.Thnx fkrt",
            "PICTURE : 4\nSOUND : 3.5\nCONNECTIVITY : 3.5\nVALUE FOR MONEY : 4\n\nPicture quality is great when considered with its price point. But not comparable with Sony as I have Sony as my primary TV in Hall. But its contrast is very good. You will get pure blacks.\n\nSOUND quality is average. But if you connect sound bars with dolby audio, you can feel the difference while watching movies. For an average user it's OK. But if you are a audiophile than you have to add sound bar to it.\n\nCONNECTIVITY : you will get all the connecting options in the TV. Wifi can be connected easily.\n\nOverall it's a value for the money you have spent on this TV considering the price you have paid. I paid 32k and really happy to get the TV for this price. My dad is very happy by seeing this TV in his bed room. You can go for it..",
            "The Product quality and the features are upto the standard expected.\nBeing a Indian company it has proven the desi product can also be good in lot of things..\nThe installation was done in the same day.\nBut the connectivity and ram management could have been better... otherwise a A+ product",
            "Super 1 day delivery and same day installation done by flipkart. Picture quality is good. Support dolby vision in Netflix. Sound is very crisp and dialogue is very clear. Don\u2019t expect bass though. Being vanilla android, makes it very smooth.",
            "Receive this product 13.05.2020 and installation team come after 3 days 16.05.2020. picture clarity is so good and sound, overall good product. I loved the first impression of this product. Connectivity is also good using casting. 4k is so nice.",
            "I am a tech enthusiast and was looking for something good under 70 thousand rupees. After going through many products and their reviews I realized many big brands have inferior quality products at high price due to brand value.\nBut these companies like VU,MI,TCL were providing good on-paper specifications for the price. I was having doubts before buying as I looked at negative reviews thoroughly. It was like a gamble I took. They had 10 day return or exchange policy so I took the gamble. And it was worth it. I am not saying those negative reviews are fake, I think they are just bad luck. But there is warranty and return policy so it's a benefit.\n\nOne con I find is, if your room has sunlight coming, there will be reflections on dark scenes so consider having curtains.\n\nSound is good not the best, I don't require sound bar, it is loud and clear enough for one room. Enabling \"Surround sound\" makes the sound feel like coming from all over the room even with just stereo TV speakers. I don't disable it now ;) .\nYou may require sound bar if you have a big hall. Bass is good, speech mode comes handy for dialogue clarity.\n\nI installed ethernet cable for better 4k streaming and it works without buffering. I have 50 mbps plan so considering that.\n\nHDR feel is 8/10. I mean what more do you expect?\nHDR clarity is 9.5/10( it is due to 4k resolution, nothing to do with HDR I think).\n\nViewing angles are excellent for one room, not for a big hall.\n\nI had a VU TV before but it accumulated dust patches inside panel, I had Extended warranty which helped me, I think I will have Extended warranty fir this one too.\n\nOver all a good deal. Wanted to give 4.6 stars but there is option so giving 5.",
            "Picture quality is ok based on the value of TV, more price more quality. I am satisfied with picture quality but not with sound. Sound settings need to change.\n\nHighly dis-satisfied with the installation person, despite very low review I don't understand why Flipkart is continuing with Jeeves.\n\nInstallation person claimed that TV can't be wall mounted and when I saw the invoice received from Flipkart, it is paying 1000 which is free for us but what is the use. I paid extra 600 to electrician to wall mount the TV, when outside person can wall mounted why expert can't do and what is the purpose of giving free installation.",
            "Giving review after end of 10 days return policy (means after usage of 10 days) : Vu T.v. is best on all aspects i.e. picture, sound, connectivity, awesome remote, voice assistant and at last value for money. It is easy to use, have up to date features in compare to other brand t.v. Enjoying Vu a lot......\nIt is my first smart t.v. and I want to say thanks to my friend Avinash for suggesting me such a nice product.",
            "Dear all\n\nI'm writing review after usage of one month's. 55 inch. Affordable price point compare to other brands. Vu made premium segment. Quality of picture is good. Need to improve sound quality. I suggest vu can provide soundbar along with TV set. Connectivity n bluetooth connection was good. Process, RAM & built-in memory more attractive at this price point. Overall good product. I recommended best price at best product.",
            "Using it for the past 1 month. I will surely recommend this 4k tv to everyone who is looking for a budget 4k tv with a lot of features which you will not find in lower end tv.\n\nPros: Picture and sound quality both are amazing\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d. Anyone would love it.\nOnly drawback is the connectivity and software. Sometime it takes long time to connect during casting and sometimes software creates a problem.\n\nBut that is minimal and every android tv can be considered as an android phone, so rarely you will find any drawback in this tv.\nI will surely recommend this tv to everyone and also it is an american based company so anyone who is not willing to buy MADE IN CHINA products can surely look ou for this budget android tv with a lot of specs",
            "Vu this time has given refined product so far.Was amazed to get delivery faster and installation even faster then expected.Quality of TV looks good.Only missing is led light which I think should appear in green when tv on...but appears only red when off.\nSound..amazing but not much difference in DB with modes of selection given.Different modes plays normal type music...Nedd to connect to Home Theatre.\nPicture quality you play HD content is perfect and can see deep shades..but in non Hd format eyes strains....Pixels break.Not many picture modes available with options.\nWe had Sony and in just 18Months developed line from entre of screen...not repairable...had to change screen at cost of 54000..its worst thatyoy pay three times on brand and get what I explained...hence for me in this range ..This TV is best for its quality and contents....\nOver all tv at this price is one of it's best in kind with Hotstar...Prime..and many more...\nIn this category.. this price is very less... company may soon increase price as I see pieces selling at very faster rate..\nSame like VU-OA ...and ither big screen tv ..this might be out of stock soon for sure....\nThis size tv ag this range is not avble on Tataclick...Croma..Amazon...etc...",

            "Impressive picture quality. It's time to write my first review on this product after few days of usage. It's not only remote but the interface of tv itself feel too lite. Sound quality is good but not great clarity. I feel at certain scenarios too much of mid frequency sound which makes us feel too loud. No word to talk about pic quality even at low bright, low backlight it still shows visible and clear picture with expectations of fine tuning. Wifi, works flawlessly. HDMI my Mac too a while to detect, not sure if it's a problem with tv or Mac. ARC, optical, audio out, composite, LAN yet to test, but fulfilling most of my requirement so far and happy with expectations. Will update with my findings after few more days of usage.",
            "Have used the TV for 1 week now, the display quality is gud but no where close to Sony or LG TV's\n\nOther things like sound quality, connectivity works well",
            "This is a review of vu premium tv after using it for a month. Overall, I am very impressed with the tv. 33k for a 55 inch uhd tv. This is the best deal you can get and full points for value for money. The pressure quality is great ranging from as channels to 4k content. The sound is also good but you need to tweak settings a bit to get the most out of it. The tv plays almost all kind of video files. The connectivity including screen mirroring and cast is flawless. The build quality is good an...\nREAD MORE",
            "Good product. Tv I liked the picture quality was very good . delivery is very much as worrest the delivery boy did not come near our house wells \ud83d\ude21 tied to the nearest town get them out of the job .thankyou",
            "My family is a hardcore Sony product fan, every electronic device on our house is of SONY brand. TV, Music System, DVD Player etc. However few months back just before the lockdown my Sony TV succumbed to death :( . I wanted to buy a new TV but this time I wanted to experiment and experience a new Brand, at an affordable price range. After doing lot of research i zero down to MI and VU. However, I never saw any MI tv in action in my day to day life. But VU tv i used to see installed in a lot of places i.e Conference halls, Institutes, Malls, etc. Thus i decided on purchasing VU tv. and boy I really loved my choice.\nIn my opinion, its the best bet in this price range, the TV is sleek and without any dust attracting pockets around it like other TV's. The picture quality is excellent. For me the sound of the TV is good. However for kids and young people who watch their TV on a very loud sound will not like the sound output of the device. But this problem can be curbed by external speakers.\nThe installation provided by Jeeves was super-fast, smooth, and without any hassles. They are very professional and swiftly executed their work with minimum invasion and no mess at all with the installation.\nVU customer care also provided me with an additional 4 months of warranty. which was like a cherry on the cake.\nMy suggestion would be to go for a biggest screen model if you have space.",
            "Awesome Purchase \ud83d\udc4d. Great top quality product from the house of VU. Looks great and sound also good. Main attraction is it's display, just awesome \ud83d\ude32. Only lacks installation. Flipkart assured installation service is Very bad, just worse ever experienced. They don't install my product since 7 days after delivery, last I'd install with local guy for paying extra Rs.200. Contacted customer care of Flipkart they raise a complain, but nothing happens, even I gave them a another installation address but they helpless. I'm plus member this is the first time I feel cheated. But except that TV is super, fabulous. One more thing, I noticed the chromecast facility is not up to the mark. Sometimes it failed to connect. I think the manufacturer solve this issue with software update. Love VU & Flipkart",
            "Simply WoW ..got what actually i thought of...it is my third purchase and it is getting better and better in terms of value for money and fast delivery system ..despite lockdown .,..",

            "Valuable purchase\nThis product is Awesome at this price , excellent picture quality, good sound, good finishing, overall very good product. Now have to see how hardware works, I purchased it with 2year extended warranty, company CEO is Indian, California based company , product made by china. I cut 1 star in rating because of china, but if you want cheaper product you have to ignore this.",
            "After one month of usage, I am pretty satisfied with this product. Don't try to compare this product with the top branded oled amoleds. With this price rage this tv performs well and highly recommended if any one looking for budget tv with low price range.\nSound and picture quality is gold at this price range.",
            "Amazing buy.. Extremely happy with the timely delivery and demo of the TV.. Amazing picture quality.. Connectivity is also very good unlike highlighted by many(The TV turns on in flat 15 20 seconds).. Sound quality is a bit underwhelming due to the bottom facing speakers... Overall a very good buy and happy with the TV... This review is post usage of 3 4 months....",
            "I bought VU 50\" TV form Flipkart at the price 29,999/-\nPicture Quality is Pretty Good 5/5\nSound Quality good 4/5\nBuild Quality of TV ok 4/5\nPerformance of the tv 5/5\nOver all i given rating 4/5",
            "Definitely a great product. However it needs a few tweaks here and there, for example You need to turn off Truvolume HD and Truesurround X while playing Dolby encoded or normal audios, otherwise the vocal clarity would be pathetic. While playing the DTS sounds these should be turned on. Also selecting Theatre sound preset gives a better sound than all other modes. Dolby Vision looks good on the panel but HDR isn't that great. Netflix supports Dolby vision content on this tv and you would the logo flash up whenever a supported content is streamed. At this price it is certainly value for money and a good tv too. Nothing much to complain about.",

            "Very fast delivery from Flipkart and installation done within no time.\nNo doubt TV has a great sound quality and picture quality. But 50 inch TV having 60 hz refresh rate is really bad, especially while watching cricket. You can hardly see the pictures clear, all you see is blurry image in fast motion. Any picture with speed cannot be viewed clearly. I dnt suggest people to buy this TV especially who like to watch sports and thriller movies. you cannot enjoy!!! Motorola TV's are really good i Feel. The blacks are not perfect, dark scenes and black shades are look worst. Lot of blue tint. Doesn't give a pleasing effect to ur eyes.\nEg: the colors of hair, blacks, dark scenes have dark blue and purple tint. So the black don't appear black. i hope you understand!\n\nMy review: dont buy",
            "Well I am not a professional. So after more than a month use, I will try to point down some points what I liked and what I disliked in this tele\n\nPro's :\n1. Cost wise very economical, if you want to purchase same with LG or Samsung, it will cost just double.\n2. TV looks good and stylish with nothing much eye popping.\n3. Pen Drive slot works perfectly.\n4. With 2GB RAM it works perfectly, it gives you ease to download more apps on playstore.\n5. Colors are vibrant and soothes to eye.\n6. I have checked Netflix, it works fine. I guess rest also will work same.\n\nCon's :\n1. I have bought TV for my parents, they will only watch SD channels trough Tata Sky. So it's bit odd, the picture clarity is not perfect. I have bought the TV thinking it will give quality picture. I have checked HD channels, it gives clearer picture than SD. If you connect through OTT platform or Youtube, the picture is good.\n2. The sound quality is not so good. When we play any serial or film, the music is loud but vocals many times are not understood.\n\nThis two points are very important and it does not stand well in this two aspects. So if I had the option earlier and known this cons I will surely go for standard TV's since it was for my parents. But I thought why not give them 4k and I somewhat regret but \"FINE\"...",
