            "Good Product.\nThe TV is very good for the price range, i have used oneplus QLED Q1 and would like to compare with it.\n\n1) Picture Quality:\nQuality is excellent for an non -qled TV, the black levels are not so deep compared to Oneplus TV.. but other colours look vibrant and and natural. Screen is bright enough, 4K HDRs look stunning, 1080p is also looks great, it plays 4k HDR and 2160p at 60 FPS is YouTube. SD channels understandably looks dull, Dolby vision is supported and looks even great, but as black levels are bit low dark scenes look washed out a bit, but still it looks great if watching from a distance, u need to fine tune a bit in the picture settings to get some desired colours, one annyoing thing with this TV is in most picture settings motion enhancement is kept On. so if u are watching movies means u will feel soap opera effect and everything moves smooth that u will not enjoy movie, so while watching movies make sure u turn smooth motion to OFF.\nOverall i rate it 5 out of 5 as it is nonqled tv\nEdited on 2-2-21\n\n2) Sound Quality\nIf u think 100 watts is enough and sounds great, get ready to get disappointed, I don't know if its problem with my Tv or System is like that, the sound doesn't sound good, my onelpus at 50w sounded excellent, but this TV dont know if its problem with my TV, but its sounds below average, no clarity and audio settings are also so much confusing with so many On and Offs, may be need to fine tune that, and also i feel some sounds are missing it sound like it is not playing all vocals, feeling something is missing, will check and comeback later and give sound feedback.\nTill then Overall Rating is 3 out of 5\nEdit: it's a problem with software got desirable result after fine tuning and changing settings\n\n3) TV Menu and Remote\nTV is typical android TV Menu and u can download all popular apps and games,\nRemote is fine but its plastic and looks of cheap quality, but its ok as it as all basic buttons and shortcut keys to many popular apps, and also shortcut to input selection.\none thing is whenever power on TV it goes to Android Menu, it doesn't go to HDMI, i haven't found any setting which makes HDMI as default screen, can be bother some for old people.\nNot giving overall Rating as it depends on individual preferences\n\n4) Screen Mirroring\nscreen mirroring is absolutely great and everything works, i mirrored YouTube videos and games from pocox3 to TV and it plays almost lag free, games also look great even if its casted from mobile,\nRating 4.5 out of 5\n\n5) Connectivity\nHas all major connectivity at side and if u are wall mounting consider putting USB extender cable and one extra HDMI cable and leave the cable, so u can connect HDMI devices and External HDD easily whenever needed.\nIt connects to my Pocox3 hotspot and connection is very stable and plays videos at 1080p without buffering,\n\none more thing many say its rebranded of Hisense Tornando TV, i cant comment on that as I don't have that TV, Physical photo wise and specification wise both looks similar in every aspect.\n\nWill add few more feedback later after using for more days.\n\nAt present i am giving it 5 out of 5.\ni will probably wait for one update so that sound issue can be resolved, really u wont believe is it a sound of 100 wats speaker,",
            "Best tv in this price segment. With this feature s, you will get this tv on half the price of samsung, lg or sony. Excellent picture. Clear sound. And 3 years warranty. Delivery was on time. Installation guy was very humble and good. Free installation. Gave his number, if any issue comes. Thanks flipcart. Thanks VU. Cinema tv is best.",
            "Its a really good TV with Amazing picture clarity, Standby mode to switch on tv faster if on standby and decent sound quality.\n\nSound is too loud and very good as well but its not the best since i am used to of hearing through Bose, Bose speakers are much much better in quality, but then in price too.\n\nIt should have been priced 5k less, but never the less, there isn't any 65 inch TV in this range with these features and quality, so had to opt it and i am very much satisfied with it.\n\nThis TV is hisense procured with maybe some optimization done from VUs end. I could make this out that this is hisense procured since the name of motherboard is also hisense when i checked with CPU app. They dint even bother to change it... :P.\n\n3 Years warranty is great to have.\n\nWhile purchasing if you still do not have any other TV with lesser price with these features, then go for it, you won't regret it.",
            "I have been using the TV for around 1 week now and my first impressions are really good. Before buying this, I already had used a 40\" VU TV along with a 48\" Samsung, so I had no qualms about its picture quality and was confident about buying. And this had not let me down. Amazing picture quality for the price. You really feel like owning a personal theatre. I chose this model over the cheaper 65\" model because of JBL speakers. Well the speakers are not really out of the world but they do the job for a small drawing room - decent clear sound, only thing missing is good bass, for which I plan to buy a bass booster soon.\nMy only issue is with settings of picture, while the quality is amazing but the default settings keep coming back, not sure why it cant save the settings. The default settings have a backlight option set at 100 which is harmful for the eyes and in one week almost everyone in my house is having pain in their eyes, before I figured out the issue. Even automatic settings dont help, you have to manually reduce the backlight setting to 40-50 level for all presets. Thats the only issue, I hope it saves the preset settings for future. Will confirm the same in my next edit of review after one more week.",
            "Picture Quality is not upto the mark whereas in TCL having almost same prices having far better picture Quality.Sound is cool but not good as 100W speakers.i purchased it in a hope that it is Indian Brand to support Make in Bharat.",
            "Thanks to Flipcart. I ordered my TV on 26 th january. promptly as suggested i received it within two days in good condition. installation was also in time and fully saties fied for their immediate response. Good as per my observance for the first one week.",
            "Picture clarity is excellent and sound is like home theater. 4k and 8k channel are looking like real picture. In 65 inch worth for money",
            "VU cinema series TV..best tv ...nyc sound..4k vdo picture quality super...worth in this price...luv to bought this...very much satisfied and happy wth this product...also flipcart service is very promt and professional....smooth installation by professional technician...my Vikas...very soft spoken and decent guy...",
            "This is the only review you will need.\nThis model is the updated version of 2020\u2019s VU Cinema TVs with more storage, ram and a better processor. The 103W soundbar is a highlight. I can 100% recommend anyone to go for this TV blindly, there is no compromise made. Be sure to checkout the tips section for best experience.\n\nPICTURE:\nThe panel offers rich vibrant colors and excellent contrast. The color gamut coverage is great. Brightness level is literally a benchmark. Even the black levels are super-deep for an LED. It even supports HDR 10 and Dolby Vision content which many modern releases are available in. No defects like light bleeding were observed. The overall picture quality is directly comparable to top end TVs\n\n4K on youtube etc. looks brilliant . I am still to play true 4k content on this but thats not needed to see how good the display is. Upscaling of content is excellent too. 1080p content looks flawless, virtually indistinguishable from a 4k print at first glance. Even SDR content is displayed well. I recommend turning off clear motion feature for SDR content as these features tend to impact image quality of SDR content on all TVs.\n\nSOUND:\nThe sound bar is amazing and produces all frequencies well, especially the bass. The punchy yet balanced bass makes sound effects and background score all the more impactful. There are many expensive top end TVs, especially Sony TVs that compromise on sound quality. It is such and important aspect of viewing that gets overlooked by premium brands so that customers have to buy separate speakers/soundbars. VU has placed the customer first and packed an excellent sound system that will be enough no matter how big a hall you place this tv in. Just a volume level of 20 is enough to rock my house. It is perfect for parties as every beat and note is felt from these speakers. The tv even has an audio only mode that turns off the display for such situations.\n\nINPUT:\n\nIts got all the necessary ports and also reads my hard drive well. I am yet to check if there is input lag for gaming.\n\nTIPS for best experience:-\n1) Picture:\n> Use backlight level of 50-70. This panel is so bright, using backlight above 70 is just pointless. Even 50 is practically enough unless there is too much lighting in the room.\n> Turn off active contrast. Its a gimmicky feature all Tv brands are pushing nowadays but we are better off without using it. Using it artificially enhances the contrast between distinct colors which can cause some details to get blown out around bright areas of a picture. It also makes shadow regions in images look unnatural. I recommend not using this feature on any brand and instead increase the contrast setting to suit your eye.\n> I prefer natural or standard preset but there are enough options to suit your preference. Even dolby vision mode has options. Since the panel already produces rich colors, i would keep color setting at 50-55.\n\n2) Sound:\n> Turn on tru bass (this makes the bass punchy and even adds warmth to sounds like voices).\n> Turn on dialogue clarity.\n> Turn off surround sound.",

            "Let's make VU TV a premium brand like sony, lg, samsung, mi.. . OMG.. After using two days i am writing this.. A value for money TV.. Picture is awesome.. 5 star.. Its a sound gaint.. Gave it 105 star..ou of 100 star. True dolby atmos sound & vision.. Colours are real.. Truely a CINEMA experience.. Just go for it with out a doubt.. One thing is clear that VU tv is none other than a Hisense Tv.. This a one product of HISENSE TV with a new name.. So clear ur doubt.. If u want 3 year warranty on a tv then go for it.. Other than Hisense tornado is the option with 1 year warranty.. Fast delivery by FLIPKAT.. but one thing i want to share with FLIPKART that, Technician who install the tv are likely to be more professional. \"Javes\"(installation company) is not sent professional technicians, they work with local technicians.. And very last if u want to convert your dining or living room to a cinema hall then surely go for it.. The VU tv is not a less then any other big brand tv.",
            "Excellent product good and safe delivery and instalation person good coming to tv very big screen this is not tv\nTheatre value for money overall excellent",

            "VU cinema TV. After this marvelous purchase, me, my family dnt wanted to go to theatre and waste money.\nSound: Aah, the soundbar giving me the ultimate sound effect thanks to \"dts- surround\" system which gives you clyster clear sound(without woofing) makes you feel sound every corner with 3d auro.\nIt's better to have a closed room then the sound will be the same I mentioned. Otherwise it will be like normal tv sound ( better than the rest)\nFor your information, I have sony ht300 connected with tv.\n\nPicture: What to say..... Dolby picture gives ultimate picture quality like none another tv in this segment with 500hz quality.\n\nAll around purchase experience: A BETTER CHOICE TO BUY A BIG SCREEN WITH GOOD SOUND.\nCLOSE YOUR EYES AND GO WITH THIS\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude0a",
            "Just buy! I would urge you to not waste your time in comparing the TV in terms of cost and quality with other brands. Undoubtedly the best configuration in this cost. I bought this a month back and it looks just perfect. Like anybody else I spent hours and hours to be sure. I only don\u2019t have any feedback on the service provided by Vu as it is only a month.\nBest Brightness, Best Sound system, Good refresh rate, Good inbuilt routers(in layman language).",
            "Review after usage of one month. Super TV. Very good picture quality. If your are fond of watching movie in theatres, you can watch movie in this TV in cinema picture and theatre sound mode, u will get kind of theatre feeling. One con is that the normal SD channels doesn\u2019t look that great. Sound is very good, only buy this tv if you don\u2019t have sound bar, else you will be wasting money in again buying attached JBL speakers.\n\nFinally I want it say it\u2019s a good tv and 3 year warranty is just good.",
            "The output quality is guaranteed, the back panel such Rock solid , a fantastic choice with this price segment. Sound is good compared to other leading brands. Feeling like watching at theatre.",
            "Certainly a best deal and to buy this cinema scope type TV is worth with the three year warranty coverage. Chromecast not functioning well with streaming videos of YouTube etc., had to be fixed and updated. Planning to buy another TV of the same brand.",

            "Reviewing after 1 month of usage. I was very hesitant while getting this brand. I have previously used a samsung 40inch non-smart tv.\nPICTURE : Settings available to customise as required, brightness and color have capabilities. Do try multiple settings and use the preferred one.\nSOUND : tvs with good sound are less now a days. Speakers are capable of giving a lot of bass and also there are handy settings for turning them on or off. As mentioned in one of the comment. Theatre mode works good. If not a bass lover, disable to 0 bass as at times bass will affect voice a bit.\nCONNECTIVITY : not seen problem at all\nCurrently on Android 9\n\nVery less options on 65 inch variant, definitely a good buy on this price range.",
            "The sound quality for a 100w soundbar is not upto the mark, Picture quality is good and refresh rate is better than other tv. Overall the performance of the tv is good just a little disappointed by the sound quality",

            "It was best decision I made, delivered on time, installation was quick & smooth. Writing this review after 5 weeks of usage, picture quality excellent with exceptional viewing angle, true colour display. Sound is very good, I never increased beyond 20 % of max valume for regular Chanel, higher valume in music channel does give good bass , it's more than sufficient , but can't expect performance of high end home theater experience. Overall more than happy with performance.",
            "after using 2 months, i would like share the review of this product, 3 years warranty is amazing, 100 watt sound is not so good, up to 10 points of volume is good, after 10 points volume not increasing much more, moderate increase, dialague clarity is not as much as we expected, background sounds dominated the dialogues , connectivity was good, picture quality is awesome",
            "Good picture quality with impressive sound. Go for it with eyes closed. My first order had black patches in the edges so got it replaced within 10 days. Second tv has been good so far",

The JBL sound bar is very decent and doing it's job. Overall, satisfied with the whole performance of the TV in this price range\ud83d\ude00.",
