            "Background: I had a Leeco 55 inch 4K television which stopped working due to display fault within 6 months of purchase. Since Leeco went out of India, i was not able to get the warranty. Heartbroken, i waited for 1 year before i bought this TV. i was inclined to get Samsung/LG this time but price of 55 inch 4K TV from those companies was still out of reach. I planned to get VU, but then the problem started, In my budget i saw this TV as well as similar model (LTDN55XT780XWAU3D) which has almost same features. That model is older version and will be phased out soon. VU website showcases this TV and not the other model. So i decided to purchase this. Also the deciding factor was that this TV runs Android and not the old Opera OS of the previous model.\n\nSetup and Installation: It was quick and was done much earlier than stated. No issues in that\n\nHardware: The TV panel Looks good, but its much thicker than my 2 year old (dead) Leeco TV which was much more sleek looking. The stands are okay and the wall mount came free, although i used my existing wall mount.\nThe remote is cheap, and i mean really cheap. The older model had better remote than this.\n\nSoftware: Although this being an android TV, the OS has not been well thought out and faced multiple issues while navigating the interface. Just to give you an example, you cannot switch source (HDMI1 HDMI2 etc) while watching any video or using any apps (such as netflix). Why on earth its not possible is beyond me! you should be able to switch source from anywhere to anywhere. To switch source you have to come back to the home screen...navigate to the switch source picture and then click it (although there is a big button for switching source in the remote itself). Second example, you cannot change picture or audio settings while you are on the android interface. I am yet to comprehend why its so. To change the picture settings (contrast brightness etc.) you need to switch to HDMI 1 or HDMI 2 and do it and then return to android interface. till now i have not found how to do it. the \"menu button\" does not do anything in these scenarios (which is used to invoke settings dialogue in HDMI sources)\nThird, i have seen multiple hangs in my 1 week of usage in Netflix and Youtube and there are times the remote will not do anything however hard i might try. Fourth, compared to my old 55 inch 4k TV, the voutube videos and the netflix videos are not that crist, even 1080 feels like 720p. Since i can compare i notice these, regular users will not notice this issue.\n\nSaying that, my family uses this interface and for them its okay and they hardly notices these since all they watch is youtube and netflix from the smart apps. They do not complain.\n\nMy Setup: I have my PC hooked up with this TV via HDMI and my Sony HOme Theater via HDMI (ARC) as well.\n\nPicture Quality: When i use it to display my PC content the picture quality is good. I have no complains. The Black levels are pretty okay for a cheap 55inch TV and there is no major Light bleeding from the edge. But please remember this is not an OLED panel, so do not expect pure Black. In this regard it is better than my old Leeco 55 inch TV.\n4K content looks superb and you can adjust multiple parameters to suit your needs. Also note that this comes with HDR 10 and it works in Games (Far cry 5, Mass Effect Andromeda etc). I keep the TV at brightness and Backlight set at 50 and contrast at 80 and sharpness at 100.\nOverall, picture quality wise (in PC - HDMI mode) is very satisfactory and it serves my purpose right. Those who solely needs the smart features and fully dependant on it, i would suggest go for the Official android version TV from this company (although priced higher). For light to moderate usage of smart features and actual picture quality wise this TV is Satisfactory.",
            "Ordered 55 4k on 12th July for watching world cup final. Got the demo and installation done on 14th July. So thumbs up to Flipkart for quick service!\n\nTV is easy to use and quite intuitive, though demo by Jeeves could have been a little more detailed to understand more TV features.\n\nNetflix and Youtube work seamlessly on this. Liked the e-share app which lets you 'talk' to your TV - you can display pictures, cast your phone, transfer data etc. through the app. Overall a great buy at such an affordable price.",
            "Got it delivered last week. I got it it for 36999, at this price this the best product. Picture quality is very good, sound is also good. They should have given bluetooth, but not available. Everything is working fine, just a lil bit disappointed with connectivity of Wi-Fi. I was told by the installation guy that this tv supports 4k only via pendrive or external hard disk. I talked to customer service, they also told me the same. Really disappointing that the team of customer support is like this. Actually, I want to tell each nd every user of this tv, that u can add it account and access it in YouTube, after updating it. It can be updated by mirroring the tv to mobile. Just update it, interface will upgrade, u will be able to login YouTube, and in resolution option 4k will open. Customer support team didn't believe me first, on my 2nd call another executive heard and believed me and asked me the process to do so. This long conversation went on because YouTube hot key was not working after updation. And it will not work, that is not a issue, believe me guys, update YouTube, you will appreciate this LED more, as 4k option aur be there. Everything else is fine till now, and hope so would go fine in future. VU, u need to improve ur team, so that they can easily help out these kind of hidden features. Best package, can go for it, no second thought.",
            "I have purchased VU 55\" 4K TV on Rs.31979. I can say in this price you can not buy such a 4K smart TV. Picture quality is very good & I have connected to mobile via WiFi, Youtube is working good. Hotstar App is not working. Overall I would suggest to buy the VU TV. I appreciate Flipkart team for the fast delivery of product within 3 days.",
            "Hot star not open,esharing not open.facebook scroll not working only first page showing.esharing wifi need.mobile saved data like photos and documents only u have share.not for chrome cast futures.its not full android TV.only given few apps.first picture hot star maximum 1hr loading not open.above all issues I faced my vu 55inch led TV.",
            "good TV for the price as it bundles all required fetures with the big screen size. have been using it for 10 days till now no issue.\n\nthe installation was good but demo was poor. probably the installation guy from Jeeves was less smart compared to the TV.\n\nyou may take the extended warranty from Flipkart as it's cheaper compared to market rates. however I have not taken it.",
            "Using this TV from 10 days. It's the cheapest 55 inch 4k TV. For me the picture quality is tooo bright and decreasing the brightness don't really work well. So i prefer muted colors of Soft setting. Its Android 7.0 but there is no playstore. YouTube plays max 1080p resolution. But trust me as i tested many many files that are 4k and both in full hd. Both videos plays exactly same. So 4K upscaling is really good and 4k and 1080p video look almost same unless you are hell bent to find a difference. SD channels look OK and not odd. Full HD DISHTV looks good. But my only concern is tooo bright skin tones and we can't adjust colors when youtube is playing. Sound is just ok. Sometimes 50%sound looks tooo lame in regular size room. For the Price Sony Lg cost over 1 lakh minimum and at this price i got more then what i paid for.",
            "I bought this TV 3 months back. Since then picture quality is a big issue and I am following up with VU support to resolve the same.\nFlipkart has washed off their hands by saying that I need to follow up with VU support as they can return only within 10 days.\n\nVU support officially responded that this TV is 4k and full HD picture quality will be bad and recommend me to watch only 4k content.\n\nThis is a big let down from brand like VU and Flipkart who is a sole promoter of this brand.\nPathetic...\nREAD MORE",
            "Bought this Tv @ 37k on Big Billion Sale, Overall Tv was Good, as it's based on Android we can install any APK we want, but main drawback is it doesn't have a play store (its installed but hidden from main menu, but can be launched from another launchers).\n\nPicture Quality is Good It rendered 4k videos also smoothly.\n\nSound quality is Okay\n\nConnectivity: LAN,Wifi and hotspot is available but it doesn't have Bluetooth\n\nScreenMirroring, playing remote files is working great with EShare app, also Try BubbleUpNp for better experience.\n\n\nOverall I would suggest to buy this TV in this budget",
            "1) Getting reddish colour shade over some indoor scenes.\n2) No 4k video playback support in youtube app. You can get 4K support by updating the app to latest version through google play but with this the videos on home page and hot key on remote wont work.\n3) Hotstar will be crashed when you install from given store. You need to go to play store through browser, update the app then it will work.

            "I got this TV during the big billion days sale for 37 grand and at this price point, I must say it is a solid choice even when compared to brands like Samsung and Lg which use the same Led technology and not the Oled ones.\nColour reproduction is good but since this is an led so blacks are not perfect.\nI live in a far-off town so delivery took time but I was satisfied with the overall delivery and installation experience.\nComing to the TV itself.\nIt has a behemoth panel and highly suitable for even a large room size since I myself sit and watch it at 15 feet distance and it feels perfect.\nThe ports on the rear bottom are accessible even after wall mounting but the ones on the side are inaccessible unless you have really thin hands.\nI would advice getting a USB m/f connecting wire which you can connect to the Tv while mounting and use it for connecting/disconnecting the Pen drive.\nPROS:\nHuge panel at this price and the quality is good too\nThe sound is ok for normal Tv viewing and is enhanced better when viewing an HD channel since most of them have Dolby Audio\nConnectivity ports are plenty. I have an Xbox one s, Dth and a soundbar connected to the 3 HDMI ports.\n4k content looks great\nThere is no Lag what so ever in the smart interface.\nCONS:\nNot really a smart Tv, limited to Youtube and hotstar.\nYou must download Vlc player from the TV store as the generic player does not support a lot of video formats including large 4k files.\nThere is no option to choose the display properties like colour brightness etc in the default smart home or during the Pen drive playback.\nEshare is ok but windows Pc has some issues connecting to eshare.\nAll that said I would highly recommend this Tv for anyone looking for a budget tv with decent features and a really large screen.\nIf you want all the smart features, I recommend you go for a chrome cast or a fire stick( it supports 4k now) or a console like I do.\nYou can also connect it to a soundbar if you want to further enhance the viewing experience but even without it, the speakers would suffice.\nP.S. I strongly suggest using a wired LAN connection as it tends to disconnect from the Wi-fi if the signal is not strong.\n\nHAPPY VIUING.",
            "I got my 55 inches tv delivered on Sunday yesterday 11th nov\nM waiting for installation guy\nBut I m very excited I will post review soon about tv \ud83d\udc4d\nInstallation executive is excellent n he guide us so well & also finally my tv \ud83d\udcfa 55inches VU looking so awesome I think it\u2019s a best purchase if u wanna buy big screen at reasonable price\nValue for money\nI used YouTube hotstar\nI downloaded prime videos n wife connectivity is excellent video quality 5/5 it\u2019s actually beyond expectations becoz it\u2019s actually 4K more than HD\nGo for it guys superb\nThank you Flipkart",
            "This tv is a completely package as comparing to mi tv this tv has many option like you can easily mirroring you iPhones and android to this tv as is also have mi tv in that i face problem connection iPhones to tv but android phone connect and comes to the picture quality this VU tv has amazing quality and you can control the brightness colour and contrast as well and the only main drawback i found is tv is connectivity port some ports are below the screen that is good but like HDMI usb line out are place behind the tv so that us make me difficult to connect to those ports due to wall mount of tv rather then this is very good TV and upscaling is very good",
            "Before buying it I was worried. But genuinely the product is the best product I have bought it has a perfect picture quality perfect sound best finishing in style. I personally request to those people who want to buy you can buy it without any hesitation. fulfill your all requirement of entertainment.",
            "Dont buy this tv its use less just mentioned as smart tv by namesake. No blue tooth . No optical audio. No 5ghtz wifi i.e 802.11ac , doesnt support any other apps . Very slow ui . Remote is pathetic. And its not even looking like 4k quality its like 720P screen . Waste dont buy. VU makes good tvs but this is the worst one . Buy other models.",
            "Picture Quality Is Good But This Tv Is Not A Smart Tv Very Limited Apps No Play Store And U Can't Mirror Your Android Phone That is None of the Vu led Tv has Miracast which most of other smart led tv has so this tv is for watching content only there is no such thing as smart in this tv",
            "Absolute bang for the buck, at this price the deal was too good to pass on at 38k.\n\nI have paired this with an Apple TV 4K, connected with an HDMI as I prefer its interface over Android.\nWith JBL sound-bar connected through HDMI ARC, making it surreal experience through great sound and picture.\n\nWas using a VU 49\u201d Smart Tv since last 3 years, so its a small upgrade for me, as I need this only for a year, and then I\u2019m saving up to buy the gigantic 85\u201d VU sometime next year which would cover an entire wall at that size. :D",
            "I got this tv in big billion day offer at 37k...Ultimate led smart tv...quick delivery from flipkart... Crystal clear display... Better sound quality... Screen mirroring options awesome thing... Overall extraordinary package at this price range... I honorly recommend this led product... Thank you flipkart...\ud83d\udc95",
            "well everything looks good initially. but I am not able to connect my jbl soundbar via arc to it. I tried to complain several times to vu, but their support system is pathetic. you log on complaint daily and they will close it unilaterally with the message that happy to assist you where nobody calls up.. extremely bad support system. don't deserve to be in corporate world and no fun if one want to connect good music system to it",

            "For you to be able to watch any 4K video, the TV should have a good Aspect Ratio, in all TVs like Vu, OnePlus, Moto n Nokia it's only 60 htz, which is terrible. It should be 120 or more. It is 120 or more in Samsung, LG n Sony. If not the video will keep on pausing. For watching Full HD though all these Tvs are good but for 4K only some TVs are.",

            "It is a great value for money TV. Having said that if budget is not a constraint going for Samsung QLED or Sony OLED might give you better display particularly in bright environment. Overall display is very good for the TV and if you can ensure not too much lighting behind your seating, it will be a great viewing experience.\nI read reviews about low sound level, but I home setting I found the sound more than adequate.\nIn terms of connectivity I did find some minor issues but nothing major. I will recommend using a steaming device along to further improve your experience.\nOverall, for about 34K, this TV gives you 4K resolution 55' display of good quality, which is an awesome deal for some good viewing at home.",

Luckily i could compare both as my 2 friends had each.\nGot the product during the sale period , together with 2 year additional protection got it for 36k.\nAt this price range we cannot complain much.\nAt first , the unit i got a slight panel dis-colour at the edge , but i got the item replaced within 10days. Customer support with Flipkart is really nice\n\n\nPros\nEconomical\nDoes its job quite well\n\nCons\nSound , 16w is ok , not good enough if u are a movie enthusiast .\nFor the same reason as above , i got a JBL 2.1 soundbar to counter the issue, then only i realized Iconium Model doesn't have a optical cable sound slot , only Aux and HDMI\nWhen i connect with HDMI ARC , the TV often confuses itself to give the sound output , couple of repeated ON/OFF only solves the problem. Aux works fine\n\nMy opinion for anyone who plans to buy a soundbar also, go with VU Pixelight model , it has Optical slot for sound.",

The product was faulty - I trusted Flipkart to give me a replacement for the same as it's a gift. I tried replacement through the site itself - the system returned an error.

            "Vu Iconium 55 inch Smart TV is value for money, but at some tradeoffs.\nThe smart interface of Vu is not upto the mark. I would suggest android certified TV\u2019s, as they will be having stock android experience on TV.\nNetflix/YouTube/ Hotstar on the store in tv are very old versions and can\u2019t get full experience out of it.\nPicture quality is wonderful, sometimes you would feel that the screen is over saturated. Other than that no issues on the panel.\nOverall it\u2019s value for money. I paid 37k for 55\u201d model. For that price, it is a wonderful option",
            "Excellent buy. Prompt delivery by Flipkart and same day installation/ demo by Jeeves. For the price, it\u2019s definitely a terrific bargain. Picture quality and smart features are second to none. Only wish Amazon prime is available on a single button on the remote.",

My panasonic 58 inch HD led non smart tv is far far better than this VU 55 inch UHD smart tv specially in terms of picture quality. Picture quality or panel of VU is not even 50% of my panasonic tv. Smart interface is also not gud and not even user friendly. Yes it's sound is far better than my panasonic tv but that is not a big issue as we buy a tv ...\nREAD MORE",
            "I was using Vu 40in for 3 years before upgrading to this TV. The experience has been largely disappointing. If you connect an external speaker, the sound comes from both TV and speaker. The TV remote can only control the TV speaker and not TV output. The solution suggested was to mute TV and use speaker output. Unless the speaker has a remote you need to keep manually adjust volume (or make speaker redundant)\nOn connectivity, the hotstar doesn't work by default, so you need to call Vu tech team (who respond after 2-3 weeks) who will give an update via pen drive. But this update made Netflix non functional. So again had to call tech team (who can't after a month) and now neither Netflix or Hotstar works\n\nyou can use it as a non smart TV maybe",

M/s Flipkart book DKT No. 576901899 for Shimla, Himachal Pradesh. I received call from Gati courier, Shimla and informed proper address and location of my home address to the concerned person, who was calling from Gati Courier. I was surprised, when I saw the status of my LED TV on Gati website that \u201cUndelivered due to MISMATCH IN ADDRESS & PINCODE\u201d. My address/ location was just 5 kmts from the Gati Courier office at Shimla. I write a complaint at the same time, when saw the status, but no response received. After two days, I received a call from Gati courier Shimla that they deliver LED TV only on National Highway. If you would like to collect the same, confirm the NH location otherwise we will return the same. For not receiving the LED TV 55 inch, I was very upset in these three and four days. I have to pay extra payment for carrying the same from National Highway to my home location. Gati Courier service is worst. It is suggested, if the courier company is not able to deliver the material at the given location don\u2019t give the material, so that the end customer never suffer.",

            "This review has been written 2 weeks after purchase. The installation was trouble free and the technician was accommodating of my schedule.\nPros:\nThe picture quality is outstanding. Worth well above what the TV costs, competing with TVs in the 80k+ range. Since this is what you buy a TV for, I would say it's a worthy purchase.\n\nCons:\nSound quality is average. You will need to invest in a sound system if you're planning to watch music/movies. Good enough for regular TV viewing, IMO.\nNot very \"smart\", for an Android TV. Sure you can download apps and watch YouTube, but you won't be able to sign in. So Netflix/Hotstar Premium etc are out of the window. You'll need to invest in a Chromecast and/or a Firestick if you're planning to stream content beyond regular YouTube.\n\nMy first impression is that if you're getting this TV for under 40k, go for it.",

It could be better\n3- u will have to be limited and dependent on app store given by vu as its os is opera os.\n4- miracast option is not as gud because while casting videos from mobile only picture is being cast but audio is not being played by tv..so u can say it only cast pictures, images...\n5- if u can compromise with all these given flaws so overall it is good product in market...\nSo on mid range go for it",

            "Picture Quality: 4. Crisp and Vivid colors. No Light bleeding detected yet.\nBuild Quality: 3. Could have been better for such a big and heavy TV.\nSoftware: 1. Utter Laggy Android. Most of the softwares force close. And no idea when any updates are going to come since its still running Android 7.0. I wont suggest installing many apps on this TV as it makes it lag heavily. You cannot use TV settings unless you are out of the home screen onto a different interface.\nInterface: 2. It has all the interfaces one may need but after you wall mount the TV you can't reach to the most important ones like USBs and HDMI (ARC). You will need to take the TV off of the wall and then put your USB devices in. Also, the wifi setup keeps switching back to ethernet. WHY?\nSound: The 2 speakers are OK for general viewing. But if there is noise nearby it may get difficult to hear. Like the dialogues will get missed if you are not paying too much attention towards the sound with just a fan running in your room or you'll have to turn up the volume to atleast 40 points.\n\nVu has cut corners in processor and ram hence the low price. But if you are going to install laggy processor then automatically the price will come down. Vu needs to understand the Indian market since the competition is getting bigger. Won't recommend if these little mistakes aren't fixed.\nThe CPU utilization is 100% with just one app running. Come-on Vu!\n\nTips: The stock media player can't run 4K(HEVC) x265 AC3-5.1/7.1 so install Kodi. It is a nice Media centre and can play almost anything on this TV. Though it still cannot play 4K (VP9) 60FPS HDR content properly.\n\nPlayStore: Goto Kodi>Android Apps> Playstore. when you click on it, it will launch Playstore. Though it is very slow on first runs but it works. :)\n\nVu get my issues fixed and i'll fix your product rating, because u should know how frustrating it is to know that your product doesnt work as intended from the first day.",

The worst thing is VU service, after few days only HotStar stopped working and after complaining they send one engineer with a PenDrive just to update HotStar or something else as even the engineer had no idea what he is doing But after that HotStar was fixed but YouTube is not updating again and the engineer had no idea what is the issue and how to fix so he left.

This is not Smart TV just Semi Smart so if you are looking for Smart please go for Android TV, it's little costly but worth.",
            "Do NOT buy this TV if you: (a) Want to cast screen from your phone, (b) Want to watch movies from your hard disk with subtitles, (c) Want to access input ports at the back when mounted on wall\n\nVu TVs are value for money. But only if you are going to just watch DTH or local cable on it. This particular TV has lot of small issues that frustrates the user. The screen is good, sound is decent. Other than that, following are the many niggles faced:\n\n1. When wall mounted, you cannot access any of the ports at the back. You have to remove the TV from the mount to access.\n2. You cannot access settings when using youtube or playing videos from hard disk (settings like adjusting picture or sound). To do that, you need to stop your video, go to the TV home screen, chose AVI as input, there change the settings, go back to main screen, then shift to different input then play your video. VERY frustrating.\n3. When you play netflix, the subtitles are perfect. But when you play video from your hard disk with subtitles, you can barely read the text on screen. It is opaque white and is almost useless having subtitles.\n4. When playing videos, sometimes there is random jump to different video.\n5. There is no gradual fast forward /backward option. You cannot move the video few seconds. It just jumps minutes.\n6. One of the biggest disappointments is casting from mobile. You need to download some shady looking app first on your phone, then open it and connect to TV. Then the phone is cast on the screen. But if you play a video on your phone, it plays the audio only on phone and does not cast to the TV. so you end up watching video on TV screen but audio from phone. And there is a big lag between video and audio.\n\nHaving purchased over four different Vu TVs to the household before with happy results, I was looking forward to this purchase. But the software issues and basic design issues is a huge disappointment.",

Live streaming in Hotstar does not work. Other apps does not work, when opened it crashed immediately.\niii. No 4k video playback support in youtube app.\niv. The WiFi setup automatically switch back to Ethernet mode every time you switch on the TV. Why? Its very frustrating.\nv. Mirroring works through Eshare. Only the picture gets mirrored to TV not the sound. And the screen mirroring become very slow.\n\nInterface (Rating 2): The interface is not good.\ni. The HDMI and USB ports are placed in such a way that after wall mounting those are not accessible. You have to uninstall your TV from wall to use those ports.\nii. None of the videos in the homepage opens. Its getting crashed immediately.\niii. No Bluetooth and poor connectivity.\niv. The home screen content does not update based on the user accessibility.\n\nSound (Rating 4): The sound quality is good. I have home theater connected to my TV and hence I don't bothered about the sound quality of TV.\nCustomer Care (Rating 2): The so called technicians are not at all technically sounds.

When your using cable/ chrome cast i am able to correct the picture settings- On Picture settings , i go to HDMI Mode and put it on Graphic option, and it improves the picture colours considerably. VU please release an update correcting the picture settings for the Smart App, since currently it is really bad and i am not able to watch anything because i am really disappointed by the colours.\nSecond problem is that the smart apps keep having problems, in the beginning Hotstar wasnt working, then the technician installed an update which made it work, post which netflix stopped working, i had to call the technician again and he said he had to install an update, why this constant problem??\nThirdly- It takes time for the internet to get connected to the TV, why the delay?",
