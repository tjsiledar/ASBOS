            "Excellent Led Smart Tv this Range\nSound quality excellent\nNet connectivity excellent\nRemote looking also excellent\nGoogle assistant also excellent",
            "This TV is a great purchase with all the lastest features. With Android 10, the TV is super smooth and the boot time is very very less as compared to other TVs. And also it boots up extremely fast if it is in stand by mode. Picture quality is just awesome and it is able to play 4K videos from youtube and at the same time it supports dolby vision which makes the picture quality more awesome (the video which you are playing should be Dolby vision as well). I did not have any connectivity issues till now. It connects to wifi very quickly and casting is pretty smooth (you need to have a good internet connection which will give you the best experience as far as the connectivity is concerned). I tried playing videos using a pendrive and it could play videos from there as well. Bluetooth pairing is fast and it can work as a transmiter and as well as receiver. From play store u can download a lot of apps. I did not try playing games till now. Only app i could not find is JioTV. Sound quality is excellent and it can get very loud (25% is quite loud for me) and dont forget to switch on dolby atmos. The remote is bluetooth paired and it works from anywhere as long as it is connected. TV installation was done by jeeves and the service engineer was well educated about the TV and installation was done very quickly and perfectly. He aslo gave a demo about the TV features and showed every thing he could. Overall I am happy with the TV, flikart's delivery, packaging and installation. I hope the TV will keep working good and also hoping for motorola's support in case of any issues.",

            "Used it for more than a month now. For seamless experience I wanted a TV with atleast 2 GB ram and 16 HD and I must say this tv's performance with 2 GB ram is far far better than all other TV's with 1gb of ram. Picture quality is absolutely stunning. Sound matches what they promise. This TV should be foremost priority for anyone planning to buy 32 inch tv. I have 32 inch realme and 43 inch VU tv installed at my home but this tv exceeds in all parameters when compared to them. I regret that I ...\nREAD MORE",

Overall TV is good ,Great product to take.",
            "Picture quality is not up to the mark. My old Samsung tv is giving better picture quality.\n\nUpdate: I have an issue with my Set-Top box. After getting a new set-top box now it is providing prominent picture quality. Still, I can say that Samsung has better picture quality if you want to choose cable TV.\n\nBut if you choose OTT services, this TV can show awesome quality \ud83d\udc4d\u2728, where Samsung lags a lot. For casting, if the default app is not installed, it is a bit laggy sometimes, where sony comes in place. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc4c\n\nOverall, I'm happy with the product.",

            "Upto 1 month using the tv. Pros and cons as follows-\nPros:\n1. Sound very good\n2. Picture quality descent(not expect somthing like premium bands but it is good)\n3. 5GHz wifi supported. Good connectivity\n4. Table stands are very good.\nCons:\n1. Build quality can be improved more.(not bad although)\nOverall good product. I am satisfied with it upto now.",
            "It's been a month of using this product and I'm pretty satisfied with the picture quality and really impressed with the sound quality and loudness it comes with. Being a non 4K TV it allows running 4K videos which various other TV of this range does not support and are restricted by the software itself. Connectivity is really good, it connects to the wifi and play highest quality videos without buffer at places where my mobile and laptop lack connectivity due to low range of wifi in that particular area, so the company must have implemented real strong wifi card inside. Overall, really satisfied with this purchase.",
            "Best in class product.\nWithin 1 day delivery, within 2 day's installation.\nBought at a lowest price of 16,000 rs.\n\nTotally satisfied with the overall experience, have recommended lot of my friends and they gave the same feedback.",
            "One of the best tv u can get in this price segment.good picture quality and sound quality also though the speakers are overrated but still the sound is clear but lacks bass.\nOverall picture quality is satisfactory but blacks are not tha good u can see some discrepancies on the screen when u watch a movie which has high blacks.\nConnectivity is good and the voice assistant works so well.",
            "Best buy , go for it . Dolby Sound system is excellent , display is supper , Technician is very supportive \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",
            "Picture and video quality of the tv is very nice but they need improvement in sound. It produces very less base effect. Using tv as a computer monitor, the picture and the text quality and clearity is not very good but it's ok it support 1920*1080 display resolution",
            "after use of 15 days.\nevery time connect Bluetooth speaker manually.\nonly set top box channels video quality is good. but when you try YouTube,hotstar or any other app for video, frames are dropping. pixels spread and view clearly blured.\nsame issue with mobile casting as well usb videos also.\nif you use only for set top box than you can definitely go with this tv. not recommended if your are using as smart tv.\nsound quality is impressive. not happy with this tv.",
            "I have been enjoying the experience of this TV with android OS. The best part is the Dolby atmos sound. The sound is good enough for most viewing. I keep the volume at 10. More than that neighbors get disturbed. For better base and theater like experience will definitely need soundbar with woofer. The picture quality is very nice, even though it is not 4K. For our requirement 1080p was more than enough for now. The bluetooth remote and the bluetooth connectivity is wonderful. I have kept a dedicated headphones in the hall for watching at night without disturbing anyone around. Just pair the headphones once and you're good to go.\n\nI have experienced TV restart a couple of times. This could be with the voltage fluctuation. Also I have noticed the voice recognition not working in the remote once. I restarted and it started working. It did not repeat so i did not call support still.\n\nOverall i am happy with the product and i would definitely recommend buying this.",
            "Best Android 10 Smart TV at this price range. The TV offers the best picture view and sound quality with the support of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. Motorola is probably the most preferable TV brand after Sony and Samsung in India.",
            "One of the best Tv from motorola, but price is bit more as in first it was Rs.13,999 and now it's more +1,500 i.e Rs.15,499 and apart from this all I will suggest you all go for this one with latest 10 Android OS and if you want cheaper than go for realme Tv exepct that Mi / OnePlus TV's.\nSound is just lit but didn't have bass so if you are bass animal buy an additional sound bar.",
            "Found this awesome product luckily while comparing best 32 inch hd TVs in YouTube. Worth buying it. Pricture quality is good. Sound quality is awesome. Connectivity and Software is best. No glitches so far. Response from remote is good. Voice control works fine. This is my first review after a month usage. Much better than other popukar brands.",
            "Excellent tv, supported all apps like prime video, hotstar, netflex, aha, sunnxt, airtel xtreme, sounds was amazing background ,",
            "It's been a month.. I enjoying the quality of features...\n1- you may not need of separate sound box. 40watts Inbuilt sound system gives you theatric experience..\n2- picture quality is also as good as the original..\n3- start mode is quicker than other tv s",
            "Sound output is loud and good enough.\nDisplay is also decent in this price range and 2 gb ram and graphics given in the tv is sufficient for playing even high end games available for tv like Asphalt.\n\nOver a decent product in this price range with good quality 40 watts speakers and graphics to handle most of the available tv games.",
            "Initial impressions with the TV after using it for 10 days. Picture quality and sound quality is very good. Worth the money for the specs this offers.\n\nFew issues observed.\nThis TV has support for 5ghz wifi but it was unable to connect automatically after restart of the TV. Works fine with the 2.4ghz wifi but issues is only with 5Ghz. Seems more of a software problem issue.\nInterface offered with the TV is not that intuitive as it is not easy to open apps which we use frequently.\nGoogle assistant works in opening the app but not the movie or videos inside the apps like hotstar or prime video.\n\nOverall issues seems to be with the software. Hopefully Motorola can fix and release an update.",

If you want great display great smasung but if you prefer overall good product then go for it. UI is also smooth no lags at all till now\nPS - you will get wall mount with it",

Doesn't even last for minutes and starts lagging and then stops working. Have tried with different phone same thing happened. Other thing is it shows model as flipkart tv makes you wonder if this is really motorola tv or what? Even after reset its model will always show as flipkart tv which even though should not matter but doesn't feel good to me.\n\nOver all its a good tv and if you you want to use it as a tv for HD content, this is a pretty good deal.",

One connectivity problem that I have noticed is with Netflix particularly when you are entering the pin to watch content that you may have protected. The cursor just does not move at all and when it does, it jumps if you have pressed multiple times. Another issue I have faced is of remote connectivity with tv since its a Bluetooth remote. At times, the tv dorsal respond when you press the buttons. It gets irritating when it doesn\u2019t even switch off when power button is pressed from the remote.

Infact when Dolby sound 5.1 is turn on you have increase TV volume upto 60-70 to get nice sound effects. Otherwise 15- 20 is good enough. Picture quality is nice. Software could have been better. It get stuck sometimes. Nice remote will so many buttons on it. It is little expansive than other TVs of similar catagory. Overall I find this TV an average.",

IPS panel was a must have at this price but unfortunately its a VA panel. unavailability of IPS panel takes away the clear viewing angle from sides (my Old VU TV had IPS and viewing from any angle was same experience, same color).

            "Value for money deal at 20k\n\nPros:-\n- sound quality is loud and good as you are getting 40watt speaker\n- Picture quality is also good. Don't compare it with Sony TV but still better at this price\n- two way Bluetooth. You can make this TV to receive audio (like from your phone like headphone) or transmit to external Audio system like home theatre system.\n- TV stand or wall mount piece in package is innovative and very simple, yet sturdy.\n- TV remote has voice recognition - Google assistance built-in\n- It's very light weight\n- Delivery and installation was quick from Flipkart\n- It has latest Android operating system\n- 2Gb RAM and 16Gb ROM is no other TV offering you in this range as on today.\nNote :- Its customized product in coordination with Flipkart and Motorola.\n\nCons :\nNot much if you consider at this price range, but good for once information\n- In source button at Remote, you won't find Us option. It's has all options like AV, HDMI etc...but for USB drive, you have to go through inbuilt app as media browser. This could have made simple by keeping it as a part of source button which is more logical way\n- The sound could have been with more baas. For music lovers, it may be disappointing. You have to use external woofer or home theatre.\n- Some channels like DD National, I could not foud easily. It couldn't be installed from playstore, but it's available under ZEE5 group of channels. We should have options to tag the favourite channels on walls which seems missing or I need to explore more.\n- the RYBG buttons on remote is of no use as per technician. I'm wondering why company would increase the remote size if of no use. But I guess it would be if you use normal dish/cable TV...which is not confirmed yet as I'm not using it. Good if company can explain or provide manual for use.\n- the manual with set is very basic 4page. No details if you don't have tech assistant. Big gap from company.\n\nVerdict - If you are standard user, with Little more than basic entertainment requirements...this is best value for money. Close your eyes and go ahead. Good product from Motorola and Flipkart",

I wish the sound were little bit more bassy. Being a bass lover I miss it. Considering its 40 W sound output, woofer like bass could have worked like wonders.\n\n2. It's a bit unresponsive although very rarely .\n\n3. Aspect ratio could have been worked upon .\n\n4. Power consumption is on the higher size. May be because of its 40 W sound output.\n\nOverall it's a decent purchase. I would recommend you all to go for it.

Dolby vision and capability of playing 4k content makes the display quality better, even it is hd panel but picture quality feels like full hd.\n3. 2gb ram and 16gb storage makes it easy to download more apps and play games also.\n4. Only tv with android 10.\n5. Dual band wifi support gives you strong net connectivity and speed.\n6. Fully functional big remote gives you more control than regular android tv remote, 4hot keys, dpad control, numeric keypad, forward, backward, play, pause keys makes it easy to navigate and control.\n7. Wall mount bracket is provided with tv.\n8. 2 usb port, 2 hdmi port, digital audio output makes it easy for connectivity also it supports hdmi 2.0 support and arc support.\n\nCons\nI have found one cons that is it doesn't have 3.5mm jack which is necessary for connecting old type speakers or headphones but tv sound is enough you will not need any external speaker",

I tried connecting apple airpods pro with this to experience atmos. OK. Not so good. May be I didn't played the correct content. Was tried some spatial effects video on YouTube. Will try again with Dolby atoms supported movie.\nTV inbuilt 40w speaker - loud enough for the movie dialogs( very loud. Total 100 level volumes) and you doesn't feel any punchy bass. Better to buy any external speaker for bass.\nTV REMOTE - can give 5/5 star for remote with all the necessary buttons. Buttons are smoother than Samsung. Didn't tried any games since it have 2gb ram, I think it can support some decent game with wireless controller.

Or do the vise versa.\n\nConnectivity.\nScreen mirroring works fine. But sometimes it slowls down but wait I found the solution. Just disconnect if its slow and reconnect again. Do this 2-3 times or more it'll get fixed.\nWifi and Bluetooth works fine.\n\nAlso download duck duck go browser (other browser not working/ not installed), jiotv from third-party apks , might helpful\n\nOverall good tv but if it had a sub bass it would be perfect deal.",

            "Review after initial usage.\n\nPanel Quality is very cheap. I mean like seriously cheap. Amusingly the model name of the TV is Flipkart TV everywhere and not ZX2, so it makes me think whether its just a rebrand of Marq TVs! Side by side compared it with MI 40 inch and Sony Bravia 32\".\n\nPicture and Sound Quality of 4 Years old Sony Bravia is way better than this. In terms of MI, picture quality of MI was found to be better with more accurate colours, whereas sound was bit better of Motorola.\n\nAlso, my sony has 30 watt speakers which is way louder and better than Motorola 40 watt speakers with Dolby Atmos. Almost double. So it is not actually 40 watt speakers but 20 actually at max.\n\nAnother problem I encountered was that with every Boot Up, the TV first enters into channel scan or whaterver source mode you have kept(say hdmi 1) default and you need to press home to go to smart tv android homepage. It wont directly boot up to android tv home page like every other android tv and there is no option to change. A big con for me who just wants to use smart tv features like Netflix and Prime videos etc. and doesn't need to use any type of input source. With every bit I have to hit an extra button to use my tv normally.\n\nPros : 1. Connectivity options\n2. Good Processor.\n3. Ram and storage\n4. Dolby Audio and Video\n5. Remote with some extra features\n6. 4K runs on YouTube, Prime Video and Netflix automatically.\n7. Latest Android\n8. Metal Stands\n\nCons : 1. Flipkart TV and not Motorola.\n2. No different than previous android version. Exactly same.\n3. Sound Quality not as good as advertised.\n4. Picture quality and colors not at all upto the expectations\n5. Cheap Panel Quality.\n6. Very short lenght of Power Cord.\n7. No external adapter present on the power adapter\n8. Google Assistant was having alot of troubles recognizing voices but not sure because I had plastic cover on the remote.\n9. No apps button on tv remote.\n10. Bulky remote. MI remote is by far the sleekest best remote.\n\n\nWill edit with every discovery.\n\nAlso, if flipkart rejects my review, I am suing them for fraud and hiding facts and misappropriation of reviews on a product page.\n\nEdit 1(29/11/20) - Software is extremely buggy and there is not a single software update or fix since launch. Also, motorola customer support is really worthless and unhelpful. They dont even know their own product. They just sold their brand name rights to flipkart. Flipkart is manufacturing, servicing, marketing and selling the TV. Motorola just gave its name. It seems a star will start to fall from my review with every passing month. Serious TBH. Best if you just want to enjoy normal live tv from your cable or dth operator. Bad for Android TV and OTT experience.",

Everything works just fine\n*Dual band wifi which is again future ready.\n\nCons-\nWarranty - Only 1 year warranty on tv. LG is giving 3 years. This makes me question the quality of panel. I just hope it works fine for years to come.\n\nSo all in all, it is the best tv. 1 GB, Android 9 tvs are now obsolete. Go for this, if you don't mind the warranty.

But in certain cases AI in video processing makes some videos look artificially fair and we don't get the true image... Motorola should provide function to disable it's AI function.\n\nAudio is not okay.. Without Dolby Atmos switched on it is just pathetic. Even with the Dolby Atmos turned on it is lacking punch (Bass) and clarity... seems Motorola has not provided the hardware (woofer/sound system) to compliment the software. HDMI ARC supported in HDMI1 is a great feature and using a HDMI sound bar can improve the audio quality.\n\nNetwork support for both dual band wifi is a BONUS specially since the TV supports 4K content streaming.. Cannot ask more in this price bracket.\n\nAndroid OS performance is excellent , boot time is good no noticeable lags. Gaming .. no compatible joystick Found after trying a few.",

This product has the best CPU and and a faster GPU and also has more RAM and ROM in this segment. Which ensures a fluid experience all the time.\n.\nIt comes with Android 10 out of the box and the fluidity shows how well configured this chipsets are with the latest OS.\n.\nOne can play contents on Hotstar, Prime Video, Netflix, YouTube smoothly even on 4k.\n.\nIt has more RAM and Storage then any other TV in this segment, which will ensure it won't go slow even after the future updates.\n.\nPicture quality is superb.\nThe Vivid profile is high in contrast and personally I felt like it makes content more bluish rather than making it colorful.\nPersonally I like the Movie profile as it has decent contrast, sharpness and a bit flat profile.\n.\nIt has VA panel so it looses clarity marginally (becomes little whiteish) if you watch TV from sides. (But why would anyone do that).\n.\nIt supports and plays HDR content smoothly. One can see HDR notification popping on the top left screen while playing a HDR content.\n.\nIt supports Dolby Vision, but off course you will need to watch a Dolby Vision content to enable it.\n.\nSound quality is loud and clear. But obvious we get 40W Sound System with Dolby Atmos and DTS Sound.\n.\nThe Remote is fantastic. It has all the buttons required. (Not like the new types which has very less buttons, in which you had to press more buttons to do a certain task)\n.\nI wish they had included a remote hard case. (As I don't think there's any physical ON - OFF switch on the TV). If something goes wrong with the remote, you won't be able to turn ON or OFF your TV.\n.\nPersonally I felt, the WIFI chipset used is a bit of a lower range. Coz I can connect to WIFI on my One Plus device but on TV it shows out of range. (Using my old android device as wifi repeater)\n.\nAlso something is wrong with the Chromecast, while I played a movie the audio and video was out of sync. And a major drawback is you need an active connection (data) to connect via Chromecast.\n.\nThe back side of the TV becomes very very hot after just a hour of usage. I hope it will survive the heat. (If something burns because of the heat, I don't think they will cover it in the warranty).\n.\nPS: This TV's are manufactured by Flipkart, which means all the after sales services will be provided by Jeeves. And almost everyone knows how highly negligible they are with there product services.\nIn case you don't know, you should google \"Jeeves after sales services on Quora or YouTube anywhere you like\".",

The description says it has headphone jack whereas it doesn't have one.\n\n2. The description says it has Prime video pre-installed. Actually it is not. Also while searching Prime Video app in Play Store it doesn't show. So i had to sideload the app.\n\n3. In the description it is also mentioned thay 6 months Spotify Subscription is free but have not given the details to claim the same.\n\n4. The sound is really good but bass is missing. Those expecting high bass as per the description of speakers will be disappointed as i was.\n\n5. The Bluetooth sound quality is good but the volume level has to kept more than 50-60 % for loudness and kindly note that the TV doesn't support Dolby Atmos or Dts sound effects on Bluetooth audio.",

            "Nice Product \ud83d\udc4d",
            "I am writing the review after using the TV for over a week.\n\nDolby Atmos: The sound quality is very good; one can distinctly hear all the beats. Further, one can choose a user mode, if interested, but I quite like the auto mode.\n\nDolby Vision: Given that it is an FHD and not a UHD, the picture quality is very good. One should not expect a UHD quality on this TV. Then the colours rendered are crisp. The black colour is pure black and the white colour is pure white without any blue tint which is very good. All other colours are distinct. I found that, in auto mode, the dimming or brightening was not as efficient as I expected but I used the user settings as per my choice and I am happy with the output.\n\nOperating System: The TV got about 1GB download at the time of installation to upgrade itself to the latest Android 10. Android 10 brings with itself a lot of benefits like dark mode, an efficient operating system, etc. Hope, Motorola provides continuous updates and upgrades.\n\nOne thing I liked was that the TV remembers the last few operations quite well, so when you press the back button, it will play the last item that was being played, so you don't have to go and search that channel again.\n\nRemote Control: Remote control could have been slicker. It has lots of buttons which are useless for the TV. If someone is using a dish TV, maybe it was more useful. I expected a smaller and simpler remote control with fewer buttons like most of the other brands are providing.\n\nThe icing on the cake is Flipkart's unmatched customer care.",

Whether it's completely dark or light room ... You will get best picture quality as you have modes for picture according to your need !\n2)The best thing about this is SOUND, Dolby Atmos is just simply insane ... So loud and clear... Even in sound you get modes to set it according to your need !!!\n3)Lag free experience, absolutely no lag at all as the interface is really fast courtesy of 2GB ram and 16 GB internal storage\n4) Software update - Android is very fluid ... I had an update of 1 Gb when I installed it and it is working very well...\n5)You have the option to buy an external warranty worth 1175 for 2 years which I bought .... Not very expensive guys... This is an electronic item and can happen any kind of issue in future... So totally I have now 3 years of warranty from JEEVES\n6) Installation was done within 3 hours of delivery and delivery person was so gentle and explained everything very well\n\nAlthough this looks kind of simple TV, they could have given different colour metal stand like nokia to give it an elegant look, also the sound bar is integrated, while the sound bar on Nokia TV looks better .... Another thing is that we would have to use 2 remote if we want to play normal TV since our DTH set top box can't pair android TV remote... So this remote control is just for TV features and DTH remote is for channel watching\n\nBut overall, no complaints at all ... This product might look normal from Outside but it's technically beast from Inside...\n\nI bought this product for 12750 during sale and I feel it's very very good buy for this product !",
