            "Picture clarity is very good, almost comparable to the leading brands like Samsung and Sony. Sound quality is very poor, I have to keep volume as high as 70+.\nIf your planning on wall mounting there is hardly any space for reaching the HDMI or USB drive slot.\nValue for money at the moment for this price. In one way, it's unfair to compare it to high end televisions.",
            "Good Value for Money.\nwriting this review after 10 days of purchase.\nPicture Quality:\nPicture quality and 4K experience is really good and I had a slight concern when I read the customer reviews before purchase.. but now, I don't feel that as bad and I recommend this as best one in this budget.\n\nSound Quality:\nYou will be amazed when you hear the output from this.!!\nYes, Output is too Clear and Crystal. You don't need a sound-bar from this. It supports different format and FLAC one throws the best \ud83d\udc4c\n\nConnectivity & Apps:\nHere comes the major part which fulfills the SMART TV.\nI was in oscillation with Vu Android Premium 4K SMART Tv(No Amazon Prime access) by reading the reviews. Still not convinced with service / service centers by Vu.\nYes, connectivity issues are there with Bluetooth remote. Twice it got disconnected and couldn't turn on the TV. luckily, I had a Mi Mobile to turn on the Device and re-paired the remote. No flaws in WiFi connectivity and with other ports. works perfectly. mobile Hotspot doesn't stream 4K videos. You need more patience in using Apps as it takes time to load and each time when you switch on the TV. Since it has Low RAM, this cannot be rectified., I have not installed any other app to experience it. may be Mi can fix other connectivity issues thru Software Update.\nstill I'm not satisfied in this area.\n\nDelivery & Installation:\n**5Star** Flipkart does this best which takes away the users from other sites.\n\nVerdict: Perfect Package at this budget with all features. Good Picture Quality (best with Vivid mode) & True Sound.\n\nCons:\nYou may feel insecure and low trust because of connectivity issues reported.\n\nSuggestions:\nI recommend to go with this TV additionally with 3 years extended warranty. wen compared to other competitors Mi has more service centers.\ncheck all the connectivities within 10 days of purchase especially with Remote, WiFi, YouTube streaming.\n\nHope this review will help little bit in taking decisions.",

I mean u wont feel a difference if u run a normal video, go for UHD or 4k videos or atleast Full HD videos. Sound was loud, good. And I didnt faced any connectivity issues yet, I connected the TV with wifi and the Netflix and youtube was smooth. Patch wall 2.0 is quite nice feature. I recommend this TV. Thanks flipkart!",

Excellent 5* product within that price bracket for the kind of features it has.\n\nA bit disappointed with the delivery timeline as it took 2-3 days more than what i have expected but the installation was quick.",
            "One of the best decisions I've made. As a LG user I was not sure if the Mi 4x would live up to it's promises but I am glad to say it's a beast. The picture quality is crisp and 4k videos play flawlessly. Android interface provides an ease of use. The new look of patchwall is refreshing and is loaded with tons of content. Both Netflix & Prime Videos work flawlessly on this smart tv. I've read a few negative comments about connectivity but as far as I've used the feature - it works well. The Bluetooth remote is very responsive and so is the Google voice assistant. The only let down(though not a deal breaker) is the sound quality. I believe the speakers are placed in such a way(at the bottom) that it would work well on a tabletop but not on wall mount. Having said that, the sound quality is not bad. At this price range you couldn't have asked for more. I am really loving it.",

The only improvement requires is sound output, which overall is good but could have been a bit better but the way Panels are getting thinner I am sure soon the sound will have to be added later so in a way it is descent output considering the future panels. It\u2019s been 02 months and haven\u2019t had any issues.",
            "my delivery was late but my installation was very fast and good demo the product is very nice and good sound and good picture quantity picture quality was amazing",
            "I have purchased 65inch about 10 days back for 55k . I am happy so far that delivery, installation and performance of TV is very good. I could not explore all the features of the tv yet. This TV is value for money as similar TVs with brand name are costing 3 to 6 times of its price.\nI am not a techno savvy person as I am 60 +, hence my comments on features may not correctly reflect reality. But I feel this tv is a very good buy.\nEarlier I had purchased VU tv 43 inch from flipkart in 2015, which has worked for more than 4 years without a single problem.\nI happy with overall service from flipkart and products sold by them",
            "Must buy product!\n\nPROS:\nThe TV has Superb Picture Clarity & Brightness. 18Kg is not much of weight! Sound is amazing at 20W... I didnt feel like to attach additional speakers! Completely covers my 6x5 Bed. There is NO LED Bleed... But Sometimes a bleed of 1inch occurs at the bottom left corner but most of the times the Dark screen makes me fall in love! 4K videos run super smooth! HD STB with All HD channels recommended to buy! Upscaling capability/algorithm is great!\n\nCONS:\nInstallation service is very poor. Jeeves is a super lathergic company. Installed the TV after 7 days of delivery and repeated follow-ups, complaints after promised date. The first technician alloted had zero knowledge. Upon complaining to flipkart they re-allocated a new technician. Wall mount costed INR 500 with no rotating available. Patchwall is least useful app for me! Miracast (laptop screen mirroring) sometimes freezes! Google home (Mobile screen mirroring) sometimes doesnt detect CAST!",

            "I purchased this Mi TV 55 inch from flipkart after searching for best 4K Android TV under 45000 rupees. After using it for few days now I can say that Xiaomi is providing best value for money smart Android TV with great display and sound quality. Even its service is very fast. I am loving this Android TV with lots of useful features like bluetooth, wifi, google assistant, all major apps support. 55 inch is perfect size for a ideal living room and I am very happy by the service and offers provided by flipkart.",

            "Fast connectivity. Very easy interface. Nice picture quality and decent sound. Best tv under 25k!",
            "I bought the 65 inch 4k panel. The android interface is good and fast while the picture quality is amazing. If you go for a 65 inch model be sure to get tilt-able wall mount. Very happy with my purchase but wouldn't recommend now as we are boycotting Chinese manufacturers.",
            "i never thought you can get a 65inch tv so good for this price. i have a samsung 75inch which is for 4 times the price of this and you would not be able to make out the difference after some time. not much. althought we did recieve the tv one day late but forgiven. if you have a budget for Rs 60000 the go for this tv. personally gurantee, you will love it.",
            "The TV in overall package is really great however the modem that is inbuilt for WIFI connection to be established is not upto the expectation which results in the content being buffered on the TV despite other devices work well with the WIFI connection and show great speeds on them as well. The only thing that i am not happy about is Flipkart itself for the delivery being so slow and unpredictable. TV is great for now until i plan for a big one..lol..",

Value for money\n2. Simplistic UI\n3. Slim profile\n4. Good display\nCons\n1. Connectivity issue sometime\n2. Speaker could have been better\n3. Wall mount not included",
            "Sd Chanel's also displays good without blurr sound quality good.",
            "The quality of tv is so good at this price. Yes it is a 4k tv that has a good viewing experience. The only thing you should upgrade is your wifi router for 4k streaming. If the wifi router has 150mbps of speed then you cannot play a 4k video in this tv. A speed of atleast 300 - 600mbps of router will give you an amazing experience.\n(The speed iam talking about is not internet speed, the router speed - router capacity of transferring data)\n.\n.\nOver all this TV is fabulous at this price range.\nEnjoy! Cheers!",
            "Bought this smart TV on the first week of March and now I'm reviewing this in August. 4K panel is awesome and works flawless when I'm connecting it to my PC...but that's it. WiFi is a pain to connect. When I watch YouTube and Netflix and some videos on the apps, it keeps on buffering and will let me log out of the app which is really weird because I have a 70Mps plan and it works flawless on my other devices. I thought an update will fix this issue but it never has. Really disappointed with the TV. I'm just holding to it because I can connect it to my PC.",
            "Product is good overall in this budget. I do not see any color bleed and it seems LG panel is making quite an impact on this model. It's real eye candy to watch 4k and full hd is so good to watch on such a huge screen! Sound is enough for drawing room; in fact just enough for normal news and serial watching. If you want to make it a home theater, then Boat Avante 2000 160w is a killer deal and I'm surprised to see that an under 10k sound bar can give such a run for money to costly siblings. However, following features must be addressed by MI in their next OT update for this TV:\n\n1- No quick way to change the sound output. Every time you have to quit watching to access settings, change the output and come back launch the program again\n2- Pixel UI sometimes crashes. More testing is needed. I found a way to correct it whenever it conks. Just change the theme from light to dark and vizaviz\n3- Data Saver option always resets back to ON after restarting the TV. It's annoying when I have a dedicated broadband line and don't need this feature at all.\n\nI have given extra star only because of the Flipkart delivery system. They are best at handling fragile items. Same day installation was another surprise and the folks were super professional. This shows that brands are now taking Indian market seriously and know that good customer service will go long way.",
            "Used for a week. till now great experience. Good quality Pic. Sound is OK. Within the price range one of the best item you can get. will update after some more months",

Google assistant built in the remote is very useful and works perfectly fine. Thanks to flipkart for super quick delivery and installation of the TV. Very happy with this purchase.",
            "Everything is Best.\nThe Delivery, and the installation was done on the day of delivery with in hours which was the best thing happened.\nThe Installation guy was very good with the knowledge about the television.\nThe only con I've observed was the Casting.\nCasting is not good. Hope it can be solved with proper system update.\nAnd also Casting is working only when phone and tv connected to same WiFi which is not happened in other popular brands.\nCasting connectivity totally cuts that 1 star rating.\nOverall the picture quality,sound and performance is the best in this price point. I do recommend this TV to who ever wants to buy it.",

            "Using the product for couple of weeks. So far satisfied. It is very good value for the money however there are technical glitches and you would find tough if you are not so tech savvy... Some points worth to note, there is No background data saver option as advertised ; tv remote stopped working (power button) after (probably) a automatic software update. I had to factory reset to recover my remote power button. Patch wall is just a launcher (like what you see in your smartphone) all the pre installed app needs paid subscription (except you tube) so amount of free content is only in the advertisement.. This tv doesn't come with wall mount accessories.. Flip cart service took 500 to get the wall mount.. Tv panel is not fps like high end tvs... And don't expect the quality as Sony /Samsung /LG. However if you are not so sure and don't want to invest much on TV, then this is the option you may go for.. <25k for an uhd 43 inch is no brainer.. You simply can't beat this price and go wrong..",
            "value for money but their is sound issue when Airtel Android 4k set top box connection, their is video but no sound so require good knowledge technician other wise in this price best deal",
            "I had high expectations about the product due to high media hype about it by MI as well as by users. However, the picture quality while using cable channels is greatly disappointing and about, the so called dolby dts sound, the output is very very less and effect is horrible. The quality of sound does not match with the big screen TV. instead of woofer, MI has provided only poor quality of 20 W speakers which are suitable for voice only. Music or film can not be enjoyed with inbuilt speakers while we had enjoyed the great 10 w speakers provided by Sony in 32 inch tv. While playing videos, especially 4K videos, its spectacular and mind blowing. I use extra sound system through, then it is awesome. However, when I think of the amount I paid for the product, I forget all the defects and short comings and simply enjoy the show. No other company can give this product with this much low price. At my home, We four people use MI phones as well. With this product, we have become great fan of MI. thank you MI. With warm regards. Sudhakaran Wadakancheri",

            "The MI TV (65\") is really a beast! No other words can be used to describe the experience.. Thanx Xiaomi... Talking about the TV, the picture is superb - full 5 Stars; however the sound is satisfactory, not great but pretty okay.. Other features are also nice, including connecting with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth devices... In short, the Xiaomi MI 4X TV is well worth the price at Rs.55k. However, the installation by JEEVES was not up to the mark.. The technician was not a professional and took a long time in setting up the TV.. further he came without an assistant, due to which I was forced to help him by holding the TV upright for almost 20 mts.. Not a nice experience at all.. However, I must reiterate the fact that the Xiaomi MI tv 65 inches in itself is a piece of art! Thanx XIAOMI once again",

You cannot hear anything clear in normal movies and only during any songs or action scenes suddenly sound picks up. No options to select any other sound mode or no equalizer make things very difficult. Have to keep volume levels really high to listen anything clearly. I should have trusted Sanyo over MI. Japanese rules in sound. Any suggestions to rectify this issue???",

Highly satisfied with the product considering the price range.\nThe only thing that dissapoints a bit is the operating system. The TV takes time to open up and there is bit of lag when it opens. Also when playing 4K content sometimes there the audio and video tracks are not in sync. You need to clear cache and restart the video to being them in sync. It's an OS issue and should be fixed by Mi via update.",

But can be compensated a little when using Vivid display mode.\n- Screen resolution is good\n- Good Viewing angle makes it easy to watch\n\nBuild Quality - 3.5/5\n- Display is loosely attached to bezel\n\nPerformance - 3.5/5\n- It lags a little during screen navigation.\n- Takes little longer to Start and Shutdown.\n\nOverall I would rate it as 4/5. We should not forget the TV Price. Mi TV 4X 43\" inch is worth its price.\n\nI did see few review comments regarding Wifi connectivity issue. I didn't face disconnecting issue till now. WiFi seems working perfectly fine.",

But trust me the quality of Picture is not at all lower than any Branded company like Sony, Panasonic or Samsung.\n\nThe wifi connectivity is also very stable and till now didn't face any issue. The 4k picture from youtube is just awesome...\nSound is very powerful and sweet.

Installation is done at the specified time . WiFi connectivity is not OK better to connect internet using suitable cable. Mirroring works well. Other Android apps works well in this TV. You have to adjust volume (sound) for each channel which is a minus.",

There is no mute button in the remote and everytime we have to switch to hdmi for channels in set-up box moreover everytime we have to press power button in tv remote to start .Picture quality doesn't seems like 4k. Better to go for a normal hd tv in companies like sony and samsung. overall if you want to experience a high class picture and sound quality i don't recommend this. If you are not particular about quality and for temporary usage it will be a decent option.",

            "manufacturer not checked properly and not set back side screw's properly .\noverall it's ok for 4k digital clearty ,\nsound only 4k videos and not good for normal video mode.",
            "Was waiting for 4X Ultra HD sale of MI tv and I got it.\n\nThe display is superbly clear and the sound is a bit on lower side and loudness can be achieved only after reaching 35 level of sound. So a soundbar of any make is a must to enjoy the movies.",
            "Overall I am happy with my new MI 4x 43 inches TV, and I am writing my experience here:\n\n1. 4K and HD quality works excellent with this TV.\n2. In most of other user reviews I seen they mentioned about TV Audio quality is not up to mark. however i analysed this point very closely and found, Sound is Good and audible clearly, but sound quality going UP/Down on the basis of applications from where you run the your audio/video song.\n3. There are no in-built voltage stabilize, you should have to buy it, if light fluctuation in your area.\n4. During installation, my Jeeves\u2019s representative told me, if we don't install voltage stabilizer at the time of installation, we don't cover warrant of TV if something happened due to voltage fluctuation. I didn't get reply over this from Flip cart till now, will update you guys, and once get any update on this.\n5. Quality of stand is not up to mark, seems very low quality.\n6. For wall mount you don't need to pay any extra penny to Jeeves person, as it\u2019s already free. Only you have to pay INR 500, if you purchased wall mount from that person.\n7. There are no option to mute audio, which I think MI missed. There should be mute option at report.\n8. Build quality is low, if you touch corner of TV, you found some gap.\n9. SD channels is display is not good, you could found better experience with at least 780 Resolution video.\n10. Screen mirroring option is available with this TV and working fine.\n11. Up time is little bit high as compared to other branded TVs like Samsung and Sony\n12. No Lag to play video, if you have good internet speed. you should have at least 20 mbps speed to watch 4k videos\n13. It hang, you give multiple command through Google Assistance. else, Google assistance work flawless.\n14. Approx. 4.4 GB space available to use initially.\n15. They mentioned it have HDR 10, I don't think it have, however picture quality is good.\n16. In dark screen, picture quality get little bit down, I don't think it have more than 200 - 250 nits brightness",

            "So, TV is superb, picture quality is awesome. main highlights are patch wall and Google assistant. you can search any video on you tube or app by saying with Google assistant remote. It comes so handy and useful, not only videos on YouTube .. you can ask anything from Google assistant and get result on your TV. sound is absolutely fine with the price we are paying. I have coupled it with Sony Bluetooth soundbar and result is mind-blowing(no need to connect via any wire and for that reason you can couple your Bluetooth headphone as well). it is no less then a theatre if coupled with a sound bar. I also add ir cable from mi so I can use same remote for set top box Operations, can change channel by just saying the channel name. and channel results gets listed in favourite and patchwall as well. better to go with 50 inch if price is under your budget (bigger is better). also do subscribe HD channels, as those channels will show picture quality of this TV!!",

            "Writing this review after 1 day, I am fully satisfied with this Mi 4x 43\" TV. I got delivered this TV on 10th day as flipkart already said while placing the order. After delivery installation and demo done by Jeeves on next day in a very good manner. I want to wall mount the TV, so service engineer brings a good quality of metallic wall mount stand with him and I pay him 500 rs. After installation, I got an update of 875 MB & got new Miracast app for direct casting which is too good. If you want Miracast app for direct casting then you should go for the update. Wireless Connectivity is very good,there are no any problems faced. Picture quality 4/5, Sound quality 4/5, Connectivity 5/5. All the functions and features ie. Google Chromecast are working properly. I am not faced any problems. Remote working fine. USB ports, headphone jack and HDMI ports are working properly. SPDIF ports are not tested yet.But I don't think there will be any problems which will be I facing. HDMI 1 port I am using for my Tata Sky dish which is working fine. HD channels are very good to see. HD Channels 5/5, SD Channels 4/5. Viewing angle only from straight is very very good but from left and right is bad, picture quality turns in little bit whiteness. But it will not affect too much.\nFrom my opinion, you should definitely go for this TV. In this price this is very good TV. Calling and messaging by flipkart,delivery boy and installation boy is very good.",
            "This is a good product... Sound is good.. everything is perfectly fine... If you have any plan to buy this product, then go ahead.. trust me it's a good television.",
            "Excellent customer service from Flipkart. The television is really worth for the price i paid. But\nThe drawbacks are as follows\n- slow start and connectivity (takes over 15-40 secs for the software to load)\n- wifi connectivity is moderate\n- specific apps malfunction often (youtube,vlc,mxplayer,etc)\n- just 2GB ram (definitely not helping and the ROOT CAUSE FOR ALL SLOWNESS)\n- IF there is a way to extend RAM then all my issues would be solved\n\n\nPROS -\n- The picture quality is really good. Even though its not as fluidic as major televisions, this tv is far better than 40k samsung and sony televisions\n- Well Size matters (43inch was a bang)",

It will not work even you update the software, I was lot of times raised a complaint to customer care. Finally they gave a solution that the change the inside board at a cost of 8000 Rs. So i denied and after that I'm not using internet till now.\n\nThis is very much expensive TV and quality of control is very very bad. And, more followings are,\n\n\n1) Remote is not quality at all, too weightless.\n\n2) Overall experience: Please do not waste your money to purchase this model.",

            "Very Good tv for the price. However newer TV's have better speakers and Dolby sound. The picture quality is not upto samsung or sony panels(obviously). I use it with ps4 and doesn't have any problem.\nThe only problem im facing is that I can't change sound output when the 3.5mm jack is plugged in. I'll have to remove 3.5mm everytime I want the sound to come from the TV inbuilt speakers. The alternative is to buy a coaxial to 3.5mm dac or a hdmi dac.",

And sound is very poor,you can't enjoy the music because it has no Bass. Sound is also not much loud as company says it has 20w speaker. But my 16w bluetooth speaker has much loud and deep bass.

I have contacted service centre the people came to my house and checked but the guy who came even he is not aware of the issue, whereas i can see the same issue in all the MI tvs whether it is 43 inch or 55 inch.. Check youtube videos before buying... They are just looting people... Just because the cost is cheaper then other brands like sony and all dont fall for it... the quality is more cheaper then the price.... Till now they have not given any solution it has been 2 months now... They assured me to replace the panel as they are not sure about the issue... But till date no replacement of TV or panel is recieved.. Dont go for this product.... even if they replace there is no assurity that the new one will survive for much longer and if the warranty period is over you need to repair the TV at your own cost and at that repair cost you can buy another brand new TV. So if any one is planning to buy it then please change your mind... Almost everyone is facing the same issue after few month of usage. These chinese brands are just useless... They are only providing the logos of Made in India but the actual technology is of China only... So think twice before wasting your hard earned money.\n\nThanks",

TV resolution often gets Frozen for a while and doesn't even respond to remote button press. Spoke to support and they asked me to reset the device which will wipe all login credentials !! Ahh that's a great solution.\nApart from that TV sound sucks, as we already know it's a 20 watts speaker but no sign of Dolby digital as mentioned on TV box or flipkart website.\nNot sure if remote have issues as it stops responding when we press button in front or from different side (as it's an Bluetooth remote).",

You can't expect better !\nPros\nPicture quality\nSound clarity\nUSB and hdmi ports\nApp support\n\nCons\nConnectivity..\nAnd that's it.\nOnce you connect via Miracast, suddenly tv will hang. But if you exit and redo the same , it will get established. But, this is a minor issue , in view of the price and other advantages.\nFew reviews mentioned the discomfort with the location of USB port, if wall mount is used. But for me it didn't seem so. You can easily reach to the USB ports with (with average sized forearm!) or better to use an extension cable.\nVolume can't be increased more , so if you are a high volume lover , go with additional sound bar. You will love it...\n\nOverall, it's just a beauty ! Price worthy and value for money ! Go for it.. I am updating it after one month of use .",

You should receive a call in morning next day. Avoid calling many times to the person to avoid irritation on his part.\n\nEnsure to take a video when installation person is opening the box.

So I don't like built in speaker sound. So I got f&d 3800x 5.1, put 2 surround rear speakers on my bed side tables and OMG, NOW I have got theatre like sound experience with this tv.\n\nConnectivity: Awesome, chromecast works flawlessly, bluetooth supports wireless earphones, data saver is good.\n\nFor Gaming: I use PS4 Pro, It supports 4k with HDR on PS4 too!!!\n\nMotion smoothening: it's awesome, makes your low frame video look like high frame one. Awesome for 30fps games, feels like 60 while motion smoothness is on.\n\nBest TV EVER",

There is hidden setting menu for hdmi or analogue input which can be accessed by holding then releasing the selection button(button at center of arow keys) on the remote. Here you can customise many settings deleted to both audio and video. Sound quality is great when set to movie mode. Bluetooth headphone is supported. You can enjoy the best quality if it is used as a monitor for your PC. Best quality in this case is can be achieved by accessing the hidden setting when on the hdmi screen and setting the the DNR(dynamic range) to high(which is called HDR). You can't buy 4k monitor at this prize\ud83d\ude05. The TV has a super smooth UI. It's processor is better then Intel's pentium processors. This TV has high contrast levels, rich colours and the screen brightness is too enough. I set to 30%.\n\nCons:\nThe android ui resolution is not 4k. May be for maintaining performance.\n\nThere is no detailed catalogue in the box, It is just a minimal information.\n\nWhile playing 4k HDR(Normal 4k videos perform well) videos on youtube the colours are little bit dull. But no problem for the same video played on native video player.\n\nRemote control has too minimum buttons. Could have been better if more buttons are included, such as volume mute button.\n\nA light sensor can be included to make the tv even smarter( for auto brightness adjustment). My old tv had one.",

Google data saver is really awesome which reduces the data usage and shows the data alert\n6.everything is perfect, I dint find any con's at the price level, overall good buy,\n7. installation was done the same day of delivery, additional 500 has to be paid for wall mount\n8.This tv isn't displayed in any of the Tv showrooms, if this tv kept for compression no other brand tv's would sell, Tx to Mi\n9.

There is no mute button on the remote and you need to reduce the volume completely to mute it.\n3. Due to extreme picture resolution the literature content on the TV is too small.\nEyes are strained(Some of the foreign languages subtitles on Netflix and Hotstar.)\n4.

            "This is a review after go through Mi 4x 4k 43 inch\n\nPros.\n\n1. Good picture quality with 10 bit panel\n2. ARC works fine with sony 5.1 surround sound\n3. All TV version Android apps running including other source apps which you can download from third party\n4. All type of video and audio format supported through USB\n5. And the most important part that bothered me most before purchase. Yes you can use it as 4k monitor with high performance graphics PC with high speed HDMI 2.0 cable. Don't ask about chroma certification, I don't know, I tried to find that out but its specified no where for MI 4X. I tried 4K gaming and its worked fine with 50 FPS that decent performance. And no text scramble so guess it has chroma 4:4:4\n6. Design good. Small basle.\n7. TV inbuilt speakers are good\n8. Got one day delivery and one day installation... So Flipkart thank-you\n\nCons.\n\n1. Remote is too basic. It was good for MI Box but not good for TV. TV needs much more control. Not suggested for non tech savvy people.\n2. Setting is too basic too, can't control picture quality customisation, only 7 pre set picture mode present.\n3. Picture modes can't be changed when video running on Android app so no preview available. If video run through HDMI then you can change picture mode with preview.\n4. Now the most disappointing part, HDR 10 videos became more dull than normal video. Its a HDR 10 TV but when running HDR 4k video quality colours washed out. Its really un expected from this TV. I hope MI will provide some solutions with future software updates. Normal 4K videos r good but not HDR.\n5. Installation guy took over amount for movable wall-mount installation. Took 1800/- but when I call MI official they told it should cost 1200/-",

TV installation was quick and scheduled very next day of delivery.\nThere is no optical output port given in this TV, which is very big disappointment. Also only TV power cable comes with this TV. No other cables or wall mount bracket is supplied in the box. TV Remote comes without battery (keep 2 nos. AAA battery ready with you before installation guy comes at your doorstep) . Mi tried to cut every single penny they could save.\nThere is nothing very fantastic about this TV, which could give edge over other brands, but Overall this TV looks good deal for me.\nAlso buying 3yr TV protection will ensure which-ever brand you choose, will survive for at least next 3 years.\nI dont think brand name matters these days.

            "Price wise definitely a great purchase as for other brands you have to spend extra 5-10 k. Picture quality is good but not that great as like top 4K tv brands. Sound is good. If this is your first 4K tv then go for it. User interface of patchwall is easy to navigate. Time lag to start apps/swich windows is there. My other tv of LG is definitely far better than this but as a secondary tv this is good. Don't forget to but MI IR cable to operate set top box using mi tv remote. If your are looking for best picture quality, best sound etc then LG/Sony should be in your mind. I would still recommend this tv due to overall price and performance.",

Sound is good but connect with a sound bar to get cinematic experience. Remote is basic with dedicated Netflix and Prime video buttons. Viewing angles are ok but when you watch the tv from sitting on ground or lying over couch you will notice that the black is not true black.\n\nThe only pain after buying this tv is accessing the ports. You cant reach the ports if you did the wall mount. Hdmi ARC sometimes work other Times it wont. So I tried to connect my sound bar through optical cable but that port is not at all accessible, so I connected sound bar to Set up box. Sound modes are preset no much change you can notice even with tuning those. Written as TruHD and Dolby sound compatible but it sounds like some normal speakers. Over all a budget tv for those who wants a large screen in their house.\n\nIf you are looking for a large screen tv that too with low budget go for it.",

            "Well, if you just want to watch TV then go for it, otherwise please stay with me!\n\n1. That WiFi disconnection problem is still exists. It's rare but it's there. For a smooth experiance, I will suggest to use ethernet if your parents uses the TV.\n\n2. Viewing angle is very poor. I mean you can see everything from a wider angle but the colors will fade after 25-30' angle.\n\n3. Well the Fake HDR10. I tried Netflix and some PS4 games over this TV everything looks muddy and scattered. Compared to any HDR10 monitor / TVs like Sony or Samsung. Like the diff is hell n haven. The most important thing is to use HDR you need some serious digging for this TV. You need to turn on HDMI2.0 to use HDR from external devices and this option is not under the regular settings. After switching to your desired HDMI port you need to long press the select button on your TV remote and its there under display settings.\n\n4. Bluetooth disconnection is a problem too. If you connect a bluetooth speaker / soundbar the TV occasionally switches its sound output to inbuilt speakers and you can't switch it back to your bluetooth device cuz there is no option to connect/select. You need to unpair and re-pair your device to use it again. Sometimes restarting the TV also solves the problem.\n\n5. Also if you connect a bluetooth audio device you can't play HDR content from the apps. It switches to SDR.\n\n6. You may like it but personally hate Patchwall. Its unnecessary and complicate things for my parents.\n\nAfter all this I still want to give it a 3 star cuz the price of this TV is very low, otherwise it's a 2 star TV. I bought it for my home but I would never buy it again for my personal use.",

After receiving the tv(OnePlus) I was disappointed too much because it's like they're just take the panel and fix it by glue. Also the built quality was so poor. There was a huge gap between frame and screen.\nPicture quality was not good and also sound quality. So i returned it.\nAnd that's it I bought Mi tv 4x. Trust me it is just worthy.\nFrom picture quality to sound quality everything is very good at this price range.\nNow I'm Fully satisfied. Also there is a no network issue at all.\nLot's of people complained about network issue but in my piece it's okay there is no problem regarding network.\nAlso Tv installation done smoothly.\nSo if you confused between OnePlus and Mi tv\nI'm suggesting you that go for Mi tv blindly.",

However delivery I got delivery on 19th August. Without any reason the order delayed by 2 days.\nAlso t installation was scheduled on 19th August itself but same thing happened. Installation postponed to 20th August. I got sms in morning for installation with contact number of service engineer. When I tried to reach him there was no response. After some time he call me back and said that he will come at 3pm but he didn't come even after 5pm so I called customer care and then they have managed to do installation at 9pm today. But the guy was very rude and in hurry. He left without full demo and my TATA Sky was not working due to poor Singal so he took 200 rupees extra for just touching dish antenna. This is worst experience with flipkart after sales service.",
            "User friendly delivery. Sound Quality is not as expected. MI should update the OS appropriately to solve some ChromeCast, Mirroring, connectivity problems.",
            "Nice",
            "Picture quality is very good.worth of money.thank u Flipkart",
            "Picture & video quality was mind blowing.",
            "Most detailed review\n\n--- A could not be better product at the price point for sure ---\n\nIts an LCD pannel with LED backlight and hence it's heavy on power consumption, 105W, which is pretty high for day to day use of a TV. One should try to get a TV with LED pannel in order to stay energy and bill concious. Picture quality is unquestionable. Plays 4K videos like a charm and seamlessly, if your internet is fast enough of course. Sound is decent, not something worth a special mention. No bass at all, neither expected. WiFi connectivity range for this device is just as good as modern day mobile phones, compared to even normal laptops the WiFi connectivity range is much worse. Bluetooth connectivity range is just as normal. I have experienced few small lags, not too frequently. One bug is that while operating with voice command sometimes the TV sound stops to work completely and that is truly annoying. You will have to restart the TV to get going again. Slowness in operation while working with Google assistant is quite noticeable, and not because of internet speed.\n\nOS, UI & user-friendlyness:\n\nMi Patchwall home screen looks charming but I wish it could be more useful like when it comes to switching between apps there should be a button available on the remote to toggle between all running apps at the time like the case in Android smartphones. But truly thats a feature missing in the OS not in this specific TV or Patchwall. Also the recently viewed items section could be very helpful if not for the fact that it does not bring recent items from all the apps, like in my case it only shows the items watched in Hotstar. Also some apps take much longer to load than others like Hotstar is superfast where as Prime Video takes a while. Google assistant and voice search are useful, differently with different apps. Like with YouTube you will not be needing a keyboard ever, the voice search is ok there but with other apps, you can open the app with voice command, but not really search anything within it using voice search. And it's quite silly and weird if you have to type with a remote. This last point need no concern if everytime you cast content from your phone. Built in Chromecast is just awesome. Also using Miracast you\ncan clone you smartphone's screen on the TV which provides great flexibility.\n\nVerdict:\n\nIf you are excited with the concept of Android TV(my case exactly) and on a tight budget also looking for experiencing true 4K, then this the product for you. The trade off is in terns of energy inefficiency and small lags here and there. If your looking for uncompromised quality and performance, well do more research.\n\n! Most important suggestion !\n\nFor on-wall installation do not go for installation by Flipkart/Jeevs. Their service person is less than useless and they charge 500 for the wall bracket which is available online at cheaper price also the quality is better there. Just go for a tabletop installation when Flipkart installation team approaches you and afterward mount it on wall yourself or get help from local electrician. Much better option in my opinion.",

The delivery guy simply said that I have to purchase a new mount from him and he'll not fix the tv on the existing mount. This is weird since Flipkart says that the TV comes with free installation.\n\nAfter i told him to take his stuff and go back, he called his supervisor and agreed to mount the TV on existing mount. he told me that he can't take the guarantee if the tv falls (which is fine since he didn't installed the old mount) but the simple overselling and push form the delivery guy made the whole unboxing and first run experience dull for me.\n\nIf you're not bothered by it, then go ahead... its an awesome product.",

Picture quality is brilliant for the price\n2. Easy to use\n3. Connectivity is good: As people have called out, yes there were initially issues with wifi disconnecting but it gets resolved once you switch to Developer mode (Youtube it!). It's very easy to resolve\n4. Netflix, Prime, Hotstar, YouTube, Spotify, TVF Play, Voot, Zee5 work smoothly (Didn't try, nor ever trying ALT Balaji)\n\nCons:\n1. Volume control is not very good. You have to keep the remote handy if you're watching an action movie to switch between action and dialogue heavy sequences\n2. Mute button would be a great help\n3. In-built media players do not support subtitles if you're playing a media file through hard disk. You can download VLC or Mx Player but those apps are pretty buggy. They serve the makeshift purpose though\n4. Bit of an issue with Chromecast connectivity\n\nAll in all, I would highly recommend this as a bedroom TV or if you have a smaller living room.",

Played 1280x544 resolution movie by pendrive which also gives more than what was expected. 4k is also excellent and gives crystal clear viewing experience. Overall, if video has 480p or above resolution, then it is going to be a good experience.\n\nSound quality is ok. Bass is medium. Sound level is good enough for 400 sq ft room.\n\nWith connectivity, there is one issue (not a major one), you can plug 2 pendrive simultaneously only if pendrive is slim like traditional sandisk or hp pendrive which comes in metal. It is due to the place of port is at same site.\n\n\u274e\u274e\u274e Do not open tv yourself after delivery otherwise tv warranty will be void. Only authorised installation person can open it.\n\nPatchwall is good. Navigation is smooth in 95 percent cases. Other issue is with chromecast. You can play youtube, google photos etc easily if your phone is compatible. If your phone supports miracast or mirrorshare then it is going to a problem but it can be removed with the help of some other apps (go to youtube). Now it is all ok with new update.\n\nBuilt quality is good. Main plug wire has enough length. Looks good. Bezzels is ok. Remote is smaller which is good but it has no youtube button.\n\n\n\nOverall, i think it is a tv with 4.5 out of 5 star. Go for it.",

            "Most probably, the MI TV 4X 43 inch is having VA Panel. There is no way to find out whether it is IPS/VA, at least from the Menu. The display is very good, except for the light bleeding in complete dark area or scene. This will not affect your viewing experience. User interface especially menu is a bit tricky. One useful feature is it remembers the last input source. So if you are watching TATASKY-->Switch off --> Switch On -- The source last played will be selected by default. HDMI ARC is working fine, but getting the ARC through the Yamaha Receiver (HTR3067) was a herculean task. Android TV is good. Prime Video starts and plays without any hiccup from the Remote. I have got it on the first day sale for Rs.24000/- (ICICI BANK OFFER). The TV is total value for the money. Esp 4K HDR 43 inch display at this price with reasonably good build quality is excellent. Reduced one star because of the basic remote (No mute button). If you switch off from Remote, the TV shuts down (No standby) and restarts from the scratch if you switch on again. I heard that the you can take it to standby mode through voice command, yet to test that part.\n\nBut very important feature is Google-chrome cast but in MI 4x-pro it not comes with the product it self .

The extra money was paid for a flexible wall mount - Around 4K, but if you are thinking why so costly then think of the convenience too. The remote is a straight copy of the prime stick with extra features. It has a voice assistance button, 1 netflix and 1 prime hot keys. Chromecast works without a hitch and i connected my Raspberry pi via the HDMI and turned the TV into a giant monitor for coding. The possibilities are endless.
