Seller and Flipkart have cleverly hidden it while you see the product on the app unless you go deeper and check the product description. Usually who does that! Above all when I highlighted this issue and even showed my willingness to pay whatever the amount is to replace it with a better tv, Flipkart didn\u2019t support at all. This is the point one needs to be cautious as \u201cpolicy\u201d comes in the argument. So guys this is a lesson for every purchase you do on Flipkart.",

            "Superfast one day delivery and installation by flipkart and Jeeves.\nFeedback of 42\" FHD Tv after using 4 days.\n\nPros\n1. Superb picture quality and brightness 450 nits, I have to dim a little bit\n2. Dual band wifi 2.4 Ghz and 5Ghz, good for high speed connections\n3. Multiple connectors, 3 HDMi, Optical ,2 USB, Av etc\n4. The remote is versatile, even able to operate my fire tv stick with it\n5. IPS panel in this price is value for money\n6. Bezeless design\n7. Screen cast from Android and iOS device\n7. Clear sound\n\nCons.\n1. 40 W Sound is loud but not as expected from Blaupunkt, DTS/Dolby support is not there. Deducting one star because of it. I have purchased it mainly due to sound\n\nOverall very nice picture quality tv with loud sound",
            "After 15 days of usage....\nThe picture clarity is so so but not great. Too much of brightness even though backlight is 0%. The picture modes are not that much helpful. Sound is good when kept more than 50% else it is like 10 watts output below 50%. Remote is operating well since Bluetooth enabled. Actually wanted to try Nokia but at last moment decided to go for this bcoz Made in India product. Continueou watching causes eye irritations due to excess brightness and also viewing angles are not that much great. Overall just say it is OK product but not Great value for money.... someone can try Nokia or Iffalcon in the same price segment....",

            "Overall a decent product. Review after 3 days of usage. Checked all the hardware and software related stuff and everything is fine. The TV and the features provided are good, but it requires improvements in all the aspects video and audio quality. One point to add is the display changes after the android system update. Don't panic pls call the Blaupunkt CC for the display adjustments. The images given are 1080p pictures and are pretty good. HDR is noticeable but requires tuning.Overall a good TV.",
            "Very good smart TV at a very good price with fabulous sounds",
            "The delivery and support staff was really good. The picture quality is pretty good. And the sound quality is the best in the range. I trusted the German engineering and hope that it pays off. Happy to have bought the product and I recommend it for the quality in budget price.",
            "Super product in reasonable amount.Delivery super but asking tip and installation person also asking money and taken.i am not satisfied about installation person.So guys TV is super don't believe other.Thank u flipkart",
            "After a lot of searching, I chose BLAUPUNKT TV. I am very HAPPY and SATISFIED. The TV and remote are very easy to use. Also BETTER picture clarity. Good audio clarity. There is so much happiness. Thanks BLAUPUNKT.",
            "The TV is really good & Loved the sound of 40W Speakers.\nWorth the money & Highly recommended this product.\nThank you flipkart for the quick delivery.\nVery thankful to the installation team for this much responsible. And above all, Blaupunkt is really Rocking.. \u2764\ud83d\ude0d",
            "Bought this TV during the sale and was very satisfied with the product and the service provided. Delivery was on time. Installation was done on time. Blaupunkt support contacted and helped with the installation.\n\nProduct Review:\nAmazing sound output. Clarity really good.",
            "This is a good buy in this price range. Perfect picture quality and sound i.n This price segment. But beware don't update tv. Some review suggesting not to do so. However I haven't done it yet, so can't explain anything further. In short this is good buy. Better than other brand.",
            "It's too early to review as I used it for just 10 days as of now. Overall it seems to be good. It has more audio sound of 40w, but quality of the sound is normal. My review is a layman's review as still I don't have much knowledge of using android systems. The 'Blaupunkt' brand name has very good recognition all over the world in the field of audio systems. It is considered as one of the luxurious brand. I choose to buy this TV only because of it's brand name. and it is German brand, not Chinese. But, as now their these Smart LED TVs are manufactured in India, I am not sure of the quality. But, I strongly believe that they will never compromise on the quality of the product. If they maintain the quality it's good for both manufacturer and customer.\n\nIt is good for those who wants to buy budget smart LED TV. Overall it is value for money.",
            "Picture quality is pretty good ...\n2ndly its nt dolby\nThere is a blue indicator always ON..looks odd..\nIt is same as KODAK and Thomson.... I think realme and MI is better worth than this .....in 15k....remote quality is very poor...i gt defective product but flipkart have made the replacement....Thanks flipkart..",
            "The led tv with worst sound ever heard, it's like torn sound without any bass, like the sound which comes from assembled computer (pcs) in year 2000.\nTv advertisement is misleading, it says surrounding sound 40watt sound output, all things false,\nThis tv only suitable for cctv footage application",
            "Installation was fine but took 4 days. Have used it for just 5 days, the product seems fine so far. Sound is fine not great as expected from Blaupunkt, maybe tweaking the equalizer will improve the quality, especially the base. Netflix doesn't work out of the box nor can it be installed from playstore but can be downloaded separately and installed from usb and run using sideload but navigation in Netflix doesn't work alright. Neither can chrome browser or Firefox be installed from the store, has some other web browsers but I haven't experimented with them. Has good support for connectors - input output. Good value for money overall compared to the rest in the budget segment. Have taken the extended warranty +2 yrs for 1099 plus shall be receiving 3 months additional warranty from the supplier so overall 3y 3m warranty is being expected, I hope the service is fine. The os/shell seems to be same as Thomson, Kodak.\n\nSpecs as shown in device details:\nModel: PATH_7XPRO\nVersion: 9\nAndroid security patch level: 5 May 2021\nKernel version: 4.9.113\nBuild: PI.20210601 release-keys",
            "Best buy at this price. obviously this TV can't be compared with TV leaders(Samsung & LG). Picture quality need improvement as it has more brighter resolution even with 0% backlight settings. Sound is quite high but quality need improvement. No Dolby sound.",

            "The delivery as indicated, installation got completed next day. The clarity of the picture is nice compared to other smart tv's of same size and cost sound output was good and owsome",
            "It's a very nice TV, with great sound. My child loves it so much. Thank you Blaupunkt, Flipkart and the delivery partner.",
            "Good purchase in this price range. Bought it for my father (senior citizen) and it is serving its purpose pretty well. Hope, like other products of Blaupunkt it will last for long time period as well. Also, specially like to mention that installation was quite smooth in a non-metro.",

            "If this review helps you, put a thumbs up for others to see.\nPicture quality when viewed from the center is awesome, but if viewed from the sides, the colors are washed up.\nNetflix isn't supported, even sideloading won't work. I had purchased firestick for it.\n40W speaker is treble rich. The bass is lacking for most of the time. You need external speaker for them to feel.\nWall mount is simple.\nThis tv is the same as kodak, thomson, even the name is same. Its just the sticker of Blaupunkt.\nIf you plug in usb pendrive, the wifi goes off for some reason.",
            "Never buy this product. It\u2019s just a trap to attract people. Waste of time.waste of money.\n\nIssue:\nThe display will completely blurred after updating software.",
            "Only thing that is German is the name, other than that this is a cheap TV from the same manufacturer that manufacturers kodak tv. The specs are the same except for 40w speaker. The speakers are loud but the quality of sound is average at best. On their website they have an image of apps that includes Netflix. Netflix does not come preloaded and search on playstore does not bring . Netflix is not supported. Their claims are misleading. Flipkart customer support call got disconnected midway twice. I called Blaupunkt india directly to open a ticket. The person took the call and promised a call back. No ticket number was given, apparently their systems do not generate tickets for customer complaints. There was no call back even after a week.",

Keeping the price in mind even build quality is respectable. We haven't faced any difficulties and installation is smooth.\nNetflix not working is a bummer, but it's fine for our usage.\n\nI am giving 4 start because the practice of asking a review for a incentive seems scamy",

            "Everything was on time, including the installation.\nThe delivery agent came, opened the box, showed us the main item and accessories and went away.\nNextday, the installation engineer came and installed.\n\nImmediately after receipt, the TV was put to use\nby putting it on the table easily using the two plastic support clips. Power cable was connected to the mains, and wifi password was given. Immediately, Android software with a size of 638 mb was installed. It took about half an hour. Although the 2x20 watt speakers are good, I preferred to connect my tower speaker with 6.5 \"\nSubwoofer to the TV. The pairing of bt speaker was very good and the bt connectivity is excellent.\nTwo full movies were seen for six hours, no lag was noticed at all. I do not have any dish tv connection\nor cable TV connection. I am using it as smart TV only. The performance is very good for 32 inch TV HD viewing is fine. But now I am of the opinion Blaupunkt should have thought of making this a full HD TV. Overall, a good 32\" inch Smart TV from Blaupunkt.\nA",

I must say this is one of the best decisions that I have made so far in choosing an electronic device.\n\nPicture Quality: 5/5 mind you it's a full hd tv and not 4K\n\nSound Quality: 5/5 this is the best sound in any tv at this price point or even in tv's of much higher segments than this.\n\nColour: 5/5 the colour looks very close to natural\n\nConnectivity: 5/5 it offers you large number of connectivity options as mentioned in the specifications without any issues( I have tested all of them)\n\nInbuilt Apps: 4/5 as it doesn't offer Netflix and you can't download it from the the Playstore either.\n\nOverall, I can say that it's a German quality you can trust, though it is purely made in India product (not just assembled)",

It has ARC HDMI sound support for greater sound.\n\nWhen I tried to play some videos, the TV was not supporting that format in terms of audio. So we can instal VLC or any other major players in the TV as it's an Android TV and we can easily play those videos with those apps.\n\nI connected my amplifier with this TV and it worked great. Very easy wifi setup and connectivity.\n\nIf you are looking for pixel to pixel review you can see micro seconds delay in terms of playing videos from youtube through Chromecast. But you won't notice this if you don't watch it closely. I checked this because I have a separate Chromecast device for my previous TV.\n\nOnly downside I feel is that, it only has 1 year Warranty. If we can get extended warranty for 3 years then that would be a game changer.\n\nThanks Flipkart for this wonderful product.",
