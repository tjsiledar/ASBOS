This information is not shared anywhere by Samsung including it's official website and support team also does not know it. Very few apps are available to download which can be counted in your single hand itself. Hardware is great but the speaker does not justify the money we spend for this TV.",

Speaker volume is low.bezels are very low.rest plastic quality of tv is average. Remote comes with Bluetooth. Remote is very nice and looks awesome. OS is little laggy. Samsung store have very little apps.",
            "I first booked a realme tv and then replaced it then refunded it\nI was really disappointed . So i bought samsung and i will tell you spending 10 k more is worth it\nThe picture quality is awesome\nNo money charged for wall mount\nDeep blacks are displayed\nYou must buy it if you have 38 k go for the 43 inch version instead of 50+ variant in some other brand\nSound is okay because i installed it in my bedroom\nOtherwise you might need to set sound at 80+\nNo screen bleeding issue also !!\nWhich is present in almost all chinese tvs\nI am satisfied with this product",
            "Excellent product with excellent flipkart on time delivery with excellent before time installation.\nI am a plus member of flipkart and I purchase everything with such a good and trusted platform. They commit the originality of product with on time delivery which is really true.\nAnd as far as Samsung Uhd 4k pro is concern it is really a very good product with all the smart tv features. Excellent picture and sound quality.",
            "Picture Quality : Awesome\nSound clarity : Good\nLoudness of sound : Very average\nConnectivity : Great\nOverall extremely satisfied... Great product... Can be recommended to anyone..\n\nSpecial Mention : Not at all happy with the installation guy. That fellow was very incompetent and was neither able to install it properly on the wall nor able to explain the features. However, I had to give my inputs using common sense to wall mount it and eventually after using it sometime understood the features..",
            "The TV is great. The picture quality is fantastic. As being a samsung product I believe it can last longer than some other low cost brands out in the market.\nBut the only let down was in the software. The app support in Tizen os is not good. Prime video and Netflix will work just fine. But 4k streaming is restricted in many other apps like hotstar, jio cinema, Sony LIV etc. Which is really big problem. Hope Tizen os will rectify this in future.",
            "One of the best Premium Budget TV from Premium Brands.\nPicture quality is Awesome.\n\nSound Quality is good but if you like Audio to be bit high go for sound bar. I am Using Boat Avante 2000 along with this TV.\n\n3 HDMi (1 eArc) is very useful and gives you good picture and sound quality.\n\nRemote quality is good. If everything is connected through HDMI, This remote can operate all devices.\n\nAlexa (in Hindi) seems still not available. Hope to get it in future updates.\n\nThere is no need to say anything about there Delivery and Installation. Both were very quick and on-time. Thank you so much Flipkart for the support provided.\n\nI am reviewing this after using it for 3 days. I will be updating this review after using it for a month.",
            "Super product just go for it. Very good quality and connectivity i am loving it. This is my second tv. My first tv was also samsung 55inch purchased in 2014 still doing well.\n\nThere is technically very advanced features in this crystal 58inch model. Justgo for it.",
            "I ordered on may 21st night they delivered on may 23rd very quick delivery thank you flipcart and also that delivery man.\nPicture - 5/5 support 4k video\nSound - 5/4 support full formet except dts\nConnectivity - 5/4 Hdmi 3port - USB 1port\nCost - 5/5",
            "I didn't like the tv when it arrived because it lake some features from last generation like ambient mode, but it's budget tv so it didn't need that the main purpose is to save money and after all tis just couple of features that looks cool we will use for just 2 weeks and after that we'll forget about that.\nPicture quality is good 4k upscaling is very good sound quality is average overall nice product but only drawback is very less app available it would be better to buy android box with it",
            "There is a price to pay for the very attractive price tag.\nBeen using a samsung 43\u201d smart 4k since last 4 years, bought offline, and to this day, the operating system of that tv and remote functionality are way better and smoother as compared to this new unit.\nIts OS is laggy, remote is a hit and miss, remote build quality is really cheap and flimsy. Picture quality is standard 4k and pretty good at it, but the really frequent software glitches sour the entire experience of using it. Better t...\nREAD MORE",
            "Picture quality is really good at this price point, I have taken the 58\u201d model and it just changed my living area for its beauty. Sound of this tv is 20watt but I must say sound quality is top notch, clear and well balanced. I am really happy with the tv till now, using this tv since last 10 days.",
            "If u guys looking for a good quality tv with good quality picture it will be a good choice,and its sound quality is beyond average,you can call it decent quality,and it's sound is quite perfect for 120-144 sq room.\nI'm happy with my TV.",
            "Excellent picture quality and 4k upscaling of the processor is wonderful. Easy user-friendly interface.\nOnly drawback found for fewdays of usage is discovery+ is not available among popular OTT apps.\n\nOverall excellent buy. Value for money",

            "Picture quality is very good. ( Not recommended for very bright light room)\nTV is easy to handle.\nTv sounds is enough for small room. But if u add Samsung soundbar+ subwoofer, it will give u thetre like feeling.\n\nIssue :- 1) brightness in bright room.\n2) Only 2 GB available for installation of new app.\n3) it's not android so limited app.",
            "Picture and sound quality is amazing.\nPerformance is not good you can feel the UI lagging every time.\nApp support is also not that good. Zee5 is the worst app. There are no animations and takes half to one second to respond.\nIf you want a TV just for the picture quality and good sound go for it.\nI got it for my PS5 and the only thing I needed was a good display and speakers.",
            "Samsung is the best in TV's, picture quality is awesome, best part is service, installation done in same day on time, thanks to flipkart and Samsung !\nOne thing there many low price brands available with cheap n low quality Chinese products, i got a very bad experience from Realme, bought a 43\" led tv and the panel dead in 9 months (low usage), they sell it with 2year panel replacement warranty, but in my case it didn't work, service and after sale response is so pathetic, so spend some more money and go for a branded with good service.",
            "Amazing product with almost bezel less design, great display but slight issues with viewing angles.\n\nSound output (20w) is good for small room and might not be sufficient for larger room size, need a sound bar to enhance the experience.\n\nConnectivty is good, no lag issues. Tizen OS is user friendly and it works great on most of the occasions.\n\nFlipkart deliver service is trustworthy, the unit was delivered to me couple of days before the expected date and the installation is done with in 48 hours of product delivery.\n\nThank u Flipkart...!",

            "Really value for money 4K TV. Absolutely minimal bezel\u2026looks premium.. personally for me sound is great as my room is small. Picture quality is just mind blowing\u2026using with PS5..HDR works fantastic.. Delivery was very efficient and installation was completed by Samsung within the next hour after delivery. Very happy about the efficiency of delivery and installation",

            "Very good TV for the money.\n\nPicture Quality is excellent for the price range. Very good level of brightness and contrast. Colors are also very good. 4K videos are really 'Crystal' clear.\n\nSound is not bad for a mid size room. Room in which I placed TV is around 154 sq.ft. Also, sound has decent base. I was expecting a very mediocre sound quality from the reviews I have seen. But I'm more than satisfied after experiencing it.\n\nConnectivity is very good. Its getting connected to wifi networks almost instantly. But once your modem gets off and turns back on, then you may have to go back to network settings and connect manually. Its only 2 days since I'm using it. May be there are some other better ways to connect. Let me see. I'm using Airtel connection. Its playing videos without any buffering issues.\n\nMobile casting is also working fine. Once connected, its playing everything smoothly. A small lag of less than 1 second is observed while mobile screen is cast on tv. But the lag is not for sound alone. Its for the video too. So there will not be any lip sync issue.\n\nIts playing .avi, .mp4, .mkv, .webm formats. I have not tried any formats other than these so far.\n\nUpscaling of HD contents to 4k is working nicely. Videos are playing smoothly. I have visited many electronic shops here and observed some other 4K TVs of same 43 inch screen size playing Full HD videos at less than full HD clarity and that too with some ghost like flow.. I feel it's very unwise idea to buy cheaper TVs merely going by the specifications they mention. Don't fall for the words like Dolby vision, HDR 10 etc. What's all these gimmicks after all, if the difference is not visible on the screen. May be you can get a mental satisfaction that you are watching 'Dolby vision'. If you doubt me go to a nearby electronic shop and see the difference for yourself.\n\nIn my opinion, this TV is a very good choice in the budget segment. And guys, even if you are not satisfied with the sound, you can always buy a sound bar anytime later. But what if the screen is not good enough. There is nothing you can do about it later than to regret. Trust me the sound quality is not so bad the you'll need to buy a sound bar immediately. And the fact that this is not an Android TV has not disappointed me. Tizen is good enough for me.\n\nOne last word, please go for this pro version as it has voice assistant. You can dictate what you want to search. Its very difficult to type using the remote. So I think voice assistant is a must feature. Don't mind the price difference of around 2000 for this 'crystal 4k pro' version with normal 'crystal 4k'. Its worth paying extra. And buy a stabiliser for long life of your TV.",
            "Bixby voice support isn't supporting well....it doesn't respond sometimes...Had spend 2000 etc for voice search and inbuilt voice search is not responding properly that's one of the drawback I experienced from this TV...\nPicture clarity don't have to comment it's samsung so it's the best.... Internet connectivity as well is good....\nRegarding sound without a soundbar this TV we can't enjoy much! So will suggest to purchase a soundbar if you are expecting sound performance!\n\nInstallation the executive who came wasn't professional...he was very careless while installing the TV and he was doing it in a hurry that made me crazy.... Installation should be smooth....",
