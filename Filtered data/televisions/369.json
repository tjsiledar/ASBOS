            "I'm reviewing after 5-7 days\nPros:\nPicture quality is superb as compared to other 4k TVs\nMobile casting is lag free\nGood connectivity like pc on TV\nBeezle is to less and appears good\nBluetooth song playing interface is good\nRequired major apps and features are provided\nWall mount is good as compared to other tvs\nBoth sound bar and TV speakers work simultaneously\nCons:\nIf you are a sound lover I prefer you to purchase a sound bar coz low sound\nNot all apps are available\nSome lag in interface while in home usually occurs in all tvs\nOverall summary:\nIf you require a good picture quality and good mobile casting you can go with this blindly but requires a sound bar if u need high sound",
            "1. Sound is average, may require soundbar for theatrical experience.\n2. Apps like MX player, Discovery+, epic are not available. App store not much rich in number.\n3. Picture quality and contrast outstanding ( blacks are like real black) but Viewing angle average, as It's not IPS panel (I think)\n4. Software is Breeze\n5. Installation excellent.\n6. Bazels are slim looks are beauty, will give heart burn to others\n7. Remote is Excellent, sound buttons are like joystick \ud83d\udd79\ufe0f\n8. Overall i'Il recommend it to buy. (Price is Reasonable)",
            "Samsung does not share it that this TV has just 4GB of storage and 1GB of RAM this makes it not worthy of money. This information is not shared anywhere by Samsung including it's official website and support team also does not know it. Very few apps are available to download which can be counted in your single hand itself. Hardware is great but the speaker does not justify the money we spend for this TV.",

            "It's best tv for price range and it doesn't have aux options and it's not android TV...can't install new apps...or small games ... and its remote is smart but small and keys are hard to get adjusted 43 inc tv is good for 17 x 10 hall of home",
            "Picture quality is too good, sound level is not so good but ok. Value for money, always better than cheaper brand...",
            "Picture Quality is Awesome but sound is not enough because it having only 20w speakers if you\u2019re okay to use separate sound bar this is perfect tv.",

            "I'm reviewing after 5-7 days\nPros:\nPicture quality is superb as compared to other 4k TVs\nMobile casting is lag free\nGood connectivity like pc on TV\nBeezle is to less and appears good\nBluetooth song playing interface is good\nRequired major apps and features are provided\nWall mount is good as compared to other tvs\nBoth sound bar and TV speakers work simultaneously\nCons:\nIf you are a sound lover I prefer you to purchase a sound bar coz low sound\nNot all apps are available\nSome lag in interface while in home usually occurs in all tvs\nOverall summary:\nIf you require a good picture quality and good mobile casting you can go with this blindly but requires a sound bar if u need high sound",
            "1. Sound is average, may require soundbar for theatrical experience.\n2. Apps like MX player, Discovery+, epic are not available. App store not much rich in number.\n3. Picture quality and contrast outstanding ( blacks are like real black) but Viewing angle average, as It's not IPS panel (I think)\n4. Software is Breeze\n5. Installation excellent.\n6. Bazels are slim looks are beauty, will give heart burn to others\n7. Remote is Excellent, sound buttons are like joystick \ud83d\udd79\ufe0f\n8. Overall i'Il recommend it to buy. (Price is Reasonable)",
            "Samsung does not share it that this TV has just 4GB of storage and 1GB of RAM this makes it not worthy of money. This information is not shared anywhere by Samsung including it's official website and support team also does not know it. Very few apps are available to download which can be counted in your single hand itself. Hardware is great but the speaker does not justify the money we spend for this TV.",

            "The TV is great. The picture quality is fantastic. As being a samsung product I believe it can last longer than some other low cost brands out in the market.\nBut the only let down was in the software. The app support in Tizen os is not good. Prime video and Netflix will work just fine. But 4k streaming is restricted in many other apps like hotstar, jio cinema, Sony LIV etc. Which is really big problem. Hope Tizen os will rectify this in future.",

            "Very good TV for the money.\n\nPicture Quality is excellent for the price range. Very good level of brightness and contrast. Colors are also very good. 4K videos are really 'Crystal' clear.\n\nSound is not bad for a mid size room. Room in which I placed TV is around 154 sq.ft. Also, sound has decent base. I was expecting a very mediocre sound quality from the reviews I have seen. But I'm more than satisfied after experiencing it.\n\nConnectivity is very good. Its getting connected to wifi networks almost instantly. But once your modem gets off and turns back on, then you may have to go back to network settings and connect manually. Its only 2 days since I'm using it. May be there are some other better ways to connect. Let me see. I'm using Airtel connection. Its playing videos without any buffering issues.\n\nMobile casting is also working fine. Once connected, its playing everything smoothly. A small lag of less than 1 second is observed while mobile screen is cast on tv. But the lag is not for sound alone. Its for the video too. So there will not be any lip sync issue.\n\nIts playing .avi, .mp4, .mkv, .webm formats. I have not tried any formats other than these so far.\n\nUpscaling of HD contents to 4k is working nicely. Videos are playing smoothly. I have visited many electronic shops here and observed some other 4K TVs of same 43 inch screen size playing Full HD videos at less than full HD clarity and that too with some ghost like flow.. I feel it's very unwise idea to buy cheaper TVs merely going by the specifications they mention. Don't fall for the words like Dolby vision, HDR 10 etc. What's all these gimmicks after all, if the difference is not visible on the screen. May be you can get a mental satisfaction that you are watching 'Dolby vision'. If you doubt me go to a nearby electronic shop and see the difference for yourself.\n\nIn my opinion, this TV is a very good choice in the budget segment. And guys, even if you are not satisfied with the sound, you can always buy a sound bar anytime later. But what if the screen is not good enough. There is nothing you can do about it later than to regret. Trust me the sound quality is not so bad the you'll need to buy a sound bar immediately. And the fact that this is not an Android TV has not disappointed me. Tizen is good enough for me.\n\nOne last word, please go for this pro version as it has voice assistant. You can dictate what you want to search. Its very difficult to type using the remote. So I think voice assistant is a must feature. Don't mind the price difference of around 2000 for this 'crystal 4k pro' version with normal 'crystal 4k'. Its worth paying extra. And buy a stabiliser for long life of your TV.",
            "Bixby voice support isn't supporting well....it doesn't respond sometimes...Had spend 2000 etc for voice search and inbuilt voice search is not responding properly that's one of the drawback I experienced from this TV...\nPicture clarity don't have to comment it's samsung so it's the best.... Internet connectivity as well is good....\nRegarding sound without a soundbar this TV we can't enjoy much! So will suggest to purchase a soundbar if you are expecting sound performance!\n\nInstallation the executive who came wasn't professional...he was very careless while installing the TV and he was doing it in a hurry that made me crazy.... Installation should be smooth....",
