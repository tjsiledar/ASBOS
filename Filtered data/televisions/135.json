            "I've been using it for almost a week here is my review of motorola revou qled 50 inch tv. The build of this Tv is very good it comes with metal stands which looks stylish and premium. the thin bezel design gives the tv futuristic looks The panel is VA dled with quantum filters which gives very beautiful picture quality it has enough briteness to view HDR contents the 60w speakers are awesome produce good sound output However the storage is very less around 7.3 gb of free space and the new android 11 is very heavy it's not optimised yet, sometimes it lags alot I hope they'll fix these bugs with an OTA update ... Any way for the price tag this is definitely a value for money and an awesome qled TV",
            "It is okay product but just after 10 days price reduce by 5K , which is really disgusting\nIt doesnot seem qled tv, it is normal led tv\nSound is not ao much effective as mentioned in description, it is just like good for nothing",
            "I am So Happy for this Deal Really Amazing QLED in this Range .\n\nPicture Quality Is Very Very Amazing And Sound is also Great \u263a\ufe0f\nOver All Value For money",
            "One of the best QLED TV at this price range with such a superb specifications. I t is really difficult to find such specifications at this price range.\n\nJEEVES service person is knowledgeable with soft spoken & explained all the features of TV & how to save guard TV from damages. I also purchased compleat warranty via. Him.\n\nThis review is just after 48 hrs of installation over all I am happy ,expecting similar services from JEEVES in future too.",
            "I've been using this TV for past two weeks now. Excellent QLED; The display is amazing and produces all colors with utmost clarity. This VA panel does not wash out the colors while viewing from sides. It has good viewing angle.\n\nTV when powered on in the morning takes 60 seconds to boot which is normal to any android TV. Once the TV is up everything works quick; Buttery smooth interface but the spotlight remote disconnects often. It reconnects without any hurdles but we often get notification \"Spotlight remote connected successfully\".\n\nSound quality is amazing; Quality crystal clear loud audio without any noise or distortion. Audio is excellent for movies (clear speech audio);\n\nDual band Wi-Fi ensures lag free 4k streaming;\n\nCons :\nThe bottom of the TV is thick to accommodate the large speakers; While wall mounting the TV lays little far from wall surface.",
            "TV is good picture quality is also good. Worth it QLED in this price range. But the only drawback is it does not have ARC or eARC hdmi port for the sound bar to connect. How to connect the soundbar now. My soundbar does not have optical slot.\nOverall quality and clarity is Good.",
            "Very good TV. Didn't disappoint at all. I was initially worried about the comparison of Motorola TV vs standard and well proven brands like Sony, Samsung and LG. Because one could see other brands in showrooms and feel the experience. But after going through feedback online and also hearing from a friend who had used Motorola TV I went ahead and purchased this 55\" inch TV. Its sleek yet Audio (Dolby) is very good. No need of Home theatre if you have this TV. Mainly display is good which is where our investment goes. HD channels it has to be - appear really great. When it comes to Smart TV - Apps work seamlessly. I have used Disney hotstar, SonyLIV, Prime, I feel like I am seeing TV - Such is the sync and streaming quality (provided you have good WiFi). It has good meeting features though i have not used because I have placed my TV in living room. I have not played heavy graphics games but basic games are good to play with wireless gamepad. I have used bluetooth headset so that i enjoy the visual experience of this big TV without disturbing others and it worked well. Casting from mobile also worked seamlessly.\n\nOverall i have not experienced any issue till now.\n\nIf Motorola had given FM , it would have been good.",
            "If you are reading this review then you should stop your search if the specifications are matching and the budget is fitting.\nGo ahead and finalize this, wonderful product topped with additional gaming capabilities.\nI will not provide the technical specs and other such things as its already detailed.\nI would simplify the complexities by saying just one sentence - it is a wonderful product built by Motorola and marketed by Flipkart, ticks all the checkpoint and performs well, in fact, perform far better than any other competitors.\n\nWhen I purchased it got a good credit card deal, delivery took around 4/5 days however wait was worth it.\nThe installation guy came the next day and did a fantastic job. He offered the extended warranty(he said either you can purchase it online while buying a tv or just one more time after the installation) However I was not needing it hence politely rejected but if you need it, you can go for the extended warranty.\n\nI am extremely happy with the purchase, had a lot of other options and brands while deciding, however, I went ahead with this choice and found solace \ud83d\ude0a",

            "Bought it as a replacement for my damaged Motorola ZX Pro 55\" TV.\nPicture quality is better than ZX Pro. Better than VU Premium TV also. Upscaling of SD content is excellent. Design isn't bezel-less. There's a thin bezel which protrudes out. Sound quality is acceptable.\n\nThere are following issues with the TV.\n\n1. Prime videos does not play UHD+HDR contents (Example: The Tomorrow War movie). It'll play normal content, HDR contents and UHD content, but not those videos which are both HDR and UHD.\n\n2. HotStar does not have an option to play 4k content at all.\n\n3. When connecting set top box (TataSky Binge box in my case) through HDMI cable and opting for HDMI 2.0 setting, sometimes the TV fails to detect the video and displays blank screen. This doesn't happen all the time though.\n\nI've seen a few people complain of some of the above issues online.\n\nMotorola support call centre was useless with regards to this issue\n\nPicture quality of this TV is excellent. However software doesn't seem to have been optimised.\n\nAll those of you, who are buying/bought this TV, I request you to check the above mentioned 2 issues. If you are also facing these issues, take it up with Flipkart/Motorola so that they'll release a patch to resolve these issues at the earliest.\n\nUpdate: HotStar is now offering 4k video option after the latest update of the app.",
            "This TV looks good with thin bezel and metal back. Picture and sound quality is awesome. I found the screen much brighter. The Installation service was good.

            "My review is after use of this product for 6 months, the picture quality is very good and sound is good. Application lags develop post 4th month, loading of TV gets delayed with time but net net very good product experience.\n\nRecently got issues with remote and power button was giving problem. Called the motorolla support team and realised there is a manual button behind the remote reader on TV which is hidden and not visible at first sight. There are no other manual buttons and thus dependency on remote is more.\n\nCompany should take immediate action to make the remote available as an out of shelf for any purchase, this is a major setback which everyone will face one or other day, also the pricing should be reasonable",
            "Value for money and sound quality is superb..",
            "The TV is super awesome, if you are looking for an advanced TV with superior picture quality, this is the one. I guess I got this on launch price which is way lower than current 50k mark.\nHave been using this TV for more than a month now. I am in love with this TV.\nLet me quickly share the pros and cons:\n1. Picture Quality: You will simply fall in love with the display. It's awesome. Switch on the smoothing from settings, and if you are switching from a normal led or LCD screen you will find how smooth the pic quality can be.\n1.2. Screen: Again it's beautiful, you can optimize more in additional settings. Yours kids spend more time on TV, there is eye-shield mode, it looks natural. No bad effect. The screen normally also felt good to me.\n2. Connectivity: it supports both 2.5 GHz & 5 GHz, and it's again super smooth.\n3. Game Remote Control: If you love gaming, then you will definitely love this. No lag in gaming, I tested Asphalt 8. It was smooth. If you never played with a game pad before, you might need to understand the controls first.\n4. Speakers: you will love the bass effects it perfectly produces while watching a movie. You might love listening to songs with special settings for music and movies.\n\nCons:\n1. Sound: It has good in-built Dolby speakers. Gives great bass. But sometimes it might not sound great. \ud83d\ude15. For example, switching between a movie and a news channel you might check sound settings. Or set it as standard if you do not want to change sound settings again and again. But that will lose the bass effect in movies and music.\n2. Remote: I think Remote could have better functionality. Faster control. Switching on takes time.\n\nAlso above two cons are not a deal breaker, coz I guess these can be fixed by software update. If you have additional sound bar, then you definitely don't need to worry about the sound.\n\nAdditionally I am using it with Jio TV, so you will feel smoothing difference between apps on Jio TV and normal TV apps like hotstar or prime.\n\nBut seriously watching cricket on big screen really feels a lot better.",
