Latest Android, 3 HDMI, Bluetooth 5 and wifi 6, what else does one need?\n4. Delivery way inconvenient due to being late and the delivery agent being rude but the installation person was Swift and installed the tv within minutes.\n\nCons:\n1. standby led is a bit too bright which is annoying in dark rooms, but this can easily by solved stick a white paper over the light using a transparent tape.\n2.
