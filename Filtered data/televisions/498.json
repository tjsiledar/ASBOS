            "Tv size is 28.4 inch in box it is mentioned 32 inch 81cms product is good , installation is not proper I am not going to raise complaint because I am happy with flip cart hereafter pls double check this is my request . I contacted one service engineer he asked me to measure the screen from top right corner to left bottom corner it is 32 inches . Sorry flip cart for my ignorance",
            "best tv Indian products are more better then China TV's so don't go for other.i apriceat flip kart on time delivery and only in one day installation thank you flip kart",
            "tv is nice but wifi connection is low and miracast conect no saport adio sound .net conect very slowly\npicture quality best super sound very good tv",
            "first of all, i trust the brand micromax as it was my first smartphone, now im also having another 32 inch tv..working fine for the past 2 years, as such i again buy another one last day.. today it got deliver, took only 2 days....super value for money..nice buy, excellent picture excellent internet connectivity, fully recomended to budjet tv lovers, hotstar connectivity has some issues. completely loved the tv ,considering to buy the next model from micromax. satisfied customer...will update if any issues happen.",
            "Though I did not hv entertaining its smart features like internet connection, and using basic features only.. but it looks good so far.",
            "All Things are good. Worth Of money .\nDue to Google play Services not available so Hotstar apk not working as well as Jio Tv",
            "This is very nice TV. Just wanted to say this is best Smart TV in terms of cost.\nScreen quality - Awesome.\nVolume - I can't raise more then 15/100 . Trust me guys if you will raise more then 50% your neighbors will shout on you. :)\nWifi connectivity.\nBit Slow in operating from remote control but you we can operate remote by your phone you will love it.\nMany app which you download from net will be compatible with this TV. (I meant you say you will not get error message)\n\nDelivery was on time.\nInstallation was on time.\nInstallation guy was very well behaved. (best thing was he said that \" If you face any difficulties you can call me and he gave his number\"). this was really convening me.\n\nThanks to flipkart.",
            "One thing I want to say, it is value for money. Connectivity is fine, mobile casting is OK. prime videos are running properly.\nBut the services is very poor, installation has taken approx one week and as per commitment, they should visit as per my convenient timing but no they came for installation after several complains and have't provided any demo as I was not available there.\nIf they have provided such a pathetic service for installation, imagine if I need service then what would happen!!\n\nEven Youtube video is not working properly, sometimes it works fine but sometimes it asks to update and then got hanged.",
            "Made good for the price. Do not expect a Bravia OLED, but a good tv for this price. Casting could be improved slightly as you cannot play videos streaming on the internet seamlessly from your phone. You have to download the video first to you phone and then mirror screen to play on the tv screen.",
            "Excellent 3 day delivery by flipkart and 1 day installation by micromax. Tv is good given the price in this segment. Aptoid is very similar as an appstore as android and contains all the required apps one needs for the tv. Overall a good value for money product by Micromax.",
            "Good TV with enhanced audio clarity and good connectivity and excellent file transfer",
            "Your web site is very good & nice\nalso service is too good\nproduct is fantastic superb very very good nice..",

            "It's a value for money product. At this price point nothing else is better than Micromax Canvas 3 TV. De livery and installation was also efficient and good. Overall very happy and satisfied with the TV and Flipkart.",
            "This smart t.v is worth your money ,you could find everything in this budget range.\nThe picture clarity is amazing.\nThe sound is astonishing.\nAnd The connectivity is fast.\nJust one problem,the delivery person didn't deliver at my home,he called me near my house and i have to it by myself.",
            "good product all in one led smart tv with this tv amazing",
            "This is a best TV in low budget. Awesome picture quality, sound quality. Smooth play youtube hota tar etc. I am happy",
            "I was purchased Micromax Canvas 3 led tv @12499 it is a very good picture quality like branded tv's. Sound amazing & connectivity should be better\nValue for money",
            "very good option at this price,\nwriting after 4 months use..\nvery good picture quality (use HD STB for best experience) , sound is very good, it has WiFi, hotspot, HDMI, Rgb, VGA, USB ports. Easy to use interference, software is good, you can install apps from app Store and manually too. screen cast works perfect, nice design.\nDelivery was on time, installation from jevees was also good and installation person was polite.\nbest at this price range, better than MI and Thomson.",
            "good for a budget TV but can't compare on standard of smart TVs..here are certain cons\n\n1. it doesn't play hd videos .it says though hd ready and should be able to play 720p videos but quality sucks and looks animated\n\n2. most of the app's do not work or either crash while using .\n\n3. screen resolution automatically shrinks to small ..you playing content will shrink small automatically ..you have to restart TV to get back to full screen mode.\n\n4. while playing videos online, screen flashes automatically which is very annoying...\n\nbottom line ....it's good for those who have less budget and want to showcase that they own smart TV but if you really wanna enjoy smart TV , buy Sony , LG or other brands with bit higher costs .",
            "awesome smart tv worth it, love it, picture quality is awesome than any other smart, its clear speaker sound is very nice you don't need any additional speaker or home theater for it.\n\nI love it and I know you will love it too just go for it.\n\nAshok Singh",
            "though the TV is very nice but I would suggest you to buy MI because in the MI TV the feature are very nice and it connects very well and the remote is quite impressive and all the features are very user friendly and the user interface is also very user friendly in the Micromax Canvas 81cm it makes a very slow reaction to the remote buttons",
            "good picture quality and service are good for installation and demo support or deliver within 48 hour fantastic",
            "Micromax is much better than Samsung or LG or MI TV's it have awesome picture quality althoth its not full HD its HD ready yet its picture quality is much much much better and satisfactory and if we see price its much cheaper thanbother brands like samsung or lg wich are just brand names with no better quality product i have Samsung 42 inch smart tv as well its picture quality is same as of My micromax Android HD ready led tv",
            "Nice design.. excellent picture quality, good sound quality.. easily connecting to mobile hotspot..basic apps are connecting easily. but facing lill difficult in Connectivity of some popular apps..over all... worth of money. I bought it for 12999/-",
            "Best product in this price, I think its a good choice and micromax really did a very good job Picture quality is awesome true HD and sound is best there is some connectivity issue but can be managed overall I totally agree to choose this product go for it guys made in india product.",
            "awesome TV , far better then MI tv , my friend brought the MI TV but MI tv picture quality is not up to the mark and compare to Micromax it's completely awesome. similar picture quality just we gets on sony ,or Samsung.\nthanks to flipkart and micromax for wonderful service.. :)",
