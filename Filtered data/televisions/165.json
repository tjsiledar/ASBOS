            "So I bought this TV last week. And I already knew the why and what of this product. Why to buy it and what to expect out of it. Actual user experience is of one week.\nKodak's CA series is one of the best range of LED Television that the company has put out, competing directly against the likes of VU, Redmi, Motorola, TCL..etc.\nSo let's get straight into why and what -\nWhy - Because it's a purely made in India product which can compete and win against some of the best in this price range when compared feature to feature.\nI had two concerns with this model. First it has single band wifi that will only connect with 2.4Ghz signal (I thought for streaming 4k videos you need to have 5ghz wifi frequency which will require Dual Band wifi which comes with additional cost), and second the storage is 8 GB out of which only 3.7 GB is available for use.\nHave been streaming 4K videos without any lag whatsoever over 2.4 GHz wifi. So that solves the connectivity issue.\nSecondly, being an android TV, it easily allows you to setup pen drive (remember to use USB 3.0) as a storage for apps. I am using a 32 GB Kingston Swivl pendrive which cost around 600rs. So this solved the storage issue. And hence my why was justified.\n\nNow what to expect out of this model -\n\nPicture quality - as good as any other brand in this price range and even higher. (Not comparing with LGs, Samsung's and the Sony's)\nSound quality - as good, if not better, than other brands in this price range.\nProcessor performance - more than enough for my requirements - UHD/4K streaming of OTT contents and XBOX gaming.\nCustomer service - Yet to experience it but guys from Kodak called me and asked me if the TV is working fine and also shared the customer care number and promised on site support. I live in Gurgaon. Customer care experience can vary from place to place.\n\nBased on actual user experience I can say that this TV has proved to be more than what I had expected.\n\nA pure value for money buy!",
            "I ordered on 19th march morning got delivered to home around 20th March 12.30 PM and installation done with in 2 hours\n1) It's like easy to install I can say plug and play\n2) 4k video quality is impressive\n3) Bezel less screen looks grand\n4) Almost 2 days so for no problem\n5) at great in online market cheapest in the segment\n6) personally I am happy for the selection - KODAK 65\" 4k,ANDROID 9",
            "Superb TV in this budget category, panel is extremely bright which gives fantastic experience while watching 4K videos there is no lack and transition is smooth, lower resolution videos are also giving good experience, easy to cast from mobile and laptop. Sound quality is optimum but i have good sound system and I have connected that system with TVs Bluetooth very easily. So it's the best value for money TV in this category.",
            "Quality of the product compared to its other competitor brands like Xiaomi, Realme, VU, TCL, etc is below expectations.\nHere is feedback after 2 months of usage:\n1. Sound Quality is very flat with no clarity and there is no Bass, just feels like loud noise for a low cost speaker.\n2. TV remote is of very poor build and not durable. My remote stopped working after 2 months.\n3. Picture quality at low resolutions like 720P or 1080 P is very bad and there seems that upscaling feature is not effective as expected.\n4. Even though its a Android TV there is no Update relaeased from manufactures of the softwares. Other brands offer a much better software patch updates.\n5. Android interface is very slow over the period it starts to get hanged and need to be hard reset. Some issues are there like volume missing which requires a restart. Also it takes time to restart the android boot screen.\n\nIn my opinion other popular brands are a safe option to buy since they have been there for long and large customer base ensures better software experience, features, better support from manufacturer.",

As a online purchaser i know the cons & pros of products, so i started searching, comparing the products & reviews. Like you, the first came in my mind was brand names like SONY, LG, SAMSUNG, etc.. But as of the present situation it was hard for me to buy those brands in limited budget. I need 4K UHD LED ANDROID TV with in my budget but without any compromise in features & performance. And it was the time for the new budget TV search. I ended up with the competiting Smartphone Brands like MI TV, MOTOROLA, NOKIA, REALME, ONEPLUS etc.. While, one of my friend recommended KODAK. The first memory arised in my mind was the old Kodak film camera. But i was really confused about buying a TV from KODAK. Started deep researching gone through different reviews, finally decided to buy it.\n\nAnd today, after using for one month what i can say you is..\nPROS:\n>The most attraction on this TV is its design. Its very light, slim design. completely BEZEL-LESS display as they offer.\n>Outstanding Display performance compare to other brands. Viewing angle is also great.\n>Data usage is very very less compare to smartphones.\n>Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Built-in Chromecast everything works perfectly\n>4K videos is very smooth & sharp. No noise or over saturation. Best LED panel.\n>Android 9 user experience is amazing. No bugs or lag\n\nCONS:\nFrankly i couldn't find out any con about this product.\n\nTo be honest i am 100% satisfied with KODAK.\nYES YOU CAN BUY IT! without a second thought.",

Nice picture quality, good build quality, fast delivery, fast Installation and as it is an Android TV you can get as many apps you want to get entertained.

If we are planning to buy TV means first of all our mind will go to only for branded like Samsung LG and Sony but in Flipkart all new companies are like Kodak Vu bpl etc which are new arrivals.

            "Hearing the name Kodak i felt bit nostalgic and i thought the brand will fulfill my expectations. So finalized my mind to purchase a Global brand made in India through experienced SPPL company. Being in the affordable price range, kodak 4K UHD, CA series gives premium look, stunning picture quality and good sound quality. Crystal clear Dolby vision along with 30W DTS True surround sound gives a fantastic experience. I found the Connectivity of this TV is best compared to other TVs available i...\nREAD MORE",
            "I have been using this tv for the past 5 months, so these are my thoughts:\n1. Picture quality is very good, can play 720p videos without any blurry effects. Dont recommend to watch 480p videos since the clarity will be less but still watchable.\n\n2. Sound is ok if u r in a quiet room, but with external noises it will be hard to hear unless you hav a external speakers or any other setup\n\n3. Connectivity is good, i am using jiofi to stream all the content, hav not faced a issue. Only having 2.4ghz connection though.\n\n4. OTT services like prime, disney+, netflix, content is good to watch with the HDR effects.\n\n5. (Major issue) Everyone's in a while tv will turn of automatically while watching any content ( not app specific). I have encountered around 10 times till now. NOT SURE IF ITS SOFTWARE ISSUE OR HARDWARE ISSUE. but it kills the experience.\n\n6. Remote is ok but sometimes the response might be slow, while turning on the tv ,mostly.\n\nPlease note: After purchasing this tv, will get a call from the representatives from Kodak telling that they wll extend the tv warranty by extra 6 months if we put good comments about the product and whatapp them the screenshot.",
            "Update-Review after a couple of month's usage:\n\n> The HDR is stopped working via HDMI( tested with ps4 and gtx 1650). Netflix dolby vision works.\n> The remote stopped worki g properly after 2 months. Support center wont troubleshoot propely. They asks for video proof constantly rather than understanding the issue. They won't event hint how to buy a new remote.\n> The customer service only works in the first week to get a high rating and slowly they wont care after it.\n>Cannot enjoy tv properly due to the misbehaving remote(automatically returns to home/skips content. Changed battery 3 times. Battery is not the issue)\n\nFirst Impressions:\n\nMy previous TV was VU 43inch fHD tv. 3 years old. The colors were bright washed, the gradient banding was high. The sound output below average.\n\nAt Present:\n\nAfter a weeks usage i would say the experience is good. Like its worth the pay, but not perfect (if you like to nitpick). But as a fily driver it performs and wont let you down.\n\nDisplay:\n\nThe display is good, there are slight gradient banding but wont affect the experience.\nThe blacks are deep. But the overall gamma is cold(can be adjusted)\nWhen viewed from sides, small blueish tint is experienced(may be gamma thing!!).\n\nSometimes the colors gets over saturated or flushed out. (Have to fiddle with settings to correct these)\nTested HDR with PS4, it does make a difference in gaming.\n\nDolby vision: there are a couple of movies/series in Netflix that support. Tested and works.\n\nRemote TV connectivity: update: dies very quickly, un reliable.\n\nWhen switched on, takes a little time for the remote to pair up and initialize or so. For a few mins the controls will lag, after 2 mins things will become smooth.\n\nSound:\n\nThe tv speaker is moderate. It does the job and way better than my old VU.\nConnected my 2.1 using toslink, the output is good(supports pcm and Dolby digital)\n\nHaven't tested hdmi arc's performance and support.",

            "Hi, Writing this review after 19 days of usage. I always believed in the myth that TV means we should go for Sony, Samsung or LG. But the myth is finally busted. I am the proud owner of Kodak 65 inch 4K UHD TV. I cannot be we can get such a big master piece at 49K which is the cost of most of mobile phones today. It is absolutely 5 star in every aspect of technical spec.. With all the anti china sentiments around, it is perfect time to bring home a product Made in India by a very old TV manufacturing Indian company. Not sure why people should go for major brand like Sony when we have everything and more in our Indian made brand at such a competitive price. I would say just close your eyes and click the BUY button, because I have done all kind of research before buying this master piece.\n\nI honestly request Kodak to make 75 and 85 inch TVs. I will be the first one to buy a 85 inch TV if they launch. If you ask me, every Indian should support this brand for their honest efforts in selling such a class product at this price. I used Sony 55 inch for last 5 years, this product beats Sony in every minute technical spec. I did quite a bit of research before finally settling on Kodak 4K TV. I myself is proud of my decision. Just go for it and say final good bye to all Chinese companies like mi, OnePlus, realme etc.,",

            "This is the best TV as far as price is concerned. It's worth. Life of all LED TVs are 5 years irspective of brand. Earlier branded CRT TVs was working good for 20-25years but now in this use and throw era better not to invest in branded TVs because life of all TVs are 5 years only.",

            "Writing this review after 3 days usage of a 50\" TV-\nPros -\na. Delivery and installation were done within the given time frame\nb. The picture quality is very good, you don't see any pixels even from a 4 feet distance.\nc. Android works pretty well, connects quickly with OTT platforms (used with PrimeVideo and Hotstart).\nd. Bezels are very thin, even the bottom one is just wide enough to show a Kodak logo.\ne. 1.75 GB RAM works fine, I don't see any lags even while watching part of fast action movies like Aquaman, Avengers, or any dance sequences.\nf. Works very well even with the hotspot network of my mobile. Watched 20-25 minutes of a movie on hotstar using my network mobile, and there was hardly any lag.\n\nCons -\na. Sound quality is okay, certainly has some room for improvement. Good thing is that it doesn't distort even at max volume.\nb. If I unplug the TV then I have to tune the TV again, which takes almost 3-4 minutes. I think it's more an android thing, rather than Kodak, or maybe I am missing something.\nc. Build quality can be improved - If I go very near to the TV, on the sides I can see a gap between the front-panel and back-screen. Thinking if I should report and ask for fix/replacement.",

            "Excellent TV for the price range. Picture quality is really amazing and sound is good. It has a decent build quality, but it feels a bit delicate.\nAndroid interface is good, but not as responsive as fire TV stick.

Reason is simple Good quality IPS panel\nSound is really good specially when u put on DTS settings.\n4k display is excellent\nBezel less display so design wise very good.\nCons\n1.

Sound quality some how not that much good. Connectivity to fast with blutooth, WiFi and HDMI cables. I purchased 50 inch TV with 1 year warranty which is quite less for trust. You need to extend warranty for better caring of your applince.",
            "Nice TV with Android supporting apps.\nOnly thing that is lacking is sound quality, it should have been much better as you cannot enjoy songs if you are music lover. Sound as compared to LG is nothing there with Kodak. Other than the sound there is nothing else that I should be complaining off. Kodak please work on your sound system.\nDelivery was proper and installation was also quick and the person made us understand how to use the remote as well.",

            "I am writing this review after usage of 5 days. I will try to be detailed with least possible words ;)\n\n1. Picture Quality - It's decent given the price at the same time don't expect it to BRAVIA level. Color repro is also good and white/black is also repo'd well. Though the viewing angle is not that great. You would want to sit around 130~140 instead of 170ish as mentioned.\n2. Sound Quality - This TV is loud and can produce decent mid and highs. Dont expect to produce good low's.\n3. Product Quality - That's questionable as in my TV unit, I can see gaps between screen and it's base. Interestingly, it's not interfering with picture quality or with colors.\n4. Apps - YouTube started crashing on 3rd day. Though, rest are loading fine.\n\nAs mentioned in title it's a decent product give the price. I will try update the review after some more usage.",

            "A good value product for the cost. The product arrived one day before schedule, neatly packed. The installer immediately followed up and it was installed on the same day. Picture quality is good. I could watch my favorite videos in 4K quality through you tube. But you must have a good Data plan. Else switch to HD or lower quality. I was a bit worried about the sound quality but I could adjust the settings to switch off the system sound and keep only the surround sound ON. After doing this, I really enjoyed listening to lot of music videos. A user friendly remote with a voice search assistant. I liked the product very much. The only con being the wall mounting stand could have been of extendable type.",
            "This was a great deal ofcourse at this price especially, kodak amazes us with its immense picture quality(comparable to some mediocre and premium brands ) and sound effects from Dolby , connectivity and other android features are all great, Google voice assistant is also responsive. Yet there were some flaws that I could identify such as the design and build quality , when the tv is wall mounted it's difficult to reach the usb, hdmi and av ports as they are placed at the centre of the back panel. It's manageable but quite annoying sometimes. The build quality is not very good but it does satisfy us. The screen is very close to being bezel less. The 1.75 GB ram does it's job , I wouldn't say it's very fast , but yeah it's fast enough , the 8GB internal memory was a disappointment because we cannot install a lot of apps , yes we can add an external memory support , but some apps cannot be installed on usb. The product is actually the greatest we can get at this price range. Installation was done within 4 days of delivery. Overall performance: works like a charm. :)\nEdit:\nThe remote had some issues after approx. 1 month of purchase, I contacted customer care and their service is not very satisfactory. Haven't received remote yet and the process to get it is very complicated.",

Then on the budget constraints I went for Kodak. I purchased few months back and I had no compliance and it works beautifully. Specially the brightness and the sharpness is too good. Sound is also very good. Keep the good work guys.\n\nOne small suggestion from my side is the wire connector. If there is an option to have a 90 digree bent plug, it will be good to have the plugs connection hidden behind the TV. I had attached the picture of the plug black of the TV.",

            "Great display panel quality at this price. Minor light bleeding towards the left hand side corners.\n\nSound is just okay - doesn't feel like 30W speakers. My panasonic with 30W speakers is much louder, crisper, and overall has a better balance.\n\nThe tv is very light and the build quality is okay for this price. Do not expect flex-free solidness.\n\nThe user interface is stock android tv 9. So that's good! Hopefully it'll get updates to at least android tv 10 and 11 in the life cycle of the product.\n\nThe remote is great if you have a live tv source. It's a big remote.\n\nIf you only watch content from streaming services, you might want to get a smaller smart remote and pair it with the system. Something more like the remote on a mi box 4k or fire tv stick.\n\nThe mount provided with the tv was extremely flimsy and not worth it. I paid the installation person rs.1500 and bought a new proper adjustable mount from him which looked a lot more solid.",

Right corner some white light dominated the output picture. When i complaint about this to kodak company they said that \"its IPS panel backlight,that is not the issue.\" This is the only issue that is also mild. If you use hd setbox it is not effecting output picture.\n\n2. Back panel usb ports, hdmi ports located middle of the tv. When you fix the TV with wall mount it is difficult to insert pendrive etc. These 2 are small issue only i have.\n\n\n\nFinal word.\n\nBest in 42\" smart TV.",

The design in sleek and elegant. The build quality is average, but it can't get any better for the price we pay.\n\n4k gaming and streaming has been great with this device. An external device (ex.gaming console, setup box, etc...) helps the 4k content run more smoothly.",
            "Being using it for a year now, awesome tv for the price. Good visuals, sound and features. I am using it as my PC monitor and the texts and visuals are crisp. The only issue is the UI could be improved as there is no way to control the brightness of the tv or other such settings when you in the android interface of the tv ... you can only see these settings on the lock screen or when you are connected to any input(hdmi, etc). But otherwise go for it as no other non-chinese brand in the market can beat this price at this time.",

If ur budget below 25k then u can choose this tv.this my honest review.thank u.\nI here that remote doesn't work after a month,you can control your android TV with Android TV remote app from ur Mobile then y u need remote.\n\nReview after 5 - 6 months\nPicture quality is awesome in this price range\nIf u compromise with build quality definitely go for this.\nI observed the con is build quality and sound remaining all good.",

I trended this product for a week to book and get it. But this tv is not working after 10 months of installation, inspite of guarantee n warranty the KODAK CO. team delaying to repair/replace the TV saying due to lockdown they are unable to give the repair service.

Their is no physical damage either on screen nor on body of TV, However, flipkart personal said it's internal crack and not covered in warranty. I said how internal crack can develop without any physical damage either on screen or body of TV that's means it's due faulty design of TV and should be covered in warranty. He said you speak to manufacturer.\nSo please think twice before buying any products of Kodak brand as their quality and design is faulty and prone to to defects that they will not covered in warranty.

You need it if you' watch more than just recommended videos or use TV apps frequently, BT keyboard is an option though.\n\nOverall I am satisfied !!\n\nBtw, as someone mentioned I did not get any call for 5 star rating for any gift or so.

(Not comparing with LGs, Samsung's and the\nSony's)\nSound quality - as good, if not better, than other brands in this\nprice range.\nProcessor performance - more than enough for my\nrequirements - UHD/4K streaming of OTT contents and XBOX\ngaming.\nCustomer service - Yet to experience it but guys from Kodak\ncalled me and asked me if the TV is working fine and also\nshared the customer care number and promised on site\nsupport.

            "Initially I was very sceptical about buying a large screen tv that too from a brand not very established in the market dominated by korean and japanese giants, yet somehow I did end up with the biggest screen tv that Kodak had to offer. What drove me into such a decision was obviously the customer reviews and the instinct. Kodak was a huge name in the picture industry but I had no clue how they would fare screen wise and I have to admit, I am quite surprised by the level of quality and value this 65\" tv has \"displayed\". The order was delivered on time, thanks to flipkart's prompt courier service and the call from the service executive followed almost immediately afterwards. The installations went smoothly and within a week of placing the order, I was watching 4k HDR content from my own mini home theater. After a couple weeks usage, there no obvious cons that I'd like to mention upfront, but I definitely think the remote controller could have been a bit more sleek and less ornamental. Android tv is a real boon and Chromecast just make things easier. If you have access to a moderately fast internet connection, you'll hardly notice yourself withering away infront of this huge portal of infinite content. Overall I think it's quite a catch for its price point and I hope I don't have to come back here to rant in case things go south after a while.",

            "Great TV\n\nHi all,\n\nI was sceptical in buying this tv since it was new. But the pricepoint and the reviews lured me and I gave it a shot.\n\nIt's been one month of use but I think it's a good tv.\n\nThe picture quality is really good. I watch 4k shows on it and it looks spectacular.\n\nThe sound is also pretty amazing. Most TV's the sound does not work as well and you need to buy external sound bar or system but this tv has Dolby sound so even at low volume you can hear things well.\n\nLook and feel : it looks really good. The stand is also metal so it looks premium. I did not wall mount the TV since the stand look is exceptional.\n\nThere are few cons that are not mentioned elsewhere :\n\nWiFi connectivity : maybe this is unique to my tv but everytime I restart the tv, it connects to the wifi but shows no internet. I have to create a hotspot on my phone, connect to it and then disconnect and connect with the wifi again for it to work. It's slightly inconvenient is all\n\nUSB connectivity : I didn't realise this untill I bought the tv and it's not written anywhere specifically but you cannot connect your hard disk to the tv. It only supports pendrive with 32 gb storage. That's a real bummer because I used my hard disk to watch movies and shows on my previous Samsung TV. This is a disadvantage. If I had known earlier I would have bought another tv. But what is done is done.\n\nI am overall happy with my purchase and Kodak should continue to make these TV's.",

Very bad choice\n7.Not even HDMI ARC\n\nMy overall view is, even if u have 4k quality high resolution picture without good sound and vice versa then its a complete mismatch and a Flop Combination which is what happening with me.. My final rating is 3/5",

It has built in chromecast but it doesn't always work well even on super fast internet. The bluetooth of this tv is the worst.

            "I evaluated all other products available in stores like SonyMony, Tata chroma, Kohinoor and many others who try to push various Chinese models. All large screen TVs have delicate plastic frames but all are elegant. Kodak is no different, in fact I find it sturdy. After purchasing i found the picture quality to be very nice and pleasing with easily accessible various picture modes like movie sports etc. Kodak TV is fast to bootup and all menus are easy to navigate. In fact I find MI4A TV, my previous purchase very sluggish and full of advertisements of various channels in patch wall which is very irritating. Sound quality is great, nothing to complaint about. Sound easily fills up my 18 by 12 feet room and I do not find any need for sound bar or external speakers. In fact this is my second Kodak TV after I bought 43 inch one for my office a few months back, you can understand my satisfaction with brand and quality. And most importantly it is proudly MADE IN INDIA. The delivery and installation were fast efficient and pleasant, done automatically without my need for calling any agency. Strongly recommend this brand and model.",

You can actually hear the difference it makes.\n\u2022 Remote is pretty convenient, having all the apps buttons\n\u2022 Easy to use interface\n\nWhat I don't like:\n\u2022 Display looks a bit white when seen from sides.\n\u2022 Default settings makes the picture very contrasty in nature. Not liked by everyone.\n\u2022 No 5GHz wifi support. If you really wanna pitch 4K and Dolby Vision support, why not include a chip that supports 100mbps? Seems like a poor omission from the brand.",

OTT works smoothly so i have movedfrom local cable and using JIOTV for live tv and other apps for binge watching.\n\nso am giving 5 for overall value of money.\n\nwill update later in couple of months with the observations if any . make use of the sale and enjoy new world of OTT nd 4k smart tv . cheers guys",

            "Don't expect that you will get everything from this tv, obviously most of the reviews are biased or they haven't used smart TV's before who are giving full ratings but here is my genuine review which you will get exactly from this TV.\nGot the 43\" in Rs 19700 in BBD after bank offer and using 500 coins. (Price-5/5)\nPacking was poor, the box itself was damaged but the TV was safe. (Packaging-3//5)\nSame day installation done, but very unprofessionally, the guy was in so much hurry and he installed the TV tilted and not in center where I told him. (Installation-2/5)\nPicture quality is very good, connectivity is also good, even SD channels look nice you can watch channels without HD box and HD channels from your old SD set top box it will not look blurred or stretched, easy to use, remote is also of good quality. (Picture-5/5)\nSound quality is average, but this TV is for my parents so it's okay for them.(sound-4/5)\nFinal opinion- In this price no one should expect alot from this TV, you will get what you pay. And this TV does the justice. Go for it you will not regret, it will fulfill all your needs. But if you don't have budget issues than Sony or LG will be best. But obviously you're here for a budget TV, so I recommend you to purchase this TV instead of Chinese TV's, it's far better. Chinese products are just eye catching, the materials which are used in them are of very cheap quality.",

After system update, Google Assistant stopped working which might not be that bottleneck for rest of TV operations only the Home screen Voice support is absent with this\n4. Sound may not work as you might have expected. If you enable DTS sound, you can not select sound profiles (don't understand logic behind this)",

Thanks Flipkart for the quick service.\n2. Picture Quality - 4K as well as HD picture qualities are extremely good. Even the SD channels are producing a decent view due to up-scaling. You can watch the TV from every angle due to it's IPS panel. There is no motion blur due to the MEMC feature. You can enjoy fast moving scenes without any issue.\n3. Sound : Sound quality is quite descent for moderate room size. Better than other TVs of this price range. You may have to add external speaker, depending upon your requirements.\n\nOverall- quite satisfied. Recommend all to buy this TV due to it's overall features at this affordable price. There was a a price drop of Rs1000/- after my purchase. However, Flipkart/Kodak have refunded Rs1000/- to my Flipkart a/c as a goodwill gesture. Really appreciate the same.",

Picture quality.\nBefore buying this tv, my main entertainment was my mobile which has oled display. When you come to this rv from oled display you will feel very disappointed. You can see a whitish fade on the screen always. Also my parents have a 10 year old Lg lcd tv which outperforms this display on terms of picture quality. There is no micro dimming in this product which is certainly a drawback.\n\n2. No 5ghz wifi receiver( contradictory to what is mentioned in kodak website)\n\n3. Very difficult navigation for tv settings and very restricted android features(you cant write/delete files to a usb disk)\n\n4. The native prime video app hangs all the time when you fast forward or rewind\n\nOverall i would say the product quality is no more better than the price we pay.Got it for 25691 on sale. If i was offered another chance and more money, i would have taken an lg smart tv and an android tv box seperately.",

Even cheaper brands provides these informations.\nAndroid software also not very user friendly. There is no clear selection for sound output.\nHDMI ports are provided with option of renaming the port, instead of providing ARC/CEC controls. This feature is useless.\nDue to poor technical support, I replaced one tv with flipkart. The replaced one is working good. But HDMI ARC port problem doesn't resolved completely. I have to remove HDMI cable from STB once and after sometime again put on STB and then ARC functioning properly.\nI am using this TV with Sony Home Theater, HTRT3 with HDMI connectivity.",

That's the reason I thought of trying this out.It seemed to be the best choice in this price range.\nDesign is good. I went for a separate wall mount than the default one as it had more range in movement and adjustment. Picture quality is great. I upgraded my setup box to HD. Though HD channels are more sharp when viewing, standard content (SD) isn't that bad. Sound is also okay.I use it mostly for home use and did not explore with content having more sound effects.\nSwitching to internet based apps seemed to have a slight delay, but then it might be due to my slow internet connection. For this price range and choice of brands available, I didn't have to think twice. I think of Kodak as a family friendly brand.\nFinal verdict: Reputed brand. Value for money. Go for it.",

They r living upto Make in India work no service.\n\nA word of caution when taking the 3 yrs extend warranty it looks lovely when u glance at it.But when u get intouch with flipkart it looks like a big scam by Flipkart.\nFlipkart will give u a invoice n not give u the details list of terms n conditions of the warranty which is on the website. I have tried following up for the terms of the warranty copy n spoke to over 20 executives who have no clue about the terms on the site n have practically refused to give the details in writing. Last person to speak with me introduced himself As Sr Executive Junet saying he has the authority to solve the problem. Sr Ex Junet was not even aware of the over 10 pg warranty terms n point black said flipkart will not give it n he can cancell the warranty if I keep insisting for the copy. That was his wonderful solution.\n\nBravo flipkart great way to handle a customer request for a copy of a document in public domain on your website. Keep the good work going Cheers",

            "So I bought this TV last week. And I already knew the why and what of this product. Why to buy it and what to expect out of it. Actual user experience is of one week.\nKodak's CA series is one of the best range of LED Television that the company has put out, competing directly against the likes of VU, Redmi, Motorola, TCL..etc.\nSo let's get straight into why and what -\nWhy - Because it's a purely made in India product which can compete and win against some of the best in this price range when compared feature to feature.\nI had two concerns with this model. First it has single band wifi that will only connect with 2.4Ghz signal (I thought for streaming 4k videos you need to have 5ghz wifi frequency which will require Dual Band wifi which comes with additional cost), and second the storage is 8 GB out of which only 3.7 GB is available for use.\nHave been streaming 4K videos without any lag whatsoever over 2.4 GHz wifi. So that solves the connectivity issue.\nSecondly, being an android TV, it easily allows you to setup pen drive (remember to use USB 3.0) as a storage for apps. I am using a 32 GB Kingston Swivl pendrive which cost around 600rs. So this solved the storage issue. And hence my why was justified.",

            "Good product\nVery easy to use.\nGood interface\nHave many connectivity features\nStunning looks\nHigh quality sound output\nBest product for every single penny spend",
            "I received this TV on 22 sep 2020 and installation done within two hours in same day of delivery, and Service engineer explained the features clearly. And I already knew the why and what of this product. Why to buy it and what to expect out of it. Actual user experience is of one week.\nKodak's UHD/4K series is one of the best range of Television that the company has put out, competing directly against the likes of MI, VU, Redmi, Motorola, TCL..etc.\nSo let's get straight into why and what -\nWhy - Because it's a purely made in India product which can compete and win against some of the best in this price range when compared feature to feature.\nI had two concerns with this model. First it has single band wifi that will only connect with 2.4Ghz signal (I thought for streaming 4k videos you need to have 5ghz wifi frequency which will require Dual Band wifi which comes with additional cost), and second the storage is 8 GB out of which only 3.7 GB is available for use.\nHave been streaming 4K videos without any lag whatsoever over 2.4 GHz wifi. So that solves the connectivity issue.\nSecondly, being an android TV, it easily allows you to setup pen drive (remember to use USB 3.0) as a storage for apps. I am using a 32 GB Toshiba pendrive. So this solved the storage issue. And hence my why was justified.\n\nNow what to expect out of this model -\n\nPicture quality - as good as any other brand in this price range and even higher. (Not comparing with LGs, Samsung's and the Sony's)\nSound quality - as good, if not better, than other brands in this price range.\nProcessor performance - more than enough for my requirements - UHD/4K streaming of OTT contents and XBOX gaming.\nCustomer service - Yet to experience it but guys from Kodak called me and asked me if the TV is working fine and also shared the customer care number and promised on site support. I live in Kolkata. Customer care experience can vary from place to place.\n\nBased on actual user experience I can say that this TV has proved to be more than what I had expected.\n\nA pure value for money buy!",

Sound is one of the best I heard in comparison to other TV, I also have a Samsung TV which generally play sound at 60-70 volume but in this TV 15-20 is more than enough.

Connectivity is not great every time I switch on the TV WiFi shows no internet but after restarting WiFi it's good. I also thought 2.5ghz will not be good enough for 4k but it actually has no issues playing 4k content. Bit of lag now and then think that's because of hardware. Also noticed frame drops while watching some Netflix content. On paper it shows too many features but practically they aren't that great but can't complain for that price. So I'd say right now for this price you can go for it but if there is no hurry wait for sometime new TVs might launch. I'd give 3.5 rating overall",

Need to do lot of research to get familiar with its settings.\n\nSometimes TV get struck if there is net break up in some apps.\n\nThis tv plays 4k videos very well, where as one can find some blur in tv channels.\n\nFinal verdict:- You will get more than what amount you have been paid. One can't compare it with TVs that costs double the price. It is the best option for budget 4k or bed room tv or 2nd tv users.",

            "After using for a year...\n\nPicture Quality: Brilliant and you can compare it with any other brand directly (Vu , MI, Sony, LG, etc.)\n\nSound Quality: Truly loud and clear enough.. Surround sound works too good with 30W speaker ..\n\nWhen you start playing 4k videos it will lag and at times the apps ( even netflix and zee5) would stop responding...\n\nAt times the remote does not work to start the tv, you need to start the tv using the TV button",
            "After reading the configuration and reviews, selected this TV to give a try. Here are the pros and cons.\nPros:\n1. Price: This is the lowest price for 4K TV range, I can find. Got it for 22K on Aug 2020.\n2. Picture Quality: The 4K picture quality is great. Can compete with any other Top Brands.\n3. Frame-less design: The screen looks great with slim bezels/frame. So sleek.\n4. Google Voice Remote: Great to use voice assistance using remote. It recognizes very well.\n5. Wall mount: It comes with Wall mount. It's Not VESA style mount, But still good for fixed mounting on wall.\n6. Installation: The service agent came next day the TV delivered. He fixed in short time. Didn't explain any features of TV (Not bothered as am well aware of the TV features).\n7. Packaging: It comes with default TV Box (No extra packaging). it's delivered without any scratch.\n8. Storage extension: Can use USB Drive as secondary storage to install apps (Must format it on the TV to use as default storage to install apps). Not sure what's the max memory supported, But am able to use 2 TB Portable hard disk.\n\nCons:\n1. Bluetooth: The Bluetooth range is very very less. I can keep the speaker, less than 2 feet for lag free sound. If the speaker/Bluetooth set moved far than 2 feet then it'll start stuttering. Didn't know Bluetooth has different quality (Thought Bluetooth has default 100 meter coverage).\n2. WiFi: The WiFi connectivity is very weak, 2G connectivity is not so great. It often disconnects even the modem is so close. so frustrating.\n3. Android: Frankly I don't like this android TV interface. I loved H96 MAX RK3318 Android TV Box has good interface. Very limited useful apps.\n4. RAM: 2GB RAM seems not sufficient. Boot time is long (2 mintues max) and apps are taking good amount of time to load. It's nature of Android TV.\n5. Ports placement: All ports are placed on one side. It'll be difficult and cluttered if you use more 1 HDMI/USB ports. It has 2 USB Ports which is very close each other, can't fit 2 USB pen drives together, have to use USB cables.\n6. Stand: The stand is so sleek, But not very solid. Can't place on small TV Table because it's so wide. (Center TV stand would be great.)\n\n\nOverall, If you are planning to use Smart TV options then make sure you connected with LAN Cable (RJ45), not via WiFi.\nIf you are planning to use TV with Set top Box or Laptop or USB Drive then This TV will be great (Bang for the Buck).\n\nNote: This TV doesn't have SD card mount (Saw somewhere advertised as it has one).",

            "Honest review on our Kodak 55ca0909\n\nWe already have the MI TV 4 Pro 55 Inch and decided to go for the Made in India, Kodak TV (manufactured by Super Plastronics) this time for our son's room.\n\nI will rate the TV based only on gaming and YouTube as the this TV is primarily going to be used only for that.\n\nDisplay: Its great. Nice and bright and the colors pop just right. We have it connected to the Ps3 and it feels that the TVs output is much more than what it is currently being used for. With the 60 Hz display it shows its weakness during fast motion scenes due the lower frame rates but not bad at all.\n\nOverall a solid 4/5 for display\n\nSound: The 30 watt speakers are more than adequate. Loud and punchy. Kept the Dolby mode on. YouTube videos and music is nice and crisp.\n\n4/5 again for sound.\n\nConnectivity: We have the Jio fibre 100 Mbps connection and are running it on the 5GHz band. Too bad the TV only supports the 2.4 GHz band. Speeds are decent but there is some issue with the WiFi connectivity everytime the TV boots up. This, hopefully, will be fixed through an update.\n\nA 2.5/5 for connectivity options and functionality\n\nOverall: 4.5/5 Build quality is average but for the price it's a no brainer. I would recommend this TV to all those looking for a decent Made in India TV.",

Whenever I switch on the TV to use the internet applications, it says \"cannot connect to internet.\" I have to forget my already added wifi connection and then connect again to restore the internet.\n\n2. I am being forced and constantly being called/messaged by SPPL to give rating in return of 3 months extended warranty. I hate being disturbed during working hours but they keep on doing this. The company has made a good product but they need to cut down on pesky marketing techniques.\n\n3. The quality of sound can be improved. Its not upto the level of a good TV.\n\nBarring these three reasons, there is no reason why anyone would give a bad review to this TV.\n\nUpdate: After using TV for 2 weeks now, I can also deduct a * because the Chromecast on this TV sucks. Many times it wont get connected. There is no fix to the problem so you have to live with it now.",
