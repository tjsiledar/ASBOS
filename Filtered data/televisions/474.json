            "If you are under 15k budget, you want HD quality screen.. this is it (its Full HD).\nScreen looks like a computer LCD monitor pitch dark black, very good quality material, feels premium, remote is Samsung standard remote, screen brightness is pretty good, you can control back light very easily also it has eco mode, where you can dim and also switch off screen if you want to listen just to audio (say news, music channel) .. it plays huge files without glitch, tested couple of mkv & mp4 container files having h.264 codec with 1080p resolution with mp4 AAC audio, it works.. have not tested all the file format.. I guess it should work most of them.. I also tested opening up my dslr photos which was 12-14MB file, it plays slideshow with out a glitch.. people who are bothered about the sound, I was happy with the output volume though 3Wx2 it is not that bad for the size. (It has two USB one with 1Amp and another with 0.5Amp) USB to USB copy works fine with Fat32 format, it failed for me to paste the file on NTFS HDD, nevertheless it reads my 1TB NTFS based HDD.\nWill try to update when I use it more.\n\nThanks",

I did it and I found it sufficient and this was a good deal in 10k",
            "the product was a replacement to my old tv and was delivered well in the time period, the old tv was taken and installation was done on the same day.\n\nthe tv is good in all terms as it gives 2 of each hdmi and usb ports allowing you to transfer between media drives.\n\ngiven its cost its a very good buy",
            "Ordered this product on 29th july and got delivered on 2nd july. Thanks to FK. Also one day later person from samsang visited and wall mounted the TV. This TV is very good, it's best in this range. I use this as TV and extended monitor for my laptop. Also i can play movies n songs directly from flash drive. Color quality is good and you can change it as there are meny options provided in the menu. Best one.",
            "Flipkart service was very nice. Got the product on time and packaging was very nice too. After 1 day of delivery, flipkart initiated the installation request for the tv from samsung. The next day samsung guy came and installed it properly with no problem.\nSound Quality of the TV is very nice. I could easily hear the tv content loud and clear. Picture quality is awesome. I found a little problem with the picture quality when I tried watching it from a little much lower angle. Picture was a little shady. Overall picture quality is awesome when watching from proper angle.\nI almost verified each specification detail given about this product and found it to be true. Now the interface. Interface is just very simple and easy to operate but lacks a little bit of functionality. For example if you are watching songs and want to go to the next song, either you need to finish the song by watching or fast forwarding it or you need to go back and select the song you want to play. Another bad thing is that you can't change the aspect ratio of the content.\nIf I'd have to give points to 3 main aspects of this product it'd be like following:\nAudio - 9/10\nVideo - 9/10\nInterface - 8/10\nRecommendation: Best Product in this price range definitely go for it. :)",
            "Samsung give us a great quality product the tv was very good in this price section tv features are so good and un predicted we fully satisfied with this",
            "Experience after one week of usage\n\nExchanged my 10 year old 22\" samsung CRT TV with this TV for Rs 8714/-,\nTv and remote are simplest and have more than basic features,\nConnected 1tb seagate which worked well, watching full HD videos is a delight,\nCan't believe those are just 6 watt speakers!!! Crystal clear sound, Bass lovers can surely buy any 2:1 speakers, thumbs-up to DTS surround sound effects, (hasn't tried in headphones)\nMagic angle is necessary if you are watching from a level below tv,\nPlenty of options for sound and display,\nWhile playing few full HD videos TV was unable to play them or got stuck in between but played after I reset display settings,\nColors look so natural in the display,\nAdditionally 3.5mm jack is provided in case you want to use it with a computer.\n\nUsing with videocon d2h sd and not much dilution of colors, will update after switching on to HD stb,\n\n2 USB and 2 HDMI ports sufficient,\n\nWell done and thank you to samsung and flipkart\n\nUpdate on 25-08-17\nShifted to videocon HD DTH, colour saturation is so beautiful loving it!! Certainly HD is better and preferred.",
            "Samsung led the best picture quality. full HD display, 2 usb function ok. but low sound not high level. screen not clear for close led and led down position.",
            "Nice product low price, mostly can prefer for small rooms. Timely delivered by concerned retailer. Great initiative by Fflupkart for timely installation...",
            "We have a 40 inch TV in hall and wanted to buy a small one for my parents room.\nIt feels very small and is not recommended for viewing from more than 4-5 feet away.\nTV built quality, audio and picture quality are very good. It can be used as TV Monitor.\n\nI recommend 28/32 inch for TV in bed rooms and 24 inch for monitor. Anything less than that are not satisfactory.\n\nBase stand was not fitting at all. It was tilting right and not balancing horizontally.\nAnyway my requirement was wall mount. So that was not a problem.\n\nThe power cable comes with an adapter like we get for laptops.\n\nOverall its a little overpriced and did not meet my expectations.",
            "Good full hd picture quality. Make sure it's connected to hd stb. Audio quality is very bad. The tv speakers are shit without any frequency response. Prompt and timely delivery by flipkart.. Overall satisfied with the product.",
            "The delivery of the TV was a smooth process and a wonderful buying experience as the delivery guy from flipkart was extrememly courteous and helpful.\n\nthe installation as well happened from Samsung soon from the delivery date.\nAll in all- this TV is quite impressive .",
            "It's a small tv ideal for bedroom and small areas. Delivery was prompt (on the 2nd day of purchase) and installation happened on the same day as delivery.\n\nVery good experience with the seller WS Retail as always, also happy with the Samsung service staff who installed the tv on same day as delivery.\n\nPlease note that the Airtel connection for 749 rupees was of no use to me since I opted for multi connection with my existing Airtel DTH for only 690.\n\nAlso, the tv was really small compared to what was shown on the website.\n\nHowever, it's a good buy if you are looking for tv in small rooms.",
            "Product is very good for the price range and for small room. Picture quality is very good. Have very good features also viz. usb to usb transfer, no need for separate stabilizer as adapter is provided with the tv (only tv in this price range which comes with one.), read almost all the video format. Read my 1tb hdd.\nBut i am flattered by flipkart service. Hats-off guys u nailed it delivery was way within scheduled delivery date. After delivery flipkart booked the installation service with samsung without my knowing it was smooth service and now today got a message from flipkart that if there is any issue with installation just give us a miss call. That's called a prompt service. love flipkart for the experience.",
            "Excellent TV in this price range.\nworking like a charm.\nSuperb clarity. I mainly look forward to connect external harddisk & play movies. My expectation just fulfilled by Samsung TV. Its is suitable for small rooms, if you are planning on buying this model just go for it without any hesitation.",
            "Its the best in its range good full HD display. Worth buying. No need to browse for other models. Go for it.I have brought this for last 6 months and is running superbly smooth!!!!\nThanks you Flipkart for good packaging and on time delivery",
            "I am using this TV for last 1 month. mostly being used as a monitor.\npros:\n1. It has got a brighter picture quality.\n2. Documents and other office stuff can be easily read for a long without strain on eyes.\n3. The sound is good for a small room size, but if you are looking it as a TV then need to have a better one.\n\nCons: still not found any...",
            "Completely satisfied with this buy. Plays 95% of videos. Audio quality is good as well. Screen clarity as well is good.",
            "Loving the tv. Got it on big billion day fr 9980 aftr all the discounts. Clarity is at best. Supports most of the formats. Sound is great. For a small room or bachelors thumbs up.",
            "Good One with budget.. Good Sound Quality,Full HD ..\n\nTwo HDMI are working fine\n\nTwo USB ports are working fine ..\n\nIf your are looking for 11k with full HD this is the Right one",
            "As of now it is working great. Great display. I got it for my home. dint work with HDMI and USB. just used cable. as of now it is working great",
            "The TV has many features at this price. The screen size could have been a bit larger as the picture looks very small when viewed from 10 foot distance. But, the Full HD display is awesome. Another con is the sound. Not that great when compared to the other features it boasts of. Anyways, its really worth for the money!",
            "Display quality is very good. I will suggest to buy this product.\nI found that All LED TVs requires HD channels settop box to get good picture quality .\no i want a LED which gives best picture quality in standard channels or cable channels . Finally I found This product on Flipkart which Gives all features as well as my expectation .\nFlipkart sells this item lower price than other shopping sites .\nso I bought via Flipkart .\nitem delivered as mentioned in this site and package was awesome.",
            "I ordered this TV on Nov 9 and it was delivered on Nov 21 as per the agreement. Many people are complaining about the viewing angle. I faced the same problem too. This TV is equipped with Magic Angle. It can be found inside Picture settings. Setting it to Lean Back Mode with a value of 7 to 9 gives me a better viewing angle. I watch lot of movies lying down on my bed and the magic angle helps.\nI follow this and I get a better viewing angle every time.\n1) When I am sitting down and watching TV, I switch off Magic Angle or use the standard mode in it\n2) When watching TV lying down, I use Lean back mode with a value of 7 to 9\nIt makes a huge difference.\nI have connected the TV to my Creative Roar BT speaker. The sound quality for the movies is awesome this way.\nI also use my TV with Tata Sky HD. With HD channels the picture and TV sound quality is awesome. You should watch HD movies with DTS TS turned on. I max out the volume in my Tata sky and control the output with Samsung remote. This TV also has a manual EQ mode which helps with overall sound quality.\n\nThe USB ports work perfectly. I have attached a USB Hub with Memory card reader to it. I watch lots of movies through my SD card and every quality from 360p to 1080p play flawlessly. Glad that this TV supports multiple video and audio formats.\n\nThe reason for four stars is because of the manual adjustment I have to do every time to suit my viewing angle. I also own a LG 22 Inch LED which has IPS display. Unfortunately it has a much better viewing angle without any manual settings.\n\nOverall really worth the 11,190 that I paid for this.\n\nThe shipping could have been a little faster. But the installation was done on time and the technician was very good. Thanks WS Retail and Flipkart.",
            "Yes i bought it on 31st May 15 it has one drawback is that view angle is not as much good i suggest you to improve it.otherwise its awesome product with reasonable price.",
            "Excellent Product, U all would love it !!! on time delivery, First class product and amazing video and audio clarity. I have connected my DTH and also Chromecast and its excelllent",
            "First of all the product, in home appliance, Samsung is the leader. This is the best deal I had from Flipkart on TV. Its best fit for low budget, Full HD, truly good pic and Sound is also very good. Clarity is also amazing.\n\nLast the delivery, WS Retail, just superb !! Within 20 hours I got the delivery and installation done.\n\nThanks Flipkart Again",
            "This is a good TV, especially for the price. Picture quality is good.\n\nThe only two things I don't like so much are\n- the sound quality is not so good, enough for TV viewing but listening to music is not so great, base seems to be weak\n- some settings disappear when the TV is turned off (for example date and time), other settings are stored\n\nFor both these issues the technician had no solution.\n\nNote: product comes only with power cord but without any additional cables, so you need to buy them yourself.",
            "upto the budget of 11000 this TV is very popular. i bought it at price of 10890. i got free installation. tv quality is superb HD quality superb. very lightweight and nice looks i also using it as a pc monitor. sound quality is very good loud enough like the other tv... 2 usb port dont think just order this one... u will love for sure.",
            "I compared the product against other models from diff companies. This one is very good at the price. Sports mode is fantastic. Picture clarity is ok on non-HD DTH connections. Happy with the Flipkart delivery and installation support services.\n\nWall mount is not provided with the product. If you need it, the installation guy will bring it with him. Be careful they gave us a local made wall mount and not the Samsung one. Check it before installation.",
            "For Flipkart: You guys rock..!! Delivery within 2 days and in my desired time slot and also did follow ups for my convenience.\nThe Product: Best at this price. Trust me you won't complain about display and sound. A very good product to install in rooms (size 10 * 10 or 10 *12). If you are looking for installation in Hall then better go for a bigger one.",
            "GOT REPLACEMENT FOR FAULTY PRODUCT. HOPE IT WOULD WORK ATLEAST FOR FEW YEARS WITHOUT FAULT\n\nThe product is very nice. Sound quality and picture quality is nice.

            "I ordered this TV via flipkart. Got delivered within 2 days. Awesome delivery service from flipkart. They mentioned within 2 days product will be installed. Nobody contacted me for installation. After 2 days i called flipkart with in a day they arranged service engineer to install the TV.\n\nAbout TV: Its a nice budget TV. Sound also feels good.

            "This TV is meant only for those who are Tech Savvy and Tech Wizards and have a natural intuitive flair for anything tech related. I belong to this Category.I had been researching on this Particular Samsung Model UA22F5100 was the last 8 months and just on seeing the display on Flipkart I knew this is what I wanted and never felt the need to visit any physical showrooms to see the demo of this model. I would have ordered this in Jan-2015 itself but for some house-hold impediments[My Father & His thinking of clinging to all old things purchased for the 1st time himself]. Finally the impediments were solved by themselves.\n\nI had a 23 year old [1992] Crown FS-2179 16 Channel CRT Color TV weighing over 20 Kgs which was working but was on it's last legs as the HT Transformer was making a shrieking noise since 20-08-2015. Hence decided to get rid of it and the best option was Samsung UA22F5100 22\" LED TV on Flipkart with Exchange. Also the Seller was WS Retail hence had no qualms in ordering it. Got Rs 1150/- off for the Old Crown TV[After deducting Rs 50 pick charges from Rs 1200/-] Placed the order on 22-08-2015 @ 10:34 AM and Order was completed on 23-08-2015 @ 11:00 AM. Both Delivery of New Samsung LED TV [SSTV] and Pickup of Old CRT TV happened simultaneously as the Old TV was kept in pickup ready state and shown in working condition to the Pick Up Staff. All paperwork with purchaser ID Proof was done and over within 15 Minutes. Paid the Net COD. At 11:20 AM Received SMS From Flipkart that scheduled installation & demo was done with Samsung & would be completed in 2 Business Days. However Despite being a Sunday [23-08-2015] Samsung Service Technician Called @ 02:25 PM and Installed the TV in 10 Minutes before the Start of Rahu Kalam @ 4:30 PM. Such Professional Service can only be expected from Flipkart & Samsung.\n\nFeatures:\nThe SSTV has two HDMI Ports HDMI-1 & HDMI-2. HDMI-1 is used to connect HDMI Cable from Dish TV HD Box. The SSTV does not come with HDMI cable in the box so before ordering locate & connect your HDMI Cable from the Dish TV Box or buy before hand and keep it ready. HDMI-2/DVI is used to connect PC/Laptop to the TV via DVI/VGA To HDMI Adapter. Again the adapter is not in the Box. If you connect the HDMI Cable from Dish TV Box to SSTV then all other SD channels + HD will also come via the same cable. You don't need different inputs for different formats or remote selection menu.\n\nSS TV has 5 RCA Type[VCR Video Out Type] In Ports which is 3 Video Y[Yellow Green]-Pb-Pr and Two Audio L-R for Analogue video/audio signals from SD Set Top Boxes like Hathway and DEN ADN. The Analogue signals are also displayed much cleanly and better than in a CRT TV with just AV In Ports.\n\nThe SSTV has twin USB Ports with different power settings. 1 with 5V/0.5 Amps current Rating & Another with 5V/1 Amp Current. The lower current rating is for Pen Drives and Card Readers and the Higher current rating is for External USB 2.0/3.0 Portable Hard Disks. I put a Toshiba Canvio 1 Tb USB 3.0 HDD and it was detected and all files and folders were opened and Video & Audio Files & Images could be played and seen. Same with a Kingston 8 Gb Data Traveller USB 3.0 Flash Drive. However if you have a flash drive which is Connected & stored with Dish TV Box Videos then it is not detected on the TV.\n\nIt has a external head ear phone socket meant only for headphones where the output volume is low. The internal speaker cuts off when head phone is put. The dolby sound quality is excellent in all modes like Standard, Movie, Sports, Dynamic. The SS features audio/video cleaning and voice filtering circuits for both picture and sound. However if you connect an external speaker to headphone port then all Dolby Sound Effect is nullified and analogue sound only comes. A Word of Caution here. Don't put the pin and remove it multiple times or else the headphone pin can become loose and then sound will not come on the SS TV speakers. Use a Extension cable with stereo pin to TV fixed permanently and socket on the other end.\n\nPicture Quality via Dish TV HD Box is amazing, same with Sound Quality Also. Don't think twice before buying this SS LED UA22F5100 on Flipkart especially under exchange for your old Dinosaur CRT TV over 20\" in rooms of 12' x 12'. You can't a better deal as of now or in the future. Order Right Away before stocks or exchange scheme ends.\n\nPros-Everything Cons:None As of writing this even though order has been successfully executed by Flipkart & Samsung in less than 24 Hrs still order delivery status is not updated in the website. Updated:26-08-2015 15:50 Hrs:- After I sent a E-Mail @ 03:00 AM of 25-08-2015 Flipkart Updated the Delivery Status in not time and I was able to download the Invoice in PDF via E-Mail which was necessary for warranty registration on Samsung Website. Fully Satisfied with Flipkart as well as Samsung. Will keep everyone updated about the working of the TV.",
            "I must say flipkart beats others in delivery and installation. It was super quick and hassle free process. I bought this for parents after checking reviews, I haven't seen the TV yet but i heard its good. Good pricing compared to prices at shop. Suggestion to Flipkart, add suggestion tab for products. Like voltage regulators or speakers etc.",
            "Every thing is good about this product.\nDisplay and sound is Very good. Many good features are available to adjust Video and audio to suit to your taste.\nIdeal for smaller rooms.\nA note for people who wants to use it with SD set top box. The picture quality will not be as good as a CRT TV if composite video (AVI) is used. This is probably because no up scaling is done in the TV. This TV needs input from HDMI or component Video source to get a good display.\nI am using this TV for more than 3 years and it is functioning fine.",
            "this is the cheapest Full HD Product you can get at this Price range.\nAmazing Product.\nFlipkart Amazing Service\nAfter Delivery, Samsung people will call and do free installation and demo.\nLoved the service !!!\nJUST GO FOR IT !!!!",
            "I purchased this model in 2013 and have been using it since then without slightest trouble. At the time of purchase I scrutinized all the models and makes in that range available in the market and this model from Samsung topped the list in every aspect - price, design, picture, specification etc. I carried a pen-drive containing files of almost all the video and audio formats. Even the salesman was also surprised when Samsung accepted every format. And now I can recommend this product without...\nREAD MORE",
            "i ordered this tv on 15th june 2015 and was delivered on 16th june 21015 so flipkart service at its best once again for me...it was well packed and delivery guys were good n cheerful.\nAnd flipkart arranged my installation trough samsung technician within 6 hours of delivery..excellent service i must say by both flipkart and samsung team.\nNow coming to the tv..well i had searched all tv companies of there 22inch and 24 inch models in all e-commerce sites as well as brick n mottar stores.\nAnd was tempted by some of VU company models and AOC models too, as for AOC its a equally good and reputed company and there service and products are very good too as my brother uses one of there tv, and for VU well its new company to me and no much feedback i could get either from web or retail stores, so VU was out from my list.\nSamsung had been my first choice in electronic products as there service is awesome and products are reliable too, and as far as tv is concerned i liked samsung the best as there picture quality is unmatched by any company be it sony LG philips etc...\nBut samsung products price were on higher side in each category then its competitors( primaryly for there quality i guess)...\nSo i decided to give it a try and see if i am lucky to get there tv within my budget, and to my luck i got this model within my budget with all features i wanted and even more features dn i expected.\nits full hd tv with 2 hdmi n 2 usb ports exactly what i wanted, plus samsung 22inch means 22inch+ as its almost 56cm tv rather then 55cm it should be(checked on net and also verfied myself too).\nSo, finally ordered the tv and was extremly happy as got my favorite tv brand with all features i wanted, and that too within my price budget :) ...\nNow as for real performance is concerned, i have used the tv extensivly for past 24hours and here are my points i found out:\nThe picture quality is superb and crystal clear with right brightness and contrast ratio too.\nEven tough i am using a SD cabel connection the picture clearity is superb and colours are vivd even better then the sony 32inch tv i have in the hall.\nThe sound quality is really really good and clear and very loud too as i am using in my bedroom of size 15feet by 14feet ( till now i have used only volume level upto 50 out of 100 for some enhlish channel only while for hindi channel like sony colours life ok etc i have used till 38 only out of 100) as the sound is very loud which is an added bonous point for me as never thought could get a tv with such nice clear and loud sound.\ni watch the tv from a distance within 10feet and its very clear from this distance, as i can clearly read each and every letter in the news channel which is very good for me as my last tv which was CRT model i could not do so.\nwhen watching movies or soaps the picture comes very very clearly and vividly, and even my wife is happy by the performance of this product too :) ...\ni connected my laptop using HDMI cabel i got from flipkart too to this tv and display was superb ...played latest tomb raider game at full HD, mind blowing realistic it looked...\nSo my final verdict is if u want a tv to watch within 10 to 12 feet of distance expecting to have a veryy clear picture and good readability of words too and crystal clear loud sound within RS15000 then this should be the one as its from a big brand company with great after sales service record till now...\nOnly one regret is that the tv cost in flipkart Rs11990 which higer then Snapdeal price which is selling this tv for R11500, but snapdeal was taking 10days time to deliver while flipkart took 1 day only so guess its worth it...",
            "1.First of all let me clarify few things, i read few reviews saying viewing angle issue,but it works perfectly fine for me no issues on that.\n2.no issues on sound intensity. good for this range of TV.little on the lower side but that's fine\nas its observed it varies between channels (something related to cable operator)\n3.i just love watching HD (1080 p) movies by connecting my Hard disk on this TV\npicture perfect.\n4.Loved the delivery by flipkart on time.",
            "Pros:\n1) FULL HD\n2) Compact and sturdy build quality\n3) 2 USB Ports 1 for HDD 1 for Pendrives.\n4) 2 HDMI Ports (no need to switch every now and then)\n5) Speaker Volume is lound enough\n6) TV Remote quality is very good.\n7) Free Wall mounting kit. (Given at the time of Demo and Installation by Samsung service person)\n\nCons:\n1. No HDMI cable is provided with TV\n\nGo for it.",
            "This samsung tv is good and it has all the reqd features. it is the best in segment tv in this price range. we can go for it without any confusions.\nI liked the flipkart price range which are lesser than the outside market. so i bought 2 samsung tvs thru flipkart. i tried to place order for 2 more tvs for my friends but it is not allowing to place order for more than 2 tvs.\nwhat bothers flipkart if i m using my money for 2 tvs or 20 tvs. pls remove the restrictions and provide the tvs based on the customers requirement.\n1 star lesser for this issue with flipkart service.",
            "Delivery was perfectly done by couple of guys. They carried carefully up to the 4th floor and asked before opening up the package and when agreed, they opened the package and showed me to ensure that product is intact. It was in perfect condition. I only wanted the table top setup so I fixed the stand myself and checked all the connections myself and everything works perfect except that it does not read 1TB hard disk - however, it reads smaller size USB drives and plays any and every type of movie files as well.\n\nI also tested, tata sky HD and non-HD channels and they are perfect. Sound is good enough for the TV of this size. This is my secondary one and so I am quite happy with the product experience so far. Its been more than a week now and its been doing well.\n\nService guy also called and checked it out - he marked the serial number for warranty purposes.\n\nSo, I am happy to recommend this to anyone looking for a small size TV with full HD. Its value for money! (I can bet, its quite a wise decision because at shops this TV was more expensive definitely since I checked at a few retailers myself)",
            "value for money product, fantastic as a second TV for your home bedroom or office, fast delivery and service from flipkart, I'm happy to buy this product at a very good price",
            "Good in this price range, working well! 2 USB work in better way that's play many types of vedios. LED display is also good. Some sound problem, not so good as required. Almost average for below 11k.",
            "Before buying this i had shortlisted 3 similar brands in its class which are sony and LG, but i found this product best amongst them because of great features, advanced technology ,style,design,and of course Full HD at this price also brand like Samsung.\n\nThanks to Flipkart & Samsung & Axis Bank, delivered & installed as promised timeline and given EMI option with low interest.\n\nReally amazing service !\nCheers!",
            "I got it delivered on 29/01/2015 and it's awsome viewing this Full HD TV 1080p. This is the overall best TV in its category compared with Sony and LG. Sony has a bit better sound quality except that all other features in this TV is way ahead.the others. this TV is an inch bigger than Sony and LG, because the side bodering is thinner than the other 55.88cms(Samsung) compared to 54.74cms(both LG and sony.\nI have physically seen all the three TVs and then reviewing for the product.\nDont miss the offer the TV is cheaper than others.Superb TV, superb Quality!",
            "Its a awesome Full HD TV which cost me 10600 Only. I am thankful to Flipkart for this amazing and genuine product.",
            "I bought this product for my single use. Almost in the same price range Micromax was offering 32 inch LED. To be honest I was tempted to purchase a 32inch by paying Rs2000 extra, but I stuck to Samsung. Now coming to the review of this LED.\n\nWhat is good? So when we are going to purchase an LED TV, we primarily look out for 2 things- Picture Clarity & Size.\nIf you are looking for an LED TV for a small room, then this is the product you are looking for. It is, perhaps, not idle for a bigger hall.\n\nThe picture clarity of this Full HD LED is very very good. Even normal channels look very good. HD Channels will blow our mind for this price range.\n\nWhat is not so good?\n\nThe sound speaker is not so good. It is just below average. When you are watching an HD Channel, you would like to have better sound system. A good speaker system would be useful though. Moreover, almost every LED TV has average to normal sound out put. You need external speakers for better sound.\nFinally, Best for Bachelors, small rooms. Go for it",
            "The features offered at this price are exceptional. USB play is super easy and fluid fast. Picture quality is awesome but you need HD SET TOP BOX to get that HD picture. Sound Is nice and has good effects. Design is minimalistic. Services like installation are on time and nice. Flipkart shopping is awesome.",
            "1st: Thanks to flipkart for very swift delivery and late evening installation. Had requested for same day installation and they did it!!! The guy came at 9 pm to setup the wall mount. Thanks a lot.\n\nNow lets come to the product:\nI have been using it for 8 days now. And I am completely satisfied with the TV. Very good quality resolution. HD resolution is super. Perfect for small rooms.",
            "I got this product on the day of promise by flipkart. Product is awesome. All works. Well Samsung tv is good. Good to see if it's. Support android mini pc",
            "Viewing angle is 120 Degree. Other TV like LG Sony has good viewing angle compared to Samsung 22F5100. Same model number in joy series is also available.\nI purchased this TV thinking its of Joy Series.",
            "I did not purchase this from flipkart, However, I had to write a review as its such a nice product. Overall I am satisfied with this Full HD LED TV. You can go for it without second thought.\nPros :\n1. Excellent Picture quality.\n2. Sound quality is good.\n3. Design is supreme.\n4. Extremely light weight.\n5. Power consumption is very less.\n6. USB to USB transfer, screen and sound capture ( It can be done only if you connect USB or HDD)\n7. plays almost all the format of videos seamlessly.\n8. Quick detection of external device connected.\nCons:\n1. No facility to switch between the paused Media content and set-top box content. if you pause any videos you watching in USB and switch to cable or set-top box content and again switch back to videos in USB, you must start the USB content from first. ( you can anyway pause, stop, forward and rewind the content while playing USB content )\n\nUpdate after 2 years of purchase:\nThe tv switches off after an hour of usage. Sometimes it switches off even before that. I called a samsung technician and they informed me that the entire board will have to be replaced and it will cost me around 11-12k. I had to sell the tv dirt cheap due to these problems which sprang up immediately after the extended warranty ended.",

            "Dear people,\n\nI bought this item nearly 10 days back. It was delivered and schedule demo with wall mount. Guy who came to fit it, is not even showing interest and he did not do the wall mount properly and now we are not able to see the LED tv because it is not fitted properly. I raised concerns in very next day and these people are not showing interest in re-fitting the LED tv. They were post-poned two times saying issue will be resolved in 2-3 days. I just got irritated and returned the product.\n\nThanks\nHari Krishna.",
