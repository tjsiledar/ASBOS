            "This is good TV this price range and I pretty happy with Jeeves service, second day TV installed by the service center team. Now if we go with Picture Quality is pretty good, I have a Samsung TV and comparing them, both are producing almost same picture quality, I did not find any major difference, Very little difference difficult to Identify with naked eyes.\nIf I talked about the sound quality, it is good, but not as compare to MI and Realme, I found Bass is low in this TV, but as per the overall performance it is nice TV to have in this price range, you can go this TV without ay doubt.",
            "The smart TV is upto the mark and well appreciable in the range with its sound, picture quality and screen dimensions. The ease of connection further leverages the American brand wrt other companies. I suggest to buy it in this price range of 20k. Best wishes.",

            "This led smart tv is a very good option if you're on a budget. The ips display panel is bright and viewing angles are great. With 3 hdmi and 2 usb ports, the connectivity options should suffice for most people. I have faced no lags or crashes with the in built android tv. Youtube, Prime, Hotstar etc all work fine. Overall, I'm satisfied with the performance of this tv. Hopefully it'll provide years of trouble free performance.",

The service person on first place said this TV (Thomson) is not a good brand and will not work properly even for 6 months and trying to sell stabilizer for TV which will make it last long were now-a-days all TV has inbuilt stabilizer. He said that if you purchase stabilizer online the TV will go bad only the stabilizer which he sells (around Rs.1800) will protect the TV. But a normal stabilizer cost is less than Rs.1500 I hope so.\n\nThe installation guy behavior and knowledge about the product is zero. I have already read may reviews of Flipkart product most of the review the Jeevs installation/feedback is very poor. Flipkart has to think of dropping their contract with Jeevs and go for a better company interms of installation/service who do not make customer panic of the product they purchase.",

            "DON'T BUT THIS....... IT'S A BIG TRAP\nEarlier when I purchased this TV in Aug 2021, I rated it with 5 stars. But within four months of using it, the smart remote started to malfunction which eventually made the TV Non Operational. Majority of the buttons in the remote didn't respond. I replaced the batteries with the new ones but still nothing improved. Finally I contacted Thomson Customer Care (which is all the more hard to reach). Instead of replacing the faulty remote, they suggested me other irrelevant measures like replacing the batteries, downloading a remote control app on the mobile phone etc etc, which eventually failed. Now they're asking me to courier the faulty remote (Courier Charges have to be born by me).\nAdditionally, don't buy the COMPLETE PROTECTION PLAN (which is a subsidiary of Flipcart) for any of the device because when you ask for a claim or repair or replacement, they will trap you in one or the other TERMS AND CONDITIONS like remote, plastic, rubber, fuses is not covered, accessories not covered. They will say that you have handled it irresponsibly, fair wear and tear etc etc etc.... No end to this and eventually you will loose the battle. And irony is that they are selling their plan as COMPLETE PROTECTION PLAN and making fool of their customers.\nPathetic after sale support. It seems that Thomson and Flipcart are here to just increase their sales. No matter what happens to the product and the customer afterwards.\nI will rate both Thomson TV and COMPLETE PROTECTION plan alongwith Flipcart negatively. DON'T BUY THIS..... ITS A TRAP",
