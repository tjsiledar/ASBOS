            "I bought this 43 Inches Micromax LED TV (4K). Feeling good about it that you got a big TV at comparatively at much lower price.\n\nBut of course I do not think you can consider comparing it with the big brands on \"all\" features..\n\nPros:\n1. Picture quality is fantastic for now. I have been using for last one month now. I have downloaded 4K vedeo from U tube and the when you watch on your TV its fabulous.\n2. Sound quality is pretty good.\n3. You can install Google play store and then what not? Yo...\nREAD MORE",
            "First of All, Is it worth 4K TV for 30K+? Yes I'll say.\n\nThings I tested with, XBOX one Forza Horizon2 crystal clear scenes for off road rides. Macbook pro retina display copies to tv while watching via hdmi. OnePlus2 miracast transfers accurate sound while play n pause. And last 4k videos watched hobbit movie. On dark scenes can see difference in colors on clothes (2TB hard disk no lag).\n\nAbout sound 35 volume level is more than enough for home. 45 to rock ur streets. Max 100 tested no blur bass.\n\nVideo mentioned above.\n\nScreen 43 inch fills eye with clarity( dnt expect clarity for <100MB video songs pixel breaks).\n\nApps: As Miracast works no need to install apps(Cant find much apps in TV playstore)\n\nMake sure you buy VGuard crystal plus stabilizer highly recommended(cost 2.5k)\n\nTested 3D movies of 50GB in size of single file. As you know 2screen vl come. But can see the picture quality on 4k tv.\n\nMade gud purchase for deepavali bought for 33,489 cashback 3k for citi card. With 3yrs warranty\n\nAbout installation table top 6screws you fix on your own in 5mins time. For Wall mount call customer care they vl do rest for you.\n\nI got gud piece with no scratches anywhere pakka(perfect) packing.",
            "Great product and good service by Micromax.\nFirst of all I wants to make it clear that the product is good enough.\nI found many great features in this tv.\nI got a android 4.4 kitkat version with 2 GB RAM and 8 GB ROM.\nI would like to mention a few fuctions which include Miracast,Mi Screen,Multi Screen Sharing and a lot more.\nYou can access the web using its pre-installed browser or you can install chrome or any other browser from the Google Play Store and yes, First of all you need to install Google Play Store from App Store.\nI have read a few reviews saying that Youtube App does not work well in this Smart tv. Yes the app does not work well but wait, Have you ever installed Youtube app on your PC,everyone of us know that Youtube app is for Smart Phone not for Smart Tv. The Youtube work very well when you open its site. And one more thing, you will need a good internet connection like 1 or 2 mbps.\nSuperb Product. Go for it.",
            "Got this awesome 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV @ 33489 only in Diwali Offer.\nFlipkart made my diwali.\nsimply amazing TV experince.....\nThank you flipkart.......",
            "Nice display\n\nIts is an Android 4.4.3 Kitkat with 2 GB Ram & 8 GB memory (Available 5.4 GB).\n\nNice User interface with Smart remote cum air mouse.\n\nOne star less because YouTube is not playing properly and hangs often when YouTube is played. Hope for a better update.\n\nCan cast mobile screen to TV (Miracast) and TV screen to mobile (M! Screen), isn't it amazing.\n\nPlayed Angry bird without any Glitch.\n\n1 + 2 yrs warranty. Overall value for money.",
            "This is a honest review\nTrust me on this!\nI bought the tv it worked fine fr 1month\nThn it didn't evn start always stuck at welcome screen!\nIt has only 150mb ram\nIf u know technology then u will understand with ths less ram no appliance can work fone.\nPlease don't buy\nTake it as a advice frm me\nI an not lying I promise",
            "I am giving 2 stars only for the display quality which is above average but overall, it's not up to the mark.\nI had to return the same and get a refund. The problem essentially was with the specifications where it says that there is an optical sound out whereas in actual,there isn't any so my home theatre would not connect with this piece unless I chose to compromise on the sound output and use a mono jack given.\nAnother very irritating problem is with the UI and smart TV functions and especially youtube. It would always hang after 2-3 video views and then one has to switch off the TV to see a video again. This is too much.\nSo in a nutshell, if u r looking at buying an affordable LED TV, buy the plain LED TV but do not go for smart functions as these low end TVs and designed to perform optimally.",
            "Overall a good product. But there are few issues which I have reported to the Micromax support and they are yet to solve it.\n1. The screen mirroring is not working.\n2. None of the apps are downloading through the playstore, even if there are lot of space and even after inserting SD card.\n3. Also the volume is not controlled by tatasky remote. You need TV's remote which is irritating.\n\nThe support team should provide solution for this, else my TV is not a Smart TV.",
            "Excellent Product its good product and have a fun with best price and getting 4K TV. Hats of to flipcart and Micromax.",
            "This review is after two day usuage.. it will be updated further after extended usuage\n\nDelivery is done on date as promised by Flipkart... The have arranged the installation and demo on four days later... I had no patience so i installed it with the help of local electrician.\n\nVideo : the video quality is very good... Hd channels in Videocon looks awesome... But the standard channels looks a little bit stretched... Tested some 4k samples recorded in my oneplus one... The quality of playback is good\n\nAudio: the audio is pretty same the other led TVs... No noticable downs or ups.\n\nSmart functions: this is the part where the tv lost one of it's star... The smart options are not that good.. screen casting is working but there is slight lag in video but huge lag in audio.. so casting is basically useless if you are casting a video... you can cast pictures though.. the browser is good but has minor bearable glitches.. You can install YouTube from playstore and play videos... But there is no option to adjust resolution.. so it plays in bigger resolution and requires good internet speed without buffering\n\nOverall the tv is more than worth every penny spent (33.5k)... I am happy with the purchase...",

This is too much.\nSo in a nutshell, if u r looking at buying an affordable LED TV, buy the plain LED TV but do not go for smart functions as these low end TVs and designed to perform optimally.",
            "Overall a good product. But there are few issues which I have reported to the Micromax support and they are yet to solve it.\n1. The screen mirroring is not working.\n2. None of the apps are downloading through the playstore, even if there are lot of space and even after inserting SD card.\n3. Also the volume is not controlled by tatasky remote. You need TV's remote which is irritating.\n\nThe support team should provide solution for this, else my TV is not a Smart TV.",

            "Product worked fine for couple of months and first it stopped to connect with WiFi networks and after one more week, often the remote won't work at all. Had a Micromax service engineer address the issue but he could not troubleshoot it and I was asked to bring the TV to service center because the display started to show blue lines after the engineer tried to solder some circuit on the pcb. Had to take a day off and took the TV to service center. They kept it for almost a month and offered a ...\nREAD MORE",
            "good but not best in this price range. One should expect a better product if paying 34k.

Picture clarity is good and sound is also good.",
            "I am writing this review Today not just because it\u2019s been almost 2 months I have been using this Micromax product without any issue. Contents & features of LED are Over Expectations for this price.\nGr8 finishing as it looks as decent as any other good brand LED TV but it's cost makes it much more better..\n\nPros :\n# 4K HD Picture quality is fabulous on big 43\" screen looks like mini theater in price what we get.\n# Sound quality is really great as well\n# Wi-Fi Connects very well.\n# YouTube & other useful apps has been preinstalled. There is internal storage available if you want to install other apps.\n# Best for gaming as you can play games in 4k which makes the games more realistic. Overall complete Entertainment available in one box.\n# Flipkart delivery was excellent but had to chase for installation support.\n# Enable 2yrs. extended warranty which Micromax is offering.\n\nCons:\n# Android version is bit old & isn't up-gradable & the functionality is bit slow.\n\nPerson who came for Demo & Installation was not having any knowledge on the product. It seems that he just came to drill and wall mount the LED. Apart from this no other issue faced with this purchase.\n\nBig Go Ahead for buying, if this product is available as you will not be able to find any better television in this price range.",
            "The best configuration 4K smart tv u can ever expect at this range .!\nUl love it .",
            "For this price this TV is excellent, Youtube App does not work but that is the problem of APP however TV also hangs after app crashes that is something they need to fix. Some times internal browser also hangs while watching youtube on that. So all the major issues are with Youtube which they can solve by just giving native youtube app.\n\nPros :\nPicture quality is excellent brightness, contrast and color. Colors are little saturated which you can adjust manually. Audio is also fine not the best but cant expect more at this price point. One way to solve this is upgrade android and support Apps like Voot, Hotstar TVFPlay etc...",

Mircast is not working perfectly with my phone redmi note 4 video and audio lag each other but with other phone it is working without any problem",
            "The product is good, but if you are going for a 4k TV select screen size more than 50 inches, that is when you can enjoy true 4k picture.\nThe connectivity options are good along with the smart interface.\nThe support engineer from micromax had no idea about its feature and told me that other engineer would be coming to give demo of product feature.\nStill to receive any response on that.\nWould appreciate better coordination between the brand and flipkart when buying flipkart assured product.",

            "The android ported on the TV is not very different from that meant for phone. The smartness is really questionable. It's really competitive in pricing, but it comes with a lot of issues. I would suggest to go for a non smart version and invest in the Chromecast/firestick. The OS of TV is best avoided.",
            "I bought this product 1 month back\nIt works fine. Display is good. I would rate display 9/10.\nIf you're looking for a smart TV this is not your product. I would say this TV is not as smart as they say. It has in-built app store which is practically useless, you can get Google play store as they say but the problem is it is outdated version. It's tricky you get Google play store but you can't download any applications unless you update Google play services which won't UPDATE for some reason . I realized it after buying it I asked flipkart if I can change the product they said it's not possible.\nI'm left with a TV which is called \"smart\" but in reality nothing works. It is a regular TV which can connect to wifi for browsing.\nYou can't get applications like Netflix, youtube, hotstar.\nYou can get outdated chrome which is super slow for browsing.",
            "Product is not good , there is a problem with software, playstore won't work. Technician confirmed that playstore won't work in this tv . he told that I asked with head office they told me same ..

            "Got the product delivered in two days. Nicely packed and shipped in good condition. Talking about the product, first of all, the TV looks very good in appearance. Specifications are at par with the other in this category but the quality matches that of the leaders in the market. Voice and picture quality is awesome. 4k display, Ultra HD, LED and smart TV is this price is really a deal to grab on. Overall the product is awesome and worth getting. Grab it ASAP.",
            "At this price this it was a steal deal, I had no idea micromax can give us such a good product and super quality. Pretty happy with our Indian Company :-)",
            "On the whole it's got great hardware output for the price. The pictures are clear and sharp with no issues. However the refresh rate and the software that comes with the tv are really poor. So if you are into gaming this is NOT the tv for you.\nSecondly I would like to mention about the extremely pathetic customer support they have.\nSeeing me my friend had bought the same TV . During normal usage his TV developed a crack on the inside. When he contacted the\"customer care\" he was said they had no responsibility and the guy actually said \"me UP ka gunda hu..zyada mat bol saale\". Can you believe it?\nThe one year warranty and two years extended warranty is nothing but a beautiful LIE.\nMy TV has no issues but my friends TV is still down with no fault of his and they are asking 25000 rs to replace it , having only used it for one month.\n\nExtremely PATHETIC and ALARMING customer care.",
            "I Booked the TV and received the delivery within two days and installation within two days of delivery.When I read the reviews about this TV I was a bit hesitant but after using it for 2 days I found everything very easy to use and every feature is properly functioning.It has motion sensing games which only requires a connection using WIFI between mobile and TV.\nCamera which have wifi can be directly connected to the TV. All Android apps are functional in the TV.Resolution and picture quality is more than excellent.It comes with an easy to use mobile app through which you can connect to the TV and use your mobile to control the TV , play pictures , videos , and music wirelessly.And yes it comes with miracast function also.This TV is worth every penny.All thanks to Flipkart for giving me such a TV at such price.",
            "Funny. Submitting my review for the 11th time . Micromax need to work hard to release a tv which can compete in market. HD channels will display quality of SD channels. SD channels have no quality at all. You cant watch SD content on this tv. TV software is a big mess. You cant cast video from smartphones. You cant play HD content while using tv in smart mode.

            "I am now fan of Flipkart. They are the real online players with guts in online marketing. I have bought so many items from Flipkart from 500 to 50000. They never gave chance to frown on any product. Very good service and after sales service as well. I want to say that they are doing it so well and its very tuff to maintain no 1 position in market. But with their services they are making it extraordinary for customers. They treat their customer very gently and like god of business which is very good.\nThis tv is very good and as described on site. I am very happy with services and product.",
            "Great product for this price. Installation person unable to contact to my WiFi, but later another technician fixed by resetting to factory defaults.\n\nProns:\nPicture quality is good\n4k video play is awesome\nEasy to use Smart features and remote control\n\nCons:\nQuality of normal channels may not be clear unless you set the display in box mode (Tata Sky display settings)\nLauncher is getting stuck occasionally when using smart features. Working fine after restart. Frequently getting stuck while playing videos in TV. Not a good smart TV.\n\nDon't switch off TV directly, use remote control to power off. Use stabilizer of at least 1kv to prevent fluctuations. This will prevent software being corrupted.",
            "Nice product .. i searched lot of tv's with all aspects .. brands like LG and Sony with same aspects are too costly compared with Micromax UHD tv.

I tried all inputs hdmi.. usb.. etc . All are working fine.. feeling happy about my purchase. Thanks to flipkart & Micromax ..",

            "I got this TV from Flipkart and I've been using it for past 6 months. It's a good TV and service is very good. I've faced issue with the aux port, of you want to connect external speakers to the TV it might be a problem. Even though it's a 4K TV, display is not very clear (compared to other brand 4K TVs) I think it's better to go for same model without 4K.",
            "Nice product, a masterpiece from micromax. Clarity is too good like most of the bigger brands. Only facing problem on conncting my mi phone thru miracast. (hence one star less). I don't know whether problem is in phone or tv.",
            "I am impressed with the features of the TV, The remote is a normal TV remote, but has a mouse button, When you click the mouse button the remote works like a laser (very impressive as it works from 15-0 feet distance also).\nNo HDMI cable provided in the box. Micromax should provide the HDMI cable for FULL HD and SMART TVs.\nThe micromax engineer while installation, couldn't connect to my WIFI, I registered the complaint and the other engineer also coudn't do the same. I myself tried some tricks, firstly browsed interent by connecting TV directly with the LAN, resetting the WIFI router, updating the WIFi router firmware. My luck it connected to the WIFI\n\nI messaged for Extended warranty to the micromax no. before 31st Oct, also got message that you'll be contacted within 48 hours to confirm bill, and serail no. of TV, but didn't get any call from MICROMAX. will try to contact them again.\n\nAPP store is limited, but you can download the GOOGLE PLAY STORE, then then INFINITY is the limit. The display is above satisfactory. SAW some 4K videos from YOUTUBE.\n\nImpressed with the delivery. Got the product in 2 days and installed on 3rd day. may be I am in NEW DELHI (metro city). OVERALL very good TV. WORTH buying. VALUE for you money.",
            "The TV says it is android TV, but you cannot use any feature, if you are running youtube the tv stops responding in few minutes and then you have to plug it out. TO use the screen cast feature you need to have an old android phone with miracast feature latest phones will not support it. Only thing you can do is use it as normal TV with OK OK picture quality.\n\nAlso Micromax does not provide any software support for the TV, there website does not provide any support or firmware for TV's.",
            "Timely delivered, this is my 2nd TV purchased from Flipcart of same brand. Both are of good qualty.\nNo proper installation. ( No one came from company for installation). there is toll free number for registering extended warranty ( don't know, whether they registered or just a fake marketing)\n\nyes, this tv supports all video formats. Quality is good. Remote can work in all direction as it is RF remote.\n\nit does not supports installation of apps from internet.\nsurfing Google/ Youtube with its keyboard is hectic.",
            "Generally for electronic goods the warranty is 1 year, but I never thought that the product will work only for one year. I bought the 43 inches smart TV on 27 Dec 2016 which was delivered on 29 Dec 2016 and the smart TV worked exactly for 1 year which stopped working exactly on 29 Dec 2017, What a coincidence.",
            "At its price range this TV is exceptionally good. And the extended warranty is a very good add-on.\n1)The sound is good enough.\n2)If you want to connect head phones, speakers to this TV you'll have to buy an additional digital to analog converter, since this TV is not Bluetooth enabled either.\n3)Best part, even if the picture is scaled you cannot find pixel's that's what matters the most really!!\n4) As an Android TV it's not so good. Only devices having KitKat android version can cast something onto the tv screen. Net surfing works fine.\nOverall the TV is working like a charm so far",

I have purchased 1 Vu led fhd 43\" TV , but this Vu TV display went faulty after 1year & 8 months only & company says the repair will cost me as much as the cost of new led TV. So I will advise any one who wants to buy led tv., Please don't buy Vu TV, as you will have service issue & the life of TV is very less as compared to the Micromax TV.",

Their technician visited our home and said TV needs to be replaced. Now it's almost 1.5 months and still not replaced. All the local service nos provided are incorrect. I am fed up following up with customer contact center, every time , there's a different story. My advice is to stay away from the product and don't by TV etc from Flipkart even if it's cheaper.

Only the thing is that part of Sony, Samsung, lg are very expensive. After warranty period, if your tv faces major issue, you will have to bear around 80% of cost for repair.

No demo even how to operate they did not said. Very disappointed. And as demo and installation is free service written there why should we pay rs.500 for the demo. As the engeener has not shown any demo to us. Flipcart is charging this amount. I suffer it from the delivery of the product on 23 Rd may, now 1 St June, still my t.v is off...see why should we buy entertainment device, to close or to open? Very very disappointed.
