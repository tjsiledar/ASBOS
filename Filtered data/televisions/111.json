We just had to plug it but had to wait for the person from company to come. He sold us an extended warranty by taking 2K more. I wish we could take that warranty online and install it by ourselves. We had to wait four days after delivery just to remove the tv from cover and plug in so that the warranty remains intact. This is the only aspect I didn't like. Rest YouTube reviews are good enough to learn how to operat it. Please keep brightness option in the from only.",

            "This product is very bad. I have bitter experience with this product. I purchased this product on 6th February 2022 and it was installed on 7th February 2022. But when it was start, the function of wi-fi was not connecting to any wifi enabled device. Technician advised to replace. So I choose replace option. Flipkart delivered new one on 18th February and it was installed on 19th February. But again on 27th February, display stopped. Then I informed to Kodak TV and Flipkart also. Flipkart contacted time to time, but there was no response from Kodak TV. Service of Kodak TV is very bad. I had to find out the status/progress to Kodak TV by phone. They have no any responsibility. One-time Kodak TV emailed me that this product is not directly sold by them, so their technician will visit first. But Flipkart sent technician and after check he told me that panel board is bad of this tv, so you replace this with good one. Flipkart is very good, their team return this product and refund me full money. I am very happy to Flipkart. Kodak 7XPRO is not durable or stable product, I think.",

And def there are some pros and cons\n1.Speakers are good but above like 70-75% volume the sound starts to blare.\n2. Depending on the viewing angle you can see color difference , I think this is because the display isnt IPS..\n3. picture quality is very \ud83d\udc4c nice......Just banger.....\n4. Android is the true thing that actually uplifts the TV... the connectivity with smart speakers is good.....\n5. There is no DOLBY AUDIO or VIDEO.......I thought there def. would be but yeahhhh BUMMER....\n6. Software is Okkk...\n7. The back of the TV is just THICC and bulky looking.... It isn't a deal breaker tho as it isnt gonna be seen ....\n8. Remote is quite good \ud83d\udc4d\n\n\nWhen i was buying There were two options KODAK and THOMSON.... same price qnd specs.... but i think I WOULD HAVE GONE FOR THOMSON instead as it was slimmer....\n\nSTILL ITS A GOOD TV and DONT FORGET TO BUY THE ADDITIONAL WARRANTY... as you dont know what's gonna happen after some time\ud83d\ude1b..",

            "Well and good quality",
            "The best in this price segment. I will tell you reasons, why you can prefer this, among others.\n1. LED TV- So it's as clear from any angle as from front. Even if my mom is cooking something in kitchen, she can clearly see pictures as it is which is at another angle.\n2. Sound can be very loud, but quality can be improved.\n3. Very light weight. Seriously very light weight!!\n4. Simple to use.\n5. Least price I guess from others, and if you buy with some card offers then you may even get 1500/- off, which I think decreases it's price.\n6. Also there is no LED TV in this price, there are LCD or Other panel, sp check before you buy. So, LED was my first priority for good, clear viewing angles\n7. Not very good for connecting laptop or using as a monitor- Bigger in size and refresh rate what I noticed shud be more if you connect computer/ Laptop.\n8. It has all connection for av, audio in/out, BT soundbox or any Bluetooth speaker. Sometimes I watch movies connecting my Bluetooth headphones/earphone, which I s great, Only I am the one then hearing.\n9. Remote is very handy, less buttons, and more good.\n10. Remote' s google assistance works like a charm, just press the button and say hindi songs or anything in hindi or English or any language.\n11. Plenty other good features, BTW I have a YT channel ankitanandvlogs, so I keep connecting my laptop to Tv too during edit in Premiere Pro, after effects. But not very okay, for using as monitor as I see pixel density is less, also bcoz screen is bigger. Better buy monitor of less size instead, and remember it's a TV. And you need to adjust color for better viewing.\n12. Service seems good, as they came for installation for free and looks like they will assist in future too if required.",

Compare to cost picture quality is superb. Color contrast is eye soothing. Side boundary is very thin, so you get full screen.\n2. Compare to cost sound quality is superb. With maximum volume also sound doesn't crack. It's loud enough for big room. Yes ofcourse you can connect home theatre system if you want cinema hall effect.\n3. Bluetooth remote, so you no need to point towards the TV. Easy navigation and google assistant is there for you command, ofcourse you will need internet.\n4. For internet you have both provisions RJ45 Jack and WIFi. Choice is yours.\n5. On time is faster than my expectation.\n\nCons:\n1. Delicate handling required, TV body is not strong enough, only trained technicians can handle.\n2. Back side connectivity is bit difficult to access, even for pen drive you need to lift the TV. Either you connect extension cable for that or lift the TV everytime.\n3. Sound on bluetooth headphone sometimes crack or delayed. This TV has some issues with bluetooth speaker, may be it's particular unit issue or a general issue of this model, I am not sure.\n4. Application installation space is less, so if you want lots of app to install like mobile, there is no space for that. Few apps it's okay.",

Need to talk to Customer care on this\n2) Wifi was not connecting initially but now it is fine after reset. If it persists, i again need to talk to customer care.\n\nCustomer support was prompt and received call within 24 hours.\n\nSpecific to Android TV (and not Kodak)\n1) Interface of android tv is bad. They are forcing you to use the voice commands/searches. There by collecting important data from the users\n2) Typing the characters 1 by 1 is a pain. If you have a bluetooth keyboard, operating the tv is a breeze\n\nNon smart TV is the best according to me. Non smart TV paired with fire stick, chromecast or Raspberry Pi would be a much better product overall.",

They will only click photo with mask and sanitizer. They don't even know, what is a smart TV. Bad experience.\n\n2. Picture quality is fine.\n\n3. Sound is not good, you want to add a separate sound bar.\n\n4. Prime, sonyliv, MX player, discovery+, zee, hotstar tried, all working fine. You would need some subscription on each. Netflix is not there.\n\n5. After a month, starts some lag, but this is due to lot of applications installed.\n\n6. Definitely not for playing games.\n\nOverall, installation experience not good. This a very basic smart TV within budget. TV is a 4 star for rating, I have given 3 stars due to poor installation experience.",
