Bezel less\n3. WIFI connectivity is good (not checked for LAN)\n4. Bluetooth connectivity is good, connected speaker and were working fine\n5. Remote is ok, never dropped connectivity over Bluetooth with TV\n6. Boot time is average (30sec-1min) could have been better\n7. Audio is loud enough for medium size hall\n\nCons:\n1. Should have given Android 10 to exceed in competition, not sure is upgrade will happen\n2. Software lags at time, but experienced this occasionally\n3. Audio has no bass\n4. No 3.5mm jack leaves connectivity restricted to Bluetooth, this can be an issue if you want better audio experience and your sound bar or speaker setup lacks Bluetooth\n5. Most importantly, viewing angle is good only if you are viewing within 90-120 degrees, moving farther will degrade the color and experience\n\nWho Should buy:\n1.

He said it was minor problem and not eligible for replacement.... This was on 16th January.\nNow after just 3 days... Again the sound in DTH service is gone now... Its working fine on my other TV so no problem with DTH service or box..\nThis time again return of product was still valid on Flipkart... So now I am going to go for replacement only....

The picture quality is vivid and crystal clear with no problems of blur or color grading. I think OnePlus display is the best amongst its other competitors\n\n2) Sound :- 3/5\n- The sound on this TV is a bit disappointing. In the 40 inch variant, there is no AUX port nor an HDMI ARC port, so connecting other sound devices is also a problem.\n- Sound quality in tata sky set top box is decent, but on other OTT apps, you can hardly tell any dialogue that is being spoken in the movie.\n- Had to externally purchase a soundbar (Zebronics 60W) to complete the sound criteria which is bad on this TV\n\n3) Connectivity :- 4/5\n- Connectivity is awesome, no Bluetooth disconnects or WiFi issues whatsoever.\n- USB connectivity is working as it should.\n\n4) Software and Feel :- 5/5\n- Software is Android 9, keeps getting updates sometimes\n- Panel and TV quality feels premium, bezels are very thin and it looks like a complete window , which feels amazing",

It only supports optical or hdmi with ARC (Audio return channel) or Bluetooth.. These connectivity options are not supported by most of the mid range sound systems and if your have a sound system already at home, most likely it may not have these connectivity options.\n\nIf you want to go via converter route, optical/hdmi to 3.5mm or rca, then be prepared to shell out 1.5k minimum and still suffer mediocre quality.\n\nExcellent television for the price save for the sound routing issue.",

            "I'm totally new to the smart TV's as my old LCD TV lasted around 5 years. and 5 years ago only few were making LED and they were costly.\nsince my old LCD TV is dead, I decided to go for LED Smart TV this time.\nLet's start with the pro's:\n1. Bezel-less design: You'll get complete screen. you won't loose pixels because of the large bezels.\n2. Gamma Engine: You'll get wonderful videos with vivid colors.\n3. 1080p supported: when you purchase a TV at this price range, we'll more likely get 1920*768p. but this tv supports 1080p video output.\n\nNow let's discuss about con's:\n1. You'll need a wifi router to cast your mobile to TV.\n2. Chrome cast consumes a lot of data while casting. so you'll end up spending a lot of data for casting.\n3. Mira cast is not supported. which is why you'll need a wifi router to do chrome cast.\n4. Weak Design: they just pasted the frame with the display. since it's bezel-less display. so instead of bezel holding the display. it's just a glue which pasted between display and frame. when i first got the tv there was a small gap found between tv and the frame. so i got it replaced.\n5. You can't use this tv as a bluetooth speaker for your mobile phones. only way to play your music on tv is casting the mobile display to your tv.\n6. there's no separate button for audio only mode. so if i play some music video on a video player, i can't able to put it on audio / music mode.\n7. There's no music player apps for android tv. so you had to play the music with media players only (Ex: VLC)\n\nVerdict: It's a good upgrade from a LCD TV. but still, I still don't find this not so useful. I still cast my mobile to laptop and connect my laptop to a tv using HDMI to listen to music.\nI still had to connect my laptop to my tv using wires since there's no mira cast.\nonly difference is, i used to play my multimedia contents using my STB before i got this tv, now I'm playing my multimedia contents directly on this tv.\nso, if you have a perfectly working LCD TV, keep your tv and don't go with this one. because i didn't find that much of a difference from my old LCD TV.\nbut if your old tv is dead and looking for a new one go for it.",

            "Hi recently purchased the 1+ Android TV but the 1st TV tha was delivered for faulty and had a huge gap between the screen and the external pannel on the edges. Raised a Replacement request and the 2nd TV was sent. This one didn't have any external issues. But then a FireTV stick connection was not established with any of the HDMi port, there are two ports. After some struggle the connectivity was established. The Casting worked during the installation but unfortunately it hasn't worked since then. I have raised a request which is yet to be resolved. I am told it could be potentially due to poor WiFi connectivity, which I peoved is not the case. Now after a week the FireTV Stick doesn't connect to the TV Audio, I have to switch it off and restart the TV to get it connected. Again not sure what's the issue, will have to raise a request again. I am not sure if others have faced similar challenge but elaborating it here for benefit of people who may have faced or will face in the future.",
