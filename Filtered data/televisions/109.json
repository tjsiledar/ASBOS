            "its a good tv in the price range. far ahead of existing MI,TCL and all other tvs of this price range. color is awesome, contrast level is also very good. it offers extra picture enhancements like live color, black correction etc. picture wise no complains. many ppl wrote its a VA panel has viewing issues but trust me its awesome to watch this tv.\nSound is awesome, my hall is 22*18ft and sound is nowhere less in any corner, dont expect it to be like hometheatre. i did not face any connectivity issue yet but yes, it takes almost 1 min to get all the connection ready which means if you just start and open youtube it will not connect after 30-40 sec it starts all connection.\nsome thing Nokia may improve :\n1. I personally dont like the surround sound feature as as soon you make it On the bass vanishes.\n2. frame rates could be better like if it gets an update like MEMC or motionflow technology of Sony it would be an awesome deal. currntly it is also good\n3. 5G wifi is not supported only 2.4G is supported\n\nGo for it if you dont want to spend 1.25 lakh for Sony\nCheers!",
            "During 2020 big billion days i bought it.After so many research ....( I was planning to buy a Sony TV... but we can blindly save a lot of money if you go for Nokia with same config.)\n\nGuys...I\u2019m sharing my feedback after 30 days of usage.\nTV clarity , design & sound everything is good ( you don\u2019t even need external speaker). Delivery was super fast .\n\nMy installation agent was very hurry & rushing.. which makes me uncomfortable. Except everything is good at this moment. Thank you Flipkart \u2764\ufe0f",
            "The TV is just awesome, don't believe in any roumors it works like a charm. Picture quality and sound are unmatched in this price range.\nThe issues which this TV had earlier\n1- Wifi issue : This is fixed via an update (though it was possible to do manually )\n2- Tv reboot : This only happens when u play Dolby vision HDR videos and that is due to slow internet speed, I have 20 mbps wifi plan and it only buffers in Dolby Vision HDR 4k videos but when i pause the stream for 15-20 seconds it works like a charm so a solution to this is to have good internet speed 40mbps recommended.\nI didn't find any issues with wall mount as well, the sound is simply breath taking i never increased the volume to more than 25% its that loud and crisp. Considering playing 4k videos it works beautifully on all ott platforms like Netflix, not having Dolby vison and dual band wifi doesn't make any difference as the picture quality is excellent even without Dolby Vision for a normal user you simply cannot find any difference in Dolby vision 4k HDR video and a normal 4k HDR video and single band wifi works like a champ no issues faced as of now (except Dolby Vison enabled 4k HDR videos on youtube), rest all 4k HDR videos stream without any issue even with 20mbps speed (on youtube and all ott platforms).\nComing to setup box i have Tata sky setup box and believe me even sd channels look brilliant (recommend viewing distance more than 5 feet), Haven't tried hd channels on tata sky yet.\n\nMy conclusion is just go for it without any second thought, 50\" variant is much better than 43\" in both picture and sound.",
            "After Lot of Search i Choose this Tv and it's Very Good Decision for me and My Family.\nEvery one is Happy with Tv.\nSound is very Good\nPicture quality is awesome\nConnectivity is superb over mobile Data and WiFi also\n\nBut Only one things is not good it's Installation the person is came and he was in hurry so he didn't give proper time for demo.\nEven i feel tv is not Proper install on wall mount.\n\nOther wise almost 5 out of 5",
            "I start with cons as pros are everywhere.\nCons:\n1. Panel don't have good viewing angles especially in bright daylight conditions, u can see lots of reflection if you are sitting slightly on left or right.\n2. Don't support 5Ghz wifi, so my wifi do have 5GHz with 100 Mbs but this TV connects to 2.4GHz having 40Mbs speed, you can still watch 4K content, but I noticed it's not super smooth, also live HD channels viewing experience is not that great.\n3. Sound quality no doubt is good, but sometimes you feel there's a need for external sound bar n sub woofer.\n\nThat's all, I have given it 4 star just because of its value for money, I can't find a TV under 40K giving this much features.\nIf nokia can improve on first 2 points, there's nothing much left to argue to be honest.\n\nSo whom I should recommend:\nIf you have a closed room, with minimum sunlight, this panel display works for you. I have added pictures, refer them.\nAlso if you have wifi speed of > 40 mbs at 2.4GHz, this TV displays smoothly.\n\nHope this helps, I have added pics with 4K video running at 90 degree n around 140 degree, check them out.",
            "For price...this is a great TV. Good picture quality..bright screen..sound is great for a TV..although i noticed some audio sync problem in netflix. For the asking price..it is a good deal. I hope it works the way it is working for at least 5-6 years\nReview after using it for couple of months\nPicture quality is good...but speakers are gone now....dont know what happened...audio quality and volume is like 50% less now. I never had to used it above 30% vol..but now..even at 70% vol is very low. Even my phone sounds louder than this now\nPathetic purchase",

Excellent display of 4k content with great contrast and quality\n\nAlthough slightly pricey when compared with other QLED counterparts like TCL, 1+ but can be justifiable for the amazing sound system offered (especially for 65\" - 48W output is awesome)",
            "Overall Good in this price range.\n1) Sound is awesome. 4.5 out of 5\n2) Picture quality is great. 4.8 out of 5\n3) Initially I also faced issue in Prime video, then I reset it on factory setting and updated application. Issue resolved.\n\nOverall fantastic smart 4k LED TV, very much comparable with big brands.",
            "After 20days suddenly the screen is not turning on . Power led is on, but when i try to on the tv it's get a blink in the screen and turning off again. I raised a complaint with flipkart.have to see what they going to do.I bought on the first sale day. The delivery was very quick ( one day delivery mine not being a metropolitan city) . Installation was also quick the very next day. I am satisfied with the picture quality and sound. Great value for money. Should look into durability and performance as the time pass. I see the tv is hanging some times and i have turn it off and again turn on the tv . I don't know whether it can be rectified by software updates. Any one facing the issue ?. The tv is a bit slow. It is hanging at moments.",

            "I have used for one & half months The Nokia TV absolutely do not have any problem it is one of the best buy. However, the remote consumes more energy as I have compelled to replace new battery cells with in a month and a half. The supplier is very good in keeping up the time of delivery, and responsive to the complaints I thank him for immediate reply and service. I recommend this product based on my usage and observation. Thanks for the supply of good product Flipkart.",
            "Delivery and Installation done earlier than the assured date. Thanks to flipkart delivery and installation team for the safe delivery .\nThe TV looks very beautiful and premium.\nDisplay is good and 4k contents looks very realistic , HD contents are good and SD contents are poor but its as expected .\nSound is fantastic , feels like we are inside the movie hall. No need for extra sound bar.However with software update the sound level has reduced. Hopefully the next update will take care of this issue.\nThe smart features like , night mode,music mode,sleep timer are really handy. Music mode is really handy i.e tv can be used as BT speaker with tv dispaly off and it saved my extra money on sound bar buy.\nPorts on the back side is bit difficult to reach when wall mounted , however its negligible issue.\nBluetooth , wifi , google voice command works without any issue.\nRemote controller is very minimalist and its manageable.\n\nSuggestion : If you are looking for the big screen with budget buy go for it .\ni have bought the extended warranty just in case if any issue arises and to be on safer side.\n\nThis is too early review, will update the review after couple of months !!!\nThanks for reading my feedback , stay home stay safe .",

Since i had an LG 55 inch before the picture clarity all around the tv was very impressive, so Nokia 55 inch tv you\u2019ll not get that flawless or impressive pic quality feel.

After comparing with Realme new Tech SLED and I found NOKIA is better in terms of sound/picture quality(what else you will expect from a TV) 4K video's in YouTube plays without any issue. We can verify when we have 4K channels available. Dual band Wi-Fi is missing. But connecting the Direct Connect cable should solve the problem, no lagging.AIDA64 shows 160dpi.But not sure if that's true.SD channels are not that great. HD channels working OK and you have to spend more money for the channels though. Google assistant works fine. They should have added YouTube/Prime buttons in the remote. Fast and smooth navigation is really good. Bluetooth headphones connects without any issue. But you have to come out to the settings to pair for the first time.

Even though single band wifi, it doesn't disappoint. If u have good Internet then it would play even 4k without any lag. After last updates sound issue is solved even at minimum points 5 or 6 fills the room .sound is loud and with good clarity. Only point in surround sound option bass reduces but stil it's good. For a normal person who just enjoy only songs videos wil be happy. There is no issue with casting and connectivity. Not sure of gaming as I don't use tv for this. Instead of zee5 hotkey , could have been for prime or YouTube.but it doesn't matter.",

The biggest benefit of this Nokia TV that it is a big screen and also a clear skin, no issue to play 4K clearly and vividly, sound quality is just awesome and beyond of all I ever experienced early before of this. I can say Nokia has returned market back with this TV after loosing market in Mobile it is may be a turning back..",

Bluetooth now connects and no voice break issues, however Bluetooth sound quality isn't great for movie watching, I can't explain but the voice quality looks like its dubbed.... but for normal videos, news, documentaries etc, it's fine.\n\nLetting my earlier review below as is, as people facing similar issue may find it useful. Thanks\n-------- old review below \u2014\u2014\u2014\nPicture quality is decent considering its price, however sound is not as great as the company claims about it's Onkyo speaker.\n\n1. Sound gets too loud even at 10-15% level and it goes from very low to very loud with just one level up. So too loud for night viewing. If u go low one level u won't hear the sound and one level above it will be too loud.\n\n2. Bluetooth headphones don't work properly with this tv. I have 3 Bluetooth headphones all work absolutely fine with my laptop, phone, pc and tablet but all 3 have major voice quality issues and connection keeps breaking. Basically you won't be able to use Bluetooth headphones at all. Calledi? customer service and they said its a known issue and they can't do anything about it.\n\nTo summerize, picture quality is decent and sound quality is also Ok not great but other sound/bluetooth related issues make the experience bad.",
            "This would definitely be one of the best purchase I've ever made.\nThe sound quality is simply too good. You can't get this sound even with a qled 1lacs worth of TV. The Onkyo Sound bar is too loud and clear and a great bass thump.\nThe tv has a music mode where the display switches off and just the music plays can be done even with youtube.\n\nThe best part is you can just connect it with your phone's bluetooth and play music even while keeping the screen off.\n\nOnly con I could find was \"missing the 5ghz wifi support\"",

But better if you take HD channels. screen cast work best befor update, but after the update,cast only work in default app that is fast cast , But YouTube, prime video, Spotify, Netflix, hotstar etc. It works very well in the cast.*If you are watching TV in a mid range for a big hall, then this TV is the best.* Compromise in a few pictures quality.",
            "Overall in this price range this tv seems to be a fair purchase.\n\nPositives:\n1. Usually people complain in budget tv's about brightness. I feel this one has enough to provide quality video output with good brightness.\n2. Onkyo sound bar on this tv is a very good addition. It provides better sound than any other in this price range.\n3. Looks premium\n\n\nNegatives:\n1.approximately 1% of times android user interface wither restarts or does not respond to remote control.\n2. Remote quality in not that great.\n3.

            "The name Nokia brought in old memories of their phone which I had used for long time. This however was the reason for me choosing the 65 inch Android TV.\nThe sound system is the strong point, it is distinctly clear. Rightly it was highlighted in the specification and even the label on the TV tells how important it is.\nThe price at which it was offered made it look like a loot. The TV is a right choice for those who are looking for a compact and affordable yet performing android TV",

Sound is good and loud. But I assume JBL (in 2019 model) is better.\n5. Premium look.\n6. Ports are on one side only.\n7. Super fast casting.\n\nCons:\n1. Nokia or Dixon handed over installation to one company who feels that they are the king in market. I don't like the professionalism of Jeeves team. Suggestion - please stand next to that full time when he install TV.\n\n2. 5Ghz band would be better but I purchased a 600 Rs. Lan cable with it and solved the problem.\n\nFinal verdict - A TV is primarily for viewing, don't go into the trap of Android10, memory size etc etc. This is good value for Money. If not this one, I recommend TCL or LG / Samsung",

The first time the WIFI didn't work and the second time they delivered a damaged TV where there was a dent in the screen. Finally, after 1 month I got the TV today(third one) and again there is damage in the screen. It was a small scratch and if I am going to ask for a replacement god knows when I am going to receive it again. Fed up with Flipkart and have decided to live with it. I told the technician the same. I won't recommend buying this TV and if you do, please check the screen carefully for dents and scratches. Ensure all the functionality works before the technician leaves your home. Getting a defective product once is something that can happen to anyone. Getting it three times in a row? Something is really wrong here.",

A single bar increase makes too loud and decrease makes inaudible. Device name cannot be set to your choice.

Wifi gets disconnected frequently. Even if I am using tv soundbar as a bluetooth speaker and connected from phone then also it disconnected after 4-5 songs which keeps irritating me. Apart from that sound is good but not that great as it hyped because it misses bass.Dont watch SD channels with this because it will look ugly.\nOverall i would rate this as a decent product in this segment.",

Picture quality is amazing. Good contrast and sharp imaging\n2. Design of the product along with sound quality is really good.\n3. It is a value for money product at INR 39K.\n\nCons:\n1. Software is slightly slow. Applications take more time to open\n2. Boot time is high\n3. Remote control could have been better with more functions. Connecting to Android TV remote brings connectivity issues.\n\nOverall, a good buy. Definitely recommended.",

Only one thing I feel that could've been better is the sound though it's not bad either but can be enhanced. You'll not get the TV in such price range for 55'TV.\n\nPicture quality - very Good\nSound quality - Good\nBezel view - very Good\nWiFi connectivity - awesome",

            "Wonderful",
            "After a month long research of 55 inch TVs where I evaluated the Motorola ZX pro, Hi sense, Toshiba, Blaupunkt etc I bought this during the July 21 sale. So it's been about two weeks of using the TV. Delivery was next day and install the day after. Having used an LEtv 55 and a Samsung FHD 55 before, I had some reference points to check this against in addition to my research. While it's a bit too early to comment, TV checks out fine as of now. WiFi connection is flawless. Not sure why people want 5Ghz when 2.4Ghz does the job perfectly. 4K video streams instantly and I have not noticed any buffering whatsoever. Android TV works flawlessly too and I have noticed no lag at all. As for the sound, the Onkyo speakers are superb.None of my other more established brand TVs have a sound this good. Colour reproduction is excellent and pictures pop out. There is a sheen/ sharpness in the pictures. I tried all HDMI ports and the USB ports and all works fine so far. I was able to connect a camera to the USB port and the downloaded Google Duo detected it perfectly. As for issues, there was a problem of the TV restarting by itself ( on rare occasions) which resolved upon resetting the TV. I would say for around 37K, it seems a good deal. I have taken extended warranty from Flipkart not knowing long term reliability. While the picture and sound are great, what I like more about the TV is the look of it when switched off. It is aesthetically pleasing with the fabric covered Onkyo sound bar at the bottom and almost bezel less screen it enhances the decor..It is quite thin too. Also, the viewing angles are great and the screen doesn't reflect light abnormally. Need to now see long term reliability. I would strongly recommend this TV..",
            "Sound is good for music , not for other. During music it will be laud and again very low",
            "Pros: LED panel is of excellent quality which provides excellent picture quality especially 4k videos .\nSound: high end QuatroX Onkyo speakers delivers 3d sound, connectivity is also good. No problem,\nRemote is also working properly.\n\nCons: till now no problem",

            "To anybody who is reading this, please don't be lured by the competitive pricing of this TV as you will surely regret your purchase after the initial couple of months.\n\nThis TV suffers from really bad software, and even worse service.\n\n1) The UI lags while doing basic things such as scrolling apps on the home screen even out of the box.\n\n2) The customer service is the worst you will ever experience. The TV is branded by Nokia, the support is provided by Flipkart and the Service is done by this delivery partner Jeeves. So don't be fooled by Nokia's brand value. My product in particular started having wifi connectivity issues within the first 6 months of my purchase. My TV would randomly disconnect from the internet and just not connect back. I tried factory reset, multiple routers and every other possible solution provided to me over phone but to no effect. It was even accepted by the company that the product provided to me has a faulty motherboard. It has been 4 months since I have been facing this issue at the day of writing this review but the defect on my TV has still not been rectified. I write mails and call the customer support and all they say is \"we will get back to you within 10 days\" which has taken 4 months.\n\n3) Not even a year, receiving a product with a faulty motherboard and no resolution from the company for 4 months. In fact, this product is not even made by Nokia. The product is manufactured by Flipkart itself and is merely marketed by Nokia. Further, they have an external service team Jeeves that is just not good enough and fail to do their job.\n\nI am stuck with this product, having already wasted my money on this. I hope this review is read by prospective buyers and even save one person from wasting their money on a sub-standard product.",

Yeah, I accept there are issue with bluetooth connectivity some times considering its price and other specs it is nothing.

I did not face any issue with connectivity as some people given commneg about this points. Nokia TV able to create ambience of small theater. I loved this TV. Only draw back is Nokia is not having their own engines for installation and has to depend on Jeeves. The problem with Jeeves guy is they try to finish the installation asap and try to leave as they have large of instalation to finish. So they don't spend much time with you. Nokia should have their own engineers for their product . Any way this is not much negative. At last I am fully impressed with Nokia TV. One can go for it without second thought.",

Sound is crisp.\n3. Connectivity is good.\n4. Android tv experience is best felt without any problem.\n\nCons:\n1. After the update, everyone commented about sound to be reduced. I felt the same. Hope it will be rectified with another update.\n2. If you compare QLED/OLED/ Sony high end tvs with this, you won't find the darkest color what they produce. Of course the technology is different and price wise they are providing much better tv panel. So you can ignore this con.\n3. I faced google assistant to be not working for once. Which got handled by resetting the tv.\n\nFinal verdict:\n\nThis is the best budget 4k tv for those who like to binge watch a lot. Price wise this is a good tv which comes with onkyo soundbar fitted. One small suggestion to take 3 years warranty from Flipkart which can be handy in future.",

The design, sound and picture is awesome in this price range. Viewing HD content and listening music is awesome with option to switch off display.

Very clear and not too much bass resulting in very clear sound output. So a big thumbs up to team Nokia and Onkyo. Just don\u2019t expect that this will be sufficient for party music.\n\nAlso, wish the installation guys were a bit professional, they didn\u2019t want to set up the tv and explain basic functions.

Initially Rs 3750 as a discount. But at time of delivery they said there is problem in display and ask to pay 2100.\nWhich is not Fair. My tv was in good condition and they should cheat customer like this.\n\nPicture\nQuality is very good. 4k video is play superb. SD channel does not look good with DTH. You need HD channel to enjoy viewing experience.\n\nBluetooth\nConnection is good. I had connect Boult ear phone Which connect . Though time taken for connection is little more but it's ok.\n\nBoot time\nBoot time is 1 minute 15 sec. Which I think is more. There is time when full tv is black for 4 to 5 sec during boot. But don't worry. It will boot and finish boot.\n\nSound\nBefore update of Tv which we receive on 24th Oct. Sound was very loud. Before updated i use to keep 10 to 15% which was enough to see Movie and it was loud.\nBut now after update of TV i need to keep sound 50%.\nI hope Nokia will provide new updated which will solve above issue.\nBut when you watch setup box you need to keep volume to 40 to 50%\n\nChromecast is very good. No lagg what so ever.\n\nMirrorcast\nFast cast app is not good. There is lagg while playing video from your phone. It play for some time and after that it stop and again start.\nBut while projecting photos there is lag of 1 sec.\nThey need to resolve it or use some other app.\n\nWhile watching movie TV was reboot automatically and this happened 2 times. I hope it will not happen after updated which is received today.\n\nSo overall TV is good and I recommend to other to buy.\nI will update you after 15 days. If any change happen.\n\n#updated after 4 month usage#\nI had seen if we are watching youtube on tv and we switched off tv from remote (not power off from main plug). Now if again switch on. YouTube get hang ,you will not see any pictures or any side menu. Each time I had to clear the catch file to view the youtube or switch off tv from main source.\n\nAlso if we are watching tv and WiFi get disconnected. So even after WiFi is restore tv doesn't connect automatically. We have do it manually.\nNokia need to send updated so this problem doesn't appear",
