Delivery was promt and got the tv fixed on the same day itself. Even though it says 16w speakers sound clarity is really good. 4k movies are awesome.

            "Its My third Android TV after Marq and TCL.\nI habe purchased 43\" TV and I am giving review after using it for almost 2 days.\n\nPROS :-\n(1) Display is crystal clear and crispy, colour enhancement is just awesome. You can watch HD videos and ultra HD (4K) video on it and you will fall in love.\n\n(2) Design of this TV is just beautiful. It has really low bezels which give your TV viewing just stunning.\n\n(3) Sound quality is very good, TV has 16 watt speakers which is more than sufficient for a big bedroom or a hall.\nDolby Atmos and Tru Surround Sound system working perfectly on this TV. You can turn your TV into home theatre by using Dolby Atmos.\n\n(4) Android OS 10 makes your TV smooth like butter. You can use any app, play any type of videos without a single glitch.\n\n(5) Boot time is real fast in this TV. Just plug and play.\n\n(6) Value for money. I have searched for almost 10 days and I found COOCAA TV the best among all the brands in this price range. This is the cheapest 4K smart TV in the market.\n\n\nCONS -\n\n(1) Display brightness is too bright which can cause a little watery eyes. You should adjust the viewing distance.\n\n(2) Remote is old style and its too big. Remote is unnecessarily big.\n\nThats All Guys. Over all its the best in market purchase. You can compare yourself and I guarantee you won't find anything best than that.",
            "Best picture quality, as well as good sound quality. No need of any extra speakers in a room. Best in this price segment.",

            "Awesome, simply awesome in this price range, I had purchased in the last electronic days sale for Rs. 23999. Ecart deliver before estimated date, the packaging was pretty good, but got 2-3 days for installation, the technician was rescheduled installation time without my consent or without intimation, but after the 1st look I was speechless.\nI am very happy that I had done a good deal by not purchasing a QLED or OLED.",
            "I would like to tell all the Flipkart customer & commen customer on Flipkart that cooca 50 Inch tv very nice and technical bid good \ud83d\ude0a I'm happy with product\nThere is nothing next to all the other well known tv company product tv I say clearly mentioned the Samsung tv, Onida tv,LG tv, Sony TV, Thomas tv,MI tv, all other tv there is nothing next to them & never compare...\nEvery thing thing is same software & technical bid\nI. Say to the personally that is the TV request to buy",
            "Quite happy with this purchase. Quick delivery, a very polite staff from Jeeves for installation and had it up and running in less than 48 hours.\nThe TV has a reasonably good picture quality and features. Use it mostly as an alternate TV in guest room for HD Cable and Netflix/Prime all of which work and look fine.\nAll in all a good budget buy.",
            "Very Good Product in this Category with this price.\nOnly thing is HDMI(ARC) missing.\n\nIt is Skyworth subsidiary company which is world top most tv manufacturer from long time.\n\nMy suggestion is take Complete Protection cover.",
            "Good product within this price range. Picture quality, sound quality as well as connectivity is very good. Only issue is that google assistant not working with my remote. other wise i am happy with this product",

Best picture quality\n\n3.Bit improvement required at Sound part, not that great\n\n4. Superb Value for money, with the same features it is very hard to get 55 inch TV @32999 (apart from Bank discount) in any shopping portal",
            "Average product.\nPicture quality is not so good so is the sound.Connectivity is ok. What is attractive is the price. I got it for Rs.20500.00. At this price I should not expect a picture screen like that of Samsung. Overall it is ok. After using for about a month I observe it is good 4k tv.",
            "The best 43 inches tv in the budget, dont think about anything the picture quality of the product is far more better than many brands. And the audio output is average as it is 18w but it is enough for a medium room and viewing angles are so good and latest android what else you can expect on a budget smart tv\u2764\ufe0f\nGo for it without any second thought\nDefinitely you will love the product for sure\u2764\ufe0f\nThankyou flipkart and cooca for delivering for a wonderful prodcut\ud83d\udc9b",

            "Got it on the BBD sale, at 28K.\nBest in terms of quality.\nEasy to operate, punchy colors, good brightness level, good contrast.\n\nOnly the thing is disappointing, it does not have dual WIFI which I guess is a must but it won't affect much, as 4K videos play flawlessly by the 2.4 GHZ wifi speed (support 60 MBPS)",
            "Considering price picture, sound, BT, internet connectivity is awesome - obviously not like samsung and sony but it's good for everyday use\n\nThe best thing is it's performance, UI is fluide and very fast no lag seen whatsoever.\n\nOnly fear is it's long term usage and after sale service",
            "Just vow!! Seamless android and Google integration. Everything works like a charm. Metal back at this price is not available in other brands. Good ergonomic TV remote. Thin bezels, Vivid bright display panel. Movie watching experience is awesome. Sound quality is good and loud enough for a big living room. More importantly quality of sound is very good. This TV is actually same as Motorola TV minus the 60W sound. Pretty satisfied to buy this at 33K after a month long search. Full paisa vasool purchase.",

            "I have searched the Internet for budget 4K TV and I was going to buy VU or Nokia but then I got a video on coocaa and then I got to know about it.\n\nThe features are far far better in budget as well as premium brands.\n\nYou have few settings in sound menu post which you will love the sound quality believe me you will be amazed with the bass and clarity from just 16 watts of speakers\n\nPicture quality is awesome with 2gb RAM and 32 GB storage space what else you can ask.\n\nThe only negatives is the size of remote everything else is super awesome.\n\nOne day delivery and same day installation just made my Diwali super awesome thanks Flipkart\n\nPlease buy extended warranty while purchasing this TV for complete peace of mind",

Definitely a good choice as a second TV.",
            "Ordered on 8th May 2021, Received the Product on 9th May 2021 and the installation was completed on same day. Thanks Flipkart and Jeeves for the fast Delivery and installation.\n\nThe Installation team (Jeeves) was friendly and helpful. Product is awesome and has a zing look to it. I missed taking the additional 2 year warranty from Flipkart during the ordering process and the same was offered by Jeeves at a little bit extra. Bezels are thin on 3 sides but yeah still visible, UI is fast and responsive.\n\nWill add to the review after a couple of months.",
            "4K TV at this price range is awesome. Great video and audio quality. No issues with connectivity (need to install app for casting,).

            "A highly satisfying product as seen over the last 10 days. It delivers in picture & sound quality as it promises. So no issues; thats why it deserves 5* rating.\nWere it supported with an elaborate users manual, printed or online, would make it less time consuming to Learn the usage for full functionality. The product brochure enclosed, or the one in the TV menu, are extremely cryptic/ deficient in operating instructions. For example : even after spending much time, I hv not been able to find mode for converting screen aspect from 16:9 to 4:3.\nOverall, it is value for money with the best specs in this category at the most economical price.",
            "Worth every penny you send!\n\nPicture quality: is amazing. 4K HDR videos look gorgeous. 43 inch size is well suited for medium size rooms. The best feature of the tv for the price you pay.\n\nHardware: absolute value for money. 2gb RAM, 32GB storage is boon. Can install lot of stuff. Games as well. Built is all round plastic though. Stand is plastic. Can't expect premium build for the price. Bezels are thin though so you will enjoy watching movies in this. Sound is 16 watt which is obviously low. Again can't expect more for the price, in the price range maximum you can get us 20 watts so not a negative for the TV. Chrome cast works like a charm, you can cast from phone, laptop, tab, smooth casting. Prime, Netflix, YouTube work as usual, You get option to play 4K video. You get decent controls to change sound, picture quality in the menu. TV is bright and doesn't feel low on brightness. All ports work nicely, you get one port with HDMI arc support, it is not eARC though. Google assistant work fine.\n\nSoftware: android 10 does the job well. In built OS can play majority of file types from external hard drive and pen drives. For some formats which it can't play just install 3rd party app from playstore.\n\nRemote: full size. No minimal design, but get all the controls. It's a bluetooth and not optical so no need to point at the tv. You get Netflix, prime video, YouTube and Google Play dedicated buttons. Google assistant button is additional as well. I like this remote more than MI (my dad had Mi tv).",
