Obviously they cant set up the TV by themselves and was dependent on the SONY technicians visit. As per the initial plan they were supposed to setup it up after 3 days of the delivery. But surprisingly they came the very next day and have set it up. Thank you team.\nComing to the TV by itself, so far so good. Will update more after setting up Internet and use the smart features. Presently our parents cant setup the internet, though they have a modem. They need assistance, and so we will wait for the smart TV setup and give more details here :)",
