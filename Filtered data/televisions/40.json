            "I purchased this OnePlus TV yesterday. The picture quality is immaculate as well as the sound quality. The brightness and color contrast of the TV is amazing. The installation for the stand setup can be done by yourself as it is pretty simple. Operating the TV is very user-friendly and connecting to wireless platforms like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are simple. Overall performance is brilliant and the price tag is justified. Outstanding job by OnePlus.",
            "Best\nFor money and super quality that oneplus has given customer support is very good quick installation not expected delivery within 2 days so very best and the equality of the TV is also best the picture and clarity of the TV is also very good and sound quality is likely differ with various songs on the standard mode",
            "On 17th June 2021 received the ONEPLUS U1S 55 inch smart TV. The delivery person delivered carefully and packaging is intact.\nOn next day (18-6-2021) installing done( by 11.30 am) and demo shown by service personal who is very well knowledgeable in fitting TV to wall mount and giving demo.\nIn this model both wall mount and stand was Included by ONEPLUS. I used wall mount.\nUsed TV all day and giving this review.\nUsed 4k setup box and jio net. Saw Avengers-end game.\nI observed that if content is Dolby then we can have dolby sound just like in theatre.\nSound quality is superb. At low volume(30 in TV) and 2 in setup box I enjoyed Dolby effect while watching the Avenger movie. No need of external Dolby speakers, if want can use...result will enhanced Dolby effect.\nI didnot change picture settings and used company settings, excellent picture quality.\nHD content is superb and non-HD content is okay.\nSound and picture quality us excellent for live channels.\nAfter 14 days of using the tv, one excellent feature Oneplus U1S tv has is, when turn off setup box after few minutes screen will turn displaying scenes(as in case oof samsung frame tv)",
            "No second thoughts.. just go for it\n\nWhat you need in TV big screen, good resolution, good picture quality with good sound quality. All this version have.

            "Awesome picture quality, great sound and truly a great experience of watching TV, only con is that there is lag sometimes which I believe can be fixed with updates , rest it is the best TV in this price range..",
            "1. Software is very lagging, remote response is worst. Ratting : 1/5\n2. View angle: OnePlus team have not given importance for the viewing angel. Ratting 1/5\n3. Wifi connectivity: very worst even sometimes if you keep the near to the tv it shows moderate coverage. Ratting: 1/5\n4. Sound quality: Dolby sound effects are good with in-built speakers, but for voice and dialogues worst to hear. Ratting 1/5.\n5. Gama engine: when you watch 4k scenes with fast action or frames you couldn't experience the smooth frame. The ultra smooth algorithm just breaking the smooth frame experience. Ratting:3/5\n6. Display brightness: little bit importance to brighter could have improved the picture quality > 350 nits Ratting : 3/5\n\nOverall Ratting : 2/5.\nFlipkart Ratting : 3/5.\n\nMy personal advice is go for samsung with little more money you get the awesome experience. And showroom buy always better for electronic products. You can experience and buy the product.\n\n*Flipkart return policy ratting: 1/5*",
            "Amazing product with good picture quality and clarity....\n\nFlipkart fast deliver and installation was a great add on... (You change change the date of installation to near date after the TV has been shipped)\n\nDon't think twice before buying this TV !!!\n\nDetail overview will update after week time usage.",
            "Overall the TV is good and depicts awesome picture quality. The operation is easy and quite responsive .\nHowever the only thing which I felt bad about it was lower sound levels i.e. it's not that loud and audible range is above 60.",

            "1. Software is very lagging, remote response is worst. Ratting : 1/5\n2. View angle: OnePlus team have not given importance for the viewing angel. Ratting 1/5\n3. Wifi connectivity: very worst even sometimes if you keep the near to the tv it shows moderate coverage. Ratting: 1/5\n4. Sound quality: Dolby sound effects are good with in-built speakers, but for voice and dialogues worst to hear. Ratting 1/5.\n5. Gama engine: when you watch 4k scenes with fast action or frames you couldn't experience the smooth frame. The ultra smooth algorithm just breaking the smooth frame experience. Ratting:3/5\n6. Display brightness: little bit importance to brighter could have improved the picture quality > 350 nits Ratting : 3/5\n\nOverall Ratting : 2/5.\nFlipkart Ratting : 3/5.\n\nMy personal advice is go for samsung with little more money you get the awesome experience. And showroom buy always better for electronic products. You can experience and buy the product.\n\n*Flipkart return policy ratting: 1/5*",
            "Amazing product with good picture quality and clarity....\n\nFlipkart fast deliver and installation was a great add on... (You change change the date of installation to near date after the TV has been shipped)\n\nDon't think twice before buying this TV !!!\n\nDetail overview will update after week time usage.",
            "Overall the TV is good and depicts awesome picture quality. The operation is easy and quite responsive .\nHowever the only thing which I felt bad about it was lower sound levels i.e. it's not that loud and audible range is above 60.",
            "So good 65 inch tv. So happy experience \ud83d\udc4d\n\nSound quality is good and picture quality good. Almost good experience\n\ud83d\udc4c",
            "Amazing TV. Returned Redmi TV and bought this one. Sound is too good, even better than Motorola revou sound which has a soundbar. There is a lag issue at times. Otherwise I think it's the best TV in this budget. Wouldn't buy any other tv in this price. Sound awesome. Picture is too good. Even has global dimming option.\nCons: Doesn't have Dolby Vision as well as Dolby Atmos. But HDR10+ is too good. Go for it.",
            "Everything is wonderful. Oneplus made wonderfully this product. Ram is 2 GB and ROM is 16 GB. The display is fabulous. The sound quality is astonishing to me. Unexampled viewing angle from the side angle too. WIFI connectivity is very fast and smooth. In this price segment, oneplus made an unprecedented job.",

            "Everything is good in this TV, nice picture quality, good sound, and app support.\nHowever there are few cons:\n1. Software is laggy.\n2. Start time is little more\n3. Sound output is variable in different apps. You will have to increase or decrease sound according to app. Especially in Hotstar, it is very low.\n\nI hope it will be helpful.",
            "Amazing product with good picture quality and clarity as well as the sound quality.",
            "Great one! I using this Tv for 4 days .Picture Quality was awesome ..Dolby vision is not big matter on tv ..Good connectivity .\nOnly negative thing is Sound Quality needs to be improved by external sources like home theatre .,etc\n\nInstallation was professional and 4K videos are running good ..Slight lagging is there ..It should be improved by software updating it seems .",
            "I recently purchased this OnePlus Smart Android TV from flipkart, after a lot of research I finally decided to buy my first OnePlus TV. After using it for a week now I am very very happy with the product quality. The video quality is really very very good and even the sound output is impressive. The over all user experience is very good. Software is also smooth and responsive. Thanks to flipkart for super quick delivery and installation.",
            "Once gain as a most preferred brand one plus doesn't disappoint, however few updates and improvements will make this tv a best choice.\n\n1. SOUND - definitely a lot of improvement can be made as Audio 5.1 is not very clear in all the apps such as Netflix, hotstar, prime etc so manually have to change based on the output. In one app audio 5.1 is loud but in other it's not the same it varies. So hope this can be fixed from one plus side.\n\n2. Software- sometimes I'm noticing a lag and even the screen gets struck when you press volume and then you try to pause the video or click on back button all in a very fast manner. Hope the response time and this glitch would be fixed in the next update.\n\n3. Voice interface - this is not very effective, either in voice search as well as Google assistant.\n\n4. The remote function - sometimes there is a lag and tv remote and functions doesn't work like volume and back button, prompt response is kind of missing sometimes. Hoping this could be fixed in the next uodate from oneplus.",
            "I recently purchased this OnePlus 65 inch 4K Android TV from flipkart. Firstly I want to thank flipkart for super quick delivery and installation of the TV. After watching it for a while now I can say that this is the best 4K TV I have ever seen. It provides best value for money with great build quality and premium design. The user interface is also fast and responsive.",
            "Good tv experience, Flipkart delivery is good but installation is after the 10 days it is very pathetic. Jeeves should look into it seriously.\nAbout TV\nGood Picture Quality\nGood Viewing angles\nThe sound also good but sometimes not able to header clear dialogs\n4K is lagging initially but it playing super fine now\n\nCons-\nRemort is lagging some time e.g increase decrease sound\n\nMay be software update fix it",
            "Super tv in this price range picture clarity is awesome and sound also good I'm full happy one plus 55inch buying this tv",
            "Review: After 18 days of use, here are some points would like to share.\nPicture quality is good but not the best\nSound could be better, there is still scope of improvements, software issue, tv hangs sometimes while using the remote, TV is getting shutdown automatically sometimes, still observing, it could be power fluctuation problem, but can't say now, internet connectivity, Bluetooth connectivity, chromecast all works well. ONE+ needs to work on the software and sounds quality",
            "Very good Product...simple to use and software availablity is so so good...if you need big tv with good value go for it. Picture quality is good .but sound quality is need improvement. Some times quality of sound is very poor. If you able to buy a sound bar or speakers blindly go for this tv",
            "Review after 2week of use age : 65 inch one plus tv\nFirstly i was sceptical weather to buy a 55inch or a 65 inch tv. Finally went for 65 inch and trust me it was a right decision made. At a viewing distance of approx 8-9ft the viewing experience out of the world. So blindly go for 65 inch.\n\nBuild quality of the tv is very very good. Looks very premium.\n\nPicture quality is good, worth the money.\n\nSound quality is good but volume could have been better. Doesn\u2019t matter for me since i use home theatre system.\n\nThe software works great and smooth with frequent android updated every now and then. Haven\u2019t installed much apps since i use apple tv along.\n\nI would recommend this 65 inch tv for anyone looking for a theatre like experience with limited budget. You will definitely enjoy it.\n\nRegarding delivery and installation: It was delivered the very next day and installation was done in next 24 hours.\n\nOverall happy with the experience.",
            "Hands free voice command don't works well.and when 4k video is played it got stuck after every 2 to 3 minutes.Netflix series is all seems red when played.lg led 50 inch is far better choice that costs around 44000.",
            "Amazing tv just go for it\nwithout thanking anything picture quality is best and sound is amazing loved it",
            "Not a worthy brand in Big size tvs. I would recommend to prefer Nokia instead of Oneplus TVs.\n\nSoftware is always logging.\nScreen is flickering sometimes\nSound is not good",
            "Outstanding picture quality, the details and color production is top notch\u2764\ufe0f, the only draw back is that the screen bleeding from sides, its like the black aren't deep and light leaks from edges and and that doesn't look good in my opinion if the screen playing darker scenes, about the sound quality sound quality is decent dont really expect anything Greater, if u are a music freak you will need a music system. Now the softwares, softwares are quite laggy and choppy, the screen freezes time to time.\nAnd its not good, one plus should focus on that, overall its a good buy if u get the 55inch tv in under 40-45k its a good buy otherwise dont buy it.",
            "Nice product. For sure better than other budget brands. Better than few samsung tv models as well",
            "Truly bezel-less, no border visible externally. Vibrant picture, yet multiple settings to configure to your best settings. Very soothing to eyes, even in high contrast pictures - thanks to auto-brightness control.\nVery slim, comes with a good wall hanging set-up. Nice colours, nice sound too. For normal conditions do not have to increase more than 25, yet 100 does not disperse the sound. The surround sound is awesome.\nThe only drawback observed is, there is a lag in remote control operation and TV response, especially when watching Netflix. Otherwise works like a charm. The \"OK Google\" feature is awesome too.\nBut damn Flipkart, very bad customer service. There was a free gift of OnePlus Budz with this TV. I had to follow up more than a week to get it, after the return policy period. Calling customer care was not enough, had to complain on Twitter. I would recommend if you face any issues with Flipkart, complain in twitter, they work much faster there rather than calling customer care.",
            "OnePlus U1S 50inch TV does perform well and has a few extra bells and whistles like far-field mics and good audio quality, but similar sized Dolby Vision-compliant TVs can be purchased for less.\n\nGood Stuff:\n\nGood picture with HDR10+ support\n\nImpressive sound output\n\nHDMI 2.1 ports with support for eARC\n\nDual-band Wi-Fi\n\nAccess to picture and sound adjustments on the fly\n\nFar-field mics for hands-free voice commands\n\nRuns on Android TV 10\n\nBad Stuff:\n\nNo Dolby Vision support\n\nNo analog audio output\n\nPorts are hard to reach",

One thing we faced is side viewing angle issue. When looking from side it is not feel like LED, feels like old lcd panel.",
            "The TV is great in terms of audio and video, the only issue was One Plus interface which is laggy, and sometimes takes more than a second to respond. Though on disabling all the animations the performance eases up with swift app switching but that\u2019s a bug. Overall the TV is a must buy if you can live without the fuzzy android UI animations and want a better visual/audio experience than its counterparts (MI, Vu, or similar).",
            "1. Tv remote can't be paired with set top box remote. Means you need 2 remotes always. Tv power control and volume control can be only through tv remote\nPower button of the remote has 3 functions sleep, power off and o2 mode.\nOther TVs we can download remote app on our smart phones. Here the app is not good\n2. Normally tv ac operating voltage shall be rated for 230v and SMPS takes care of variation from 90 to 270 volts.\nIn this tv max voltage is 240 volts and the company advises customers to buy ac stabilizer at an extra cost.\nSo customers must buy ac stabilizer as voltage fluctuates sometimes above 250\nthis may cost about 3000 rs. additional cost\n3..picture pre defined settings like vivid etc are not as effective as in Panasonic, sanyo or sony\n4. Picture sharpness and clarity is not that good as in Panasonic. SD channels picture quality pretty bad.\n5. Panasonic gives two remotes one for tv viewing other for internet viewing. Here only one small remote.\n6. Sound is clear but not as good as panasonic\n7. One plus store sells the same tv for 2000 rs less than flipkart. It's not fair.",

            "It's a good product.The exchange program really helped us to buy this TV.Thanks Flipkart.The delivery agent, installation guy and the product are awesome.Good packaging by the one plus company.To enjoy the full outcome of tv you should have a high speed wifi.Its awesome to watch the 4k videos.Normal SD channels are also gud to view.The sound should be the problem if you are in a hall, however tv company itself advise you to buy a soundbar for theatre experience.",
            "Week 1 Review;\nSound quality is very good at this price range. Ideal for a bedroom size.\nPicture quality is not something you can say is Wow. But still delivers good images and clarity. Cannot compare with higher premium brands like Sony.\nOperating system seems lagging/slow/stuck or seems confused sometimes to remote press commands.\nHands free (Speak Now) is very impressive.\nOverall I would give a 7 /10",
            "I bought OnePlus 65 inch TV. This TV\u2019s picture quality is immaculate as well as the sound quality. The brightness and color contrast of the TV is amazing. The installation for the stand setup can be done by yourself simple. Operating the TV is very user-friendly and connecting to wireless platforms like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are simple. Overall performance is brilliant and the price tag is justified. Outstanding job by OnePlus. it is pretty. For installation took too much time.",
            "Overall a great product from interface, screen, sound, build and price perspective for an average user. However, I sometimes find that the software hangs when switching between apps and the color turns orangish when viewing warm colored scenes. I hope that these gets fixed with a software update. The remote is quite user friendly, but I feel the need for a dedicated inputs button as it has quite a few options behind the TV to connect stuff. However, i'm quite satisfied with my purchase.",

            "The TV is okay but flipkart service was worst. Following reviews are based on my 3+ months of usage. It's an IPS panel with decent viewing angle and brightness. The software leaves a lot to be desired. It freezes occasionally when in regular use. Hopefully OnePlus will release a future OTA update. The Google assistant feature is as useless as it can be and you'll end up using it less. Tuned by Dynaudio i.e. the audio feature is gimmick at best. Sound quality is normal but loud. Connectivity is fine, sometimes struggles with casting but it's nothing serious. Finally, it took more than 25 days for flipkart to arrange for installation after delivery and it just ruined the overall experience. Overall it's a decent TV with latest functionality but what matters the most in a TV is the picture quality and that is just okay.",

Had gone through several searches regarding this issue and got to know that it is caused due to the nearby electric devices and lack of space for the airflow. But in our case there is more than enough place for the airflow, hence made sure that no electric devices are much near for the TV unit. After the adjustments, since 10 days I didn't notice any green lines flickering. Hope it will never occur again.\nOther than that overall experience is Very Good.\nComing to the sound, do not worry about the sound and \"take the question will it be sufficient?\" out of your thought and after purchase you won't regret purchasing it. I too had same doubt at the time of purchase but everyone in the home were more than satisfied with this product. It's too good for the output they are providing. Dolby Atmos support works really fine and makes diffence while watching movies.\nI would have given 4.5 accept for that flickering issue as it occurs with most products but there is no option for 4.5 and it deserves more than 4 hence 5 out of 5.\n& Finally about shipping, Ekart had done very fine job with this & package was delivered As it should be.\nNote:- OnePlus Connect app is a must use with many features it surely enhanced the user experience of Android TV and thanks for keeping aside the regular ir remote, the Bluetooth Remote is an added bonus.

Fluctuations and need to have remote handy because you will have to increase and decrease volumes because it\u2019s not consistent. It is very frustrating and annoying .\nInstallation they took 2100 for wall mount I felt it\u2019s little costly and this doesn\u2019t come along with TV.\nSo this TV would have deserved 5 starts had it speakers were little more efficient.",

If its there, then I am not able to access it. I could just experience one connection at a time for soundbars via bluetooth.\nIt is really simple to operate using remote or androids.\nIt is slightly more than a month from TV has arrived and everything is working very well.\nI would suggest everybody to go for it if you are interested in this TV.",

So I ordered this TV, because it supported 5 GHz band and has 2 years warranty on thr panel (Otherwise the Nokia was excellent).\n\nCompared to the Nokia, the sound is not as loud, but I can hear voices more clearly. So overall it's better if you are not into loud music.\n\nPicture quality is excellent (honestly I find most modern TVs excellent). But the peak brightness is not very high. My living room has a big glass wall, so I have to keep panel brightness at 100%, and still it is a bit lower than required. On my Nokia, I had to keep it around 50%.",

It can be a secondary tv, for personal rooms and for gaming.\nPicture quality and sound are good no doubt. But the processor is very slow, has quite a few glitches (may improve with updates), it cannot handle 4k videos very well.",

It shows low hdr support on some apps. My oneplus tv unit has white color dead led on screen. The surround sound is the worst and It needs improvement. The sound on hotstar movies is too low and one of the worst in terms of dolby 5.1 sound.",
