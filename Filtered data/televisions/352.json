Coz deyve already installed YouTube WhatsApp Netflix n few more apps like dis including FB. Need a smart air mouse remote to scroll bw d pages of dese apps n sites. In d provided normal remote v can't scroll down or up. Can type letters thru Android keyboard on screen but it's annoying to move to each cursor n den press it. Yes for dis price wat u get is gud. But even still I suggest u guys to go for a normal 32inch hd tv for 13.5k or something n buy a Android box or smart box separately n plug it. Ur normal tv ll b smart. May b more smarter... Also to use proper Facebook n Netflix or any other app, u need to buy a seperate air mouse. It's not included in d box. A very big con...\n\nedited after jus 2.5yrs of use.\nit's been 2.5yrs now. today my tv s display's not workin... is dis d quality of kodak? seriously? a tv for jus 2.5yrs? i purchased dis on July of 2017. n u guys plz don't fall for dis cheap product. m sayin it frm my own experience. bought dis as it launched on Flipkart for 17.5k. now it's utter waste . d display s gone. only sound s coming.",

Maximum 48hrs are enough to dispatch, Flipkart should look into this.\nPros:\n1. Mirror feature for phone using miracast app working fine without lag.\n( Only Jio TV app does not allow to miracast. rest Jio apps like Jio Cinema and others are working fine )\n2. Anti glare protection.\n3. 2 USB ports & 2 HDMI.\n4. Good User Interface\n5.All smart tv features.\n6. RAM:1GB , Storage 8GB\n7. Low power consumption 48W\n8.

Shows 4gb free space on the internal storage is available but fails to update a 50mb Facebook app update saying storage isnt sufficient. Cant install more than 5 additional apps even with 4gb of available space. Wifi is weak. I can get two or more bars on rest of the devices but the tv fails to pick up wifi unless the signal is very strong. The supplied remote fails to perform many functions such as scrolling is impossible on some apps even with the mouse function and you have to use an external mouse with a scroll wheel to scroll down. The mouse function on ths remote is extremely slow. 2 hdmi and 2 usb is a good thing. Is on android KitKat with zero updates since i bought this. The screen got black dots after 6 months and needed replacing. Had to send the tv back to delhi. Pik up Was arranged by kodak but packaging had to b done by me, so dont throw away the box it comes in in case u have to return.",

            "M writing this review after using this TV for 3 days. Picture quality is good and sound is also reasonable at this price range.\nOne thing that I encountered is this TV does not support Dollby Digital HDMI sound output for HD channels of Tata sky STB.\n\nAlso Jeeves guy who came to install the television convinced me somehow that the HDMI cable given from Tata Sky STB does not work with the Kodak LED TV. Instead they have brought one HDMI cable with them and insisted to use that cable for better performance. They charged 600 bucks for that HDMI cable and later on I checked the TV with my old HDMI cable and its just working fine. There is no such issue instead they just charged an additional 600 bucks for that same cable. This is totally unprofessional and I think people should be aware of this so that they are not fooled.",

Just because it was mentioned that installation was the very next day thats why I fell in their trap. After I brought the TV, it said that installation will take 6-7 days. When I called Flipkart they kept telling me that installation usually takes 2-7 days and it cannot happen immediately. If you notice even now the seller has mentioned the installation date as very next day of delivery. Now flipkart is allowing the seller to quote wrong information on the product page not realising that this can land them into a legal soup also as they are not delivering whats promised before buying. They are changing their terms after the product is brought which is 100% illegal as per the contract law.",
