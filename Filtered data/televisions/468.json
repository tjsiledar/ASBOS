            "Excellent LED TV. purchased it on 17/10/19 evening, got it delivered on next day at 10 am, just after one hour rec'd a call for installation, based on my convenience one Mr. Vishwanth Reddy visited our home at 3.00 pm. He is an excellent installation engineer, finished his work very neat and fast, explained the functionalities of the TV too. first of all a big five star for the delivery of Flipkart and the excellent service of Jeeves the service partner.\n\nAbout TV, now I used it for 3 days, I can say it is par with any other branded TV's, I am using a Samsung TV at home, definitely I can compare it with the same. video upscaling is very good, hd contents looks super, 4k videos are just like live vision, black background is pure black, may be the direct lighting a+ panel helps it. color reproduction is excellent. Sound is pretty good, but I use a home theatre connected through the SPDIF port. Dolby clarity is amazing. Overall I am very happy with the product.",
            "I have Purchased 50\" model on 1st June 2020 and it has delivered to me on 4th June with installation same day.\nTruly speaking after one week, if you are looking for a budget smart TV then this is Fabulous TV. Picture quality, sound, Wi-Fi connectivity is truly awesome. I also took help of Flipkart reviews before ordering TV but yes now I totally believe on Flipkart and TV brand TCL iFFalcon...\nOnly one note- If you do not have HD channel set top box then please get it to feel the masterpiece experience... Normal channel other than HD also run smoothly but the effect and experience of HD is ultimate.",
            "Update after 20 months: TV is great. it lacks nothing. working fine.\nThis TV is great so far. It's been 10 days since installation. PQ is great. 4k is brilliant. 1080p is also very good. sd is bad, but nowadays except for some news channels nothing is in sd. SQ is also good considering that these kind of slim TVs can't have better speakers. 4k on YouTube, Netflix etc works perfectly on my wifi. all the apps are working perfectly. never once did I have to restart my tv or any app . voice commands are good. bluetooth connectivity is good . Prime Video is downloadable from official Play Store.\ncons : cricket is unwatchable due to image shaking while camera is panning. all other sports are ok. even football is good. watching sd content is bad. it being a VA panel, colors start to wash out as viewing angle increases. not a problem if you watch tv sitting directly in front of it.\nbought at 28k during bbd sale.",

SD SET TOP Box picture is below average which is usual. Don't do much experiment with picture settings , keep default settings out of the box. Viewing angles are good.\n\nSound quality: Excellent sound output from the two speakers. No need of additional spekar to connect. For Dolby Audio you must play supported content. Please choose Dynamic in the sound settings.\n\nConnectivity: I don't have any issues with chrome casting. USB port is version 2.O , so a bit slow for external hard disk. I don't have HDMI /SPDIF Devices, so no comments on that .Bluetooth TV Remote is quite compact, light weight & responsive but u need some days to get used to this.\n\nAndroid tv interface: On early usages it is a bit slow but after 6 hrs of usages it becomes more responsive.\n\nInstalation: I will recommend you to install in wall because TV is light & with stand a bit shaky. Keep atleast 6 ft. distance between you & TV for better viewing.\n\nI think for price to performance ratio this TV fits strongly as compared to its rivalries. I will post my full depth review after one month of usages.",
            "This is the best one can ask for the price you pay. Stunning display. Beautiful colors. 4k videos are treat to your eyes, color reproduction is amazing.

            "My First Review on Flipkart India.\nI have Completed 01 Year With Product\nPro.\n1) Easy to Handling\n2) You can Connect Hard Disc easy\n3) 4k videos play in USB mode smoothly.\n5) Cinerama options Good With 16:09 Frame.\n6) T-Cast Options is Very Well Work Now.\n7) you Can Run Any apps from Play Store Android.\n\nCons\n1) you Can use Voltage Stabilizer, I don't use before without Stabilizer my led is Totally Dead. But Services will resume after 1 months coz Covid19 I suggest you should use Stabilizer.\n2) 4k Vodeos Not Plying Properly on YouTube\n3) Led Open little bit slow.\n4) unable to seek File! Error while you Play a video via T-Cast i.e. 2gb Above files Means UHD Movies or HDR10 Forward or Backward just play.\n5) Sometimes led Automatically off/on but very very raley with my Product.\n\nSo, my Honest review share with us it is worthy .\nThnks to Flipkat, Or TCL iffalcon Technical Engineers.",
            "Very nice looking and awesome at this price range. Connectivity is somewhat not up to the mark. Overall it's nice and picture clarity is jaw dropping.",
            "Third class tv not durable also after sale service of Jeeves is not dependable they not give any resolution\nGive every time exuse only I baught this tv and also purchase comlete protection of Jeeves for three year\nMy tv is switch of befor two month and never start after this after two month I feel feasted no solution provide by Jeeves and flipkart ,\nAny body please suggest me what I am do agaist this situation..??",
            "Excellent Purchase in this Big Billion Day !\nReceived the TV in 15 hrs after Order and installation by the Jeeves team on the same day. Kudos to Flipkart for that.\nTV is exceptionally beautiful for it's price tag ,got 55\" for 24,100 after various discounts..\nDisplay is good though it isn't great as the big brand TVs , Dolby sound with my 4.1 speakers is amazing, connecting the TV with WiFi, app setup were all done with ease.\nHD & SD channel quality is satisfactory , it's advisable to sit from a distance for pleasant viewing.\nI don't know why this TV isn't getting desired attention that it deserves in the YouTube reviews. YouTubers are extremely biased for the new Motorola TV and VU premium Android.\nThis TV costs 8k lesser than VU premium Android TV. only Con is the 270 nits brightness as against 450 nits of VU. But in closer room that hardly matters. Also Dolby Vision in VU is a joke considering it's lack of minimum requirements for Dolby Vision.\nPros of Iffalcon over VU are latest Android, Connectivity easeness , fast boot up time, better sound. Note both the TVs have same resale value.\nNote : It's advisable to buy additional 2 yrs of full warranty protection with Jeeves ( Purchase with the Installation guy, he offers it for RS.1930) . anything related to TV malfunctioning will be taken care of for free of cost.",
            "Writing this review after using this TCL iffalcon tv for 7months. Build quality is optimal, picture Clarity and brightness are acceptable in this price range and I don't see any lag in playing 4K movies Either through external drive or online content. Sound is good with stereo speakers without bass. Super smooth performance and will last long if you can maintain with proper care. Bluetooth connectivity is good. Overall full paisa vasul. Don't go with brands as all brands are offering 1yr warranty and genuine spares are challenging if you go with bigger brands.",
            "when I purchased this tv I was little worried about the picture and sound quality but when I got this tv I am so happy . plus points are:- 1.picture quality is great 2.Sound quality is amazing (no need of external speakers) Dolby Atmos 3.wifi bluetooth is so quick . ...\nREAD MORE",

Light weight so it gets good fit on wall too with out any problem. Also I feel this TV is value for money. It comes with one tv smart remote with voice recognition and material required for wall hanging. I also bought 3 years warranty from flipkart as it was convenient and required too. Whoever planning to buy, should buy during deal , so you get some extra discount.\n\nApart from all of the above i like the service flipkart provided, starting from TV delivery to technician reaching home and fixing TV on wall. TV fixing was free for me including TV delivery. The day it got delivered , same day after noon it got fit on the wall. Best service I can say.",
            "Product is very good compare to other tv, sound clarity is also very good, picture clarity also very good, the final conclusion is this tv is value for money in this price...(29999)",

            "Pros: Great value for money, great features, latest Android Official TV OS, Ample connectivity options, official streaming Apps. Cons: viewing angles are not that great. colors and contrast appear washed out from about 130 degrees side viewing. Slow boot up. No full function remote provided, just one voice remote with minimal set of buttons. The 65\" TV from Iffalcon (2018) is my other TV where the above listed Cons are not applicable. that TV is a great product overall compared to this 55\". if you can afford that and have a larger room for 64\" TV then go for that instead. after sales support, I installation everything just fine. no issues.",
            "I think this tv is the best under 25k. sharp picture quality, smooth Android experience.\n\nIt sometimes feels laggy i.e after quite long usage (I don't turn off for usually 4-5 days and keep a lot of apps open). However, it gets back to normal after a restart.",
            "I couldn't be happier I returned Kotak's so called 4k ( not 4K ) tv for this Stunner. I absolutely have nothing to complain about Picture quality : Crystal Clear , Sound : Dolby Atmos, perfect . Android : Latest and super smooth . I had doubts about Brightness but it didn't disappoint at all, It's Sufficient enough. Bought this for 23250 Rupees and it's worth every penny. Don't hesitate, go for it. You won't regret it\n\nUpdate ! Prime Video works on this device now !",
            "After using it for more than a month (8 to 12 hrs per day)\n* Picture quality is excellent at this price. I encountered no restart issues till date as it was mentioned in various review which made me had second thoughts for going for this product. I faced no such issues.\n* Sound quality is awesome it really rocked my room with crystal clear audio.\n* Connectivity with WiFi and hotspots very fast and smooth with no hastle whatsoever. Initially I was worried that at such price tag will I get good software and hardware combo. But again I was surprised in this department also.\n* In built app like Netflix and other work like charm and give theatre like feeling in my bedroom. very satisfied\n* Casting is very easy with apps like hotstar, voot, MX player, zee5, YouTube and so on. But you have to give up on clarity wich I personally belived was not fault of TV, but fault off app as well as internet speed. I must mention hear that I am strictly using my mobile data to watch all the content.\nI can only imagine what the picture quality will be when used with broadband.\n* Remote is ergonomically well designed, with OK button slightly mounted high gives idea of relative other buttons\n* Overall great experience till date. Every feature mentioned for the product works well. I have give one star less for picture quality, but guys let's face this, one cannot compare this product with likes of Sony, LG and Samsung. At this price point it is definitely a buy and worth every Paisa.",
            "I bought this for 26.5k on sale.I think this is value for money for 55 inch android TV.\nWriting this review after couple of months of usage.\nThis is a VA panel with 270 nits brightness.\n270 nits brightness is in the lower side.\nBecause VA panel it will not give colors accuracy like IPS panel.But it is DLED compared to edge led which most of the IPS panel TVs are so that is a plus.\nPicture is OK. When using YouTube or vod apps like hotstar,sonyliv and others I get good picture quality.\nBut when I play my own downloaded 4k HDR files I don't get\nsatisfactory results. Not bad but not perfect.\nIt does support both HDR and HDR10 but does not support Dolby Vision.\n\nSound is again hit n miss. In some scenario it is OK but on some contents it is not. You have adjust based on the content you are watching.\n\nFor the price it is still a good buy.",
            "For the price you pay, its max one can ask for. Not sure of durability as it's just been 2 weeks since I started using this. Overall picture & sound quality are nice. Initial boot up takes bit longer but that's only when you start the TV. Smart remote helps you in google voice search, which is way better then typing.Giving 5 start considering the price of this TV.",

            "Product is litrally awesome and working fine. its a 50 Inch LED 4K AI Android TV.\nIt has been really a good experience with flipkart and TCL since placement of orders till today when i am using this product. I got product in just one day after its order and on same day the product got installed. The delivery/installation channel partner were very polite and good.\nAs far as the quality of TV is concerned, it is being sold under TCL Flagship and quality of product is awesome. The product has very good picture quality (True 4K and HDR ) and decent sound output. I am using my BOSE system with this, so i am not bothering for its actual sound output. It has features of auto volume leveling and auto dimming facility (screen light adjustment as per the your room light).\nThe user interface is pretty good and easy to understand. RC is handy but small. This should have been little big. You may feel difficulties with RC while operating in a dark room. The remote has TCL and Netflix dedicated keys for the ease of its operation. Android operating system is good with connectivity of AI. The AI takes your instructions. In overall this give an amazing experience. You can sync & Mirror easily with your smartphone.\nAt last not the least, It come with 1+ 3 years of insurance which ads on to its value.\nI had 5 star experience and I must recommend to all the viewers to buy this product if you are not a big brand conscious. I am sure, you literally wont get these features at this price bracket.\nAll the best.",

            "great TV with all modern features a high end TV should have at a economical price bracket. Only downside is it's not supporting the in-built cast app of phones to connect to the TV. To cast we have to compulsorily use the tcast app.",

            "VFM device no complaints. When i purchased this in october, 2019 i was worried about prime video update as it was not there out of the box and sideloaded app was not working fully. Thanks they kept the promise and gave update in December end instead of October and i must say they are better than xiaomi as they gave what they promised. I never expected that they will fulfill promise within time. Everything else is good be it picture, sound, connectivity and sound is the best I am loving it. I don't think one needs a sound bar if you are using it in your bedroom or any small room. Brightness is more than enough I even lowered it as 100 percent brightness put strains on eyes in a room of 10*12 inches.\n\nHaven't used MI TV but it feels to me that they are cashing their mobile brand image in TV business. This one is better than MI i believe as i have seen quality issues with MI TVs recently.\n\nFlipkart delivery and installation was on time, the person installed TV at around 08:00 p.m. which I never expected. I hope that they integrate prime soon as promised though you can watch many things on prime app downloaded from playstore.",

Some 4 k videos are playing in black nd white. And youtube also is loading in bw. I don't know whether I have messed up with some settings. I have mailed the. regarding this issue.

No connectivity issue.\n3. Sound will take you by surprise. It's incredibly loud and clear.\n4. I use it to play games on XBox. So far, I didn't face any issues related to connectivity with controller. Only that if you want to enjoy games in 4K, you need to plug HDMI cable in Hdmi 1 port and not Hdmi 2.\n5. TV is big enough to play games or watch Netflix or whatever.\n\nCons:\n1. I have seen a horizontal line at the top of the screen 2-3 times. Although it went away on restarting the TV.\n2. TV display settings simply do not work. I can't adjust the brightness properly. Although for games, I can adjust the view using XBox display settings.",

            "as per the cost this tv is really good. it's really a budget friendly tv with good quality and sound but don't expect a picture quality alike Samsung and Sony. although it's a UHD 4k tv it has some cons like blacks are not too dark, ofcourse you can be satisfied with it's micro dimming feature. over all it's a budget tv with good picture quality.",
            "oh man! i love the picture clarity, easy handling and usage and overall everything, rather than the sound quality, as it isn't adequate all the times, i found an alternative external sound bar to be the right one. apart from that, the disadvantage i could day you means, nothing, just you will be take your own time to get learn with the usage, and response isn't as using a computer, it responds like an old windows xp computer.",
            "For weeks n months I had been researching for a new TV. I always research in details about specs n features of a product. So when I finalized this, I was actually thrilled I did not choose the second option that I had. The picture quality is superb and the sound is close to perfection. So I doubled the sound with my home theatre and voila, I got myself my own bid screen cinema. Go for it, it's the best value for money!!!!!",
            "If u are looking for a budget TV with all the features go for this. it's worth the price. But one thing to keep in mind is before u purchase make sure you have the service centre or support center in your area. Because this I bought in Bangalore and am aware that there are service centers so any after purchase problem can be rectified soon but if it's in a different state or place then probably the shipping of the product the repair time and everything would take a minimum time of one month for u to get it completely rectified.\npros-\nConnectivity to blue tooth screen mirror all work seamlessly well.\nSound is clear and loud without any Bluetooth or additional speakers\nAll the latest features like voice control (Google assistant) work fine if you pronounce words properly \ud83d\ude04\nCons-\nLittle bit of blue tint appears on black (hair) Making it look artificial when playing hd. but that only appears when I use the cable or dish channels. may be a fault with the hd set top box or the broadcaster. doesn't happen on hd movies with Netflix or you tube, very clear picture quality in hd.\nautomatic adjust to Bright and dark screen is annoying sometimes. and not able to turn off this feature also.\nonly one remote makes it difficult to type when it comes to searching or entering data.\n\nOverall review the TV is awesome.. just what I expected. Speaking about the installation and delivery was also very very good installation was done at 9 in the night and because I wasn't at home when he called in the evening at 6 he still made it a point to come and finish it for me by the end of the day based on my request. he was very polite had very good knowledge of the product and demo was good. all that was needed to be known was shown by the installation personnel. overall good experience on the purchase.",

Pictures are sharp. No aliasing after 1.5ft away from the TV. (5/5)\n2. Audio is good. Not too high bass and treble but equalised. (4/5)\n3. Not just for this TV but most of the Android TVs, it feels like the UI is not optimized for best UX. There is a bug where I'm not able to navigate to my apps in PlayStore. However, you rarely come to this point.(3.75/5)\n4. Tried screen casting with native app as well as other screen casting apps available on PlayStore but it didn't connect at all. But media on phone can be casted easily. (2.5/5)\n5. Screen casting with laptop (tested with Ubuntu) is very fast. It feels little slow when you are casting 4k videos but otherwise flawless. (4/5)\n6. Wifi connectivity and Bluettoth connectivity are super fast. (5/5)\n7. You can view good quality picture through 170\u00b0.\n8. I bought this on Republic day, delivered the next day and installed the subsequent day.\n9. Overall rating - 4.25/5\n\nAfter 3 months of extreme usage:\n\n1. I still feel the same picture quality. That is very good.\n2. I personally felt that and external audio source is required for a bteer or home theater experience.\n3. Got used to the not-so-optimized Android TV UI. So it's not a much of problem. Controls for seeking the movie especially with Amazon Prime sucks.\n4. I still couldn't find an app better that Google Chromecast for screen casting. However, the casting is very slow.\n5. Screen casting with laptop still holds the same impression.\n6. WiFi connectivity is the place where I've faced severe problem. During these 3 months I have to reset the TV to factory setting for 4 times for connecting to WiFi. It just shows unable to connect to WiFi. When you try to comnect it again by forget network, it's not going to work. All you have to do is resetting the TV. I missed my personalized apps and need to start as a brand new product. Signin after reset, cutomizing apps again and installing the apps is a hectic task. There should be some update to correct this. This is the place where you can make a choice before buying.\n7. Still impressed with the viewing angle.\n\nNew points of note:\n1. The remote is very powerful. I have used it for a rouge test and found it very much fine.\n2. If you have a home theater attached to the TV, you will really have a theater experience, preferably wireless.\n3. Really worth the price you put and assured uality in your experience when compared to that of othe TVs in the same budget range.\n4. Booting takes time around 52 seconds!",

            "This is the best smart tv with stock android available in this price segment. You can download apps as well as side load apps on this tv. Sound quality is excellent, contrast ratio is excellent, picture quality is superb. You will need a HD set top box and a high speed internet connection to view 4k content",
            "According to me it's the best value for money product. With very excellent picture and sound quality. Connectivity is impressive too. But it's both positive and negative quality is micro dimming as most of the time it work good but at times when there is to much lighting in the picture it increases the saturation very much and makes the picture quality detoriate, but only some times. Over all a very good product.",
            "You just can't ask for anything more at the price of 26K. Immersive Display.. Absolutely great colors when HDR is On. Sound is just Too Good and Loud.. You won't need a Home Theatre with this TV. Way better than MI. Great Installation Support by Jeeves. Technician Mr. Neeraj from Dhanraj Home Services very well behaved and knowledgeable. Great Service and Product Experience...",
            "Happy with product but not happy with delivery people and installation guy.. Installation came as per his convenience and didn't explain completely about product. Iffalcon should stop asking for feed back on installation Guy's phone, please take feedback after the person leaves",

Thank you IFFALCON for giving a budget tv which can compare the top models. (review after 8 days) And service is also nice.. EXTRA 5 stars for display its super awesome guys....",
            "This 4K TV exceeds the expectations for a budget TV with pure android experience, really nice picture quality and OK sound. With micro dimming ability, the blacks are really nice with the maximum brightness kind of OK. The top brightness of this TV is nothing mind blowing on paper. At 280 nits, its a shame when compared with big brand TVs and OLEDs. However, the brightness is quite adequate and I have to set it at 80% for normal viewing. Yes, due to this limitation, contract ratio is quite low which you may notice in scenes with intense darkness as well as bright spots. However, what more can you expect from a budget TV.\n\nPrime video, Hotstar, Sony Liv, Jio Cinema, ZEE5 can be downloaded from the playstore.",

It has inbuilt chrome cast support so, you can enjoy chromecast service... Overall very nice product...",
            "The side vision makes the quality of the picture quickly dimmer even if you just step aside from front of the device.. Other than that it is just superb in this pocket friendly cost.

But on receipt of the item, i realized that the TV is just awesome.\n\nPicture Quality is Ok when you watch the SD Videos/Channel (Its not a fault of the TV). But when you play the HV & 4K videos.. Woow.. its amazing. I will give 4 out of 5 Starts since the SD video is not much satisfactory.\n\nSound Quality is superb with Dolby. There is a headphone jack port, Digital port and Bluetooth connectivity also. Using a home theater is advised for a better experience. I will give 5 out of 5 Stars.\n\nThere is no words to tell about the remote controller and inbuilt google assistant. Remote is paired through Bluetooth and gives a hassle free operation. Google assistant makes the interaction more easier. For the connectivity and other features, I would like to give 5 out of 5 stars.\n\n2GB RAM and 16 GB memory gives a lag-less operation of the TV. But we need to see the performance in the long run. I will give 4.5 starts out of 5 Stars.",

            "Awesome tv for budget.. nice clarity and sound picture quality is so good everyone must buy it",
            "I have been using this TV for more than 8 months now. Works perfectly, picture and sound quality are amazing. Absolutely no issues. Supports all common OTT apps like Netflix, Prime Video, Hotstar, Sony Liv, Zee 5, Voot, etc. Very good wifi connectivity. Proper android TV, very happy that I bought it.",
            "The picture quality of this TV is Nice and the Sound Quality is also very Good.Usb & Hdmi Ports are far behind that is not easy approachable.Google voice command is working Perfectly.\nOverall in this Price segment it's a very Good Deal",
            "screen mirror is not working properly, picture quality is average because its not good while producing black colour 720p video are blurry even if the best one, its a android tv but missing lots of android basic features, i think its not a direct LED Because the light is coming from edges not from the back of its panel, we can clearly see when screen goes black the edges are lighten bright as compare to the middle of the whole screen over all its a average performance, not very satisfactory ,",
            "Yeah... Super TV at very friendly price.\nI ran out some 4k sample through VLC MEDIA PLAYER installed in tv....Boom!! It ran like awesome. All colors and smoothness are looking very real.\nNormal SD channels are also working very fine as compare to our previous 43 inch tv Panasonic.\n\nSound is very nice\nAs in our bedroom it works like beast sound.\n\nTv remote is best... Best thing is it bluetooth remote which is quite good.\n\nYouTube playback also very good.\nYou can run YouTube from mbl also by using WATCH ON TV on YouTube mobile app.\n\nSuggestion: Try to buy 4k Tv if you are buying more than 40 inch tv because of pixel size... Upscalling of 4K tv is very good compare to full HD TV's.\n\nSome of the settings you have to fix for the richer experience for example Sound as Dynamic and brightness from eco to brightness+. Just fix some of these settings you good to go\n\nCon: SideAngle washed little bit because of VA PANEL\nBut you black is very good bcs of this panel only.\n\nOverall best tv... Now lets hope it will run longer \ud83d\udc4c",
            "Excellent performance and this budget.\n\n1. Glazing picture quality, run 4K videos to check the actual tv picture quality. Dont judge by running SD channels.\n\n2.

            "The TV is actually good.. The pricing is perfect and does offer all the features one need in a Smart TV. This is an Android TV hence connectivity is not a problem unlike normal Smart TVs. Picture quality is amazing and netflix can be streamed in HDR10. FYI - There's only one remote available with this TV unlike other brands.",
            "Pros : 1 very good picture quality with any input above 720 p 2. Connectivity options are very good and work perfectly. 3. Sound is very good. 4. App availability is also very good. Prime video will get added. 5. Advanced picture and sound settings can be configured for each input type separately. Cons :1 viewing angle could have been better.(it's a VA panel not ips I think) 2. Granular controls on backlight not available. It's all dynamic. 3. Sound graphic equaliser not available. 4. Default picture setting required lot of caliberation to suit our liking (thankfully advanced setting option is available with standard mode) 5. SD content is just OK. You can watch but can't enjoy it. Half screen issue can be resolved by turning of auto screen adjustment in settings-picture-advanced picture settings-screen adjustments- turn off the top most option",

            "I find this tv to be extra ordinary! ordered it on 20th aug and the tv delivered and installed next day. No worry about the service quality and reach in my city(patna) as flipkart\u2019s own service partner jeeves will look after all the warranty requirements. I also bought 2 year additional jeeves extended warranty as the brand is not popular and i am not sure about the durability although based on past experiences if all goes well till 3 years i would say nothing will happen in next 4-5 years as i am still using 2011 built micromax tv with huge bazels without any issue and its been 8 years. Now coming to the iffalcon 55\u201d4KUHD . I am using this tv mainly netflix just from the installation and watched all episode of sacred games in 4K. So far everything is OK picture quality in 4K is good inbuilt sound is good but i connected my 5.1 system with this, brightness is satisfactory i cant say i found any scene in those 8 episode where i feel lack of light in the tv. I have set my picture to smart HDR mode but One thing i do not like is the auto dimming or adaptive brightness as in some scene the brightness was auto adjusting. I am looking for some settings to turn it off as I am not well used to this adaptive brightness thing hope i can find the right settings for this.In the end of all I hv got what i needed in 36K. Waiting for the prime video update without this app there is something missing I tried installing it through sideload method but that app was not doing so well with the tv so uninstalled it and waiting for official release",

Connectivity to WiFi network, Bluetooth keyboard and home theatre are very good. so far have not faced any issue. In built Netflix, and prime video are extra advantage.

There are apps available which provides live streaming of Indian and international channels. I have been using this TV since 10 days and the experience is up to the mark. Picture quality is awesome with more than the required brightness. Sound quality is too good that you don't need additional speakers. You can install any app just like an android device (need to install via apk files instead of Google Play Store ;). The only cons which I have felt are the Bluetooth connectivity with your Phone and mobile device's hard drive access into TV using data cable. These are not possible",

So, don't go for the negative reviews because they say because they have a poor network connection\nKeep in mind, that the points which I am going to tell are based on good network.If you have good network connection then all the features will work very good.

If you have good network then don't listen to the negative reviews and go for it.\n\nPicture: Picture is extremely good as the branded android tv in such a less price.\n\nConnectivity: It is also very good compared to the branded android tv. If you check the reviews of sony, mi, lg as well as samsung then you would see that the pictures are good but the connectivity is not good.\n\nChromecast: It is also extremely good. In this case also you will see that the branded android tv doesn't work good on chromecast also.\n\nSound quality: It is also very much good.\n\nInstallation: My tv was installed the day after I got the TV.\n\nSo go for it at such a less price and enjoy !",

My TV doesn't have any browser installed, Google play for TV hasn't got all those apps which google play for mobile has. This is to prohibit unauthorised use of apps not meant for TV.\nWork around like side loading app is not always successful as in the end the mode would be portrayed not landscape.

I trusted the brand of Google and Flipkart both, feel cheated by both of them. if there was zero rating possible, I would give it that. uninstalling Flipkart too. but I hate IFFALCON and Flipkart so much after this cheating, I'll come to respond to any queries. it's box looks better than the TV inside. hate this. and the brand is not even admitting their fault regarding contrast and brightness.\n\n1. screen quality 0.5 out of 5.\n2. value for money, 0.8 out of 5.",

So, the engineer rejected my replacement request.\n\nFLIPKART and JEEVES people are basically telling me to live with and use the defective product. They should have mentioned the issue in product specification page itself.\nMy MONEY IS WASTED AS THESE FLIPKART AND JEEVES PEOPLE are not taking back the defective TV product and refunding my money.\n\n... Don't go for this TV even if this TV is cheap compared to others, cause this tv is not at all worth the price.

Move to anywhere other than sitting straight in front of the screen and the colors will change to highly inaccurate level and you'll lose all the details.\n3) Connectivity issues marring YouTube app that every other the app tells me to sign in which can only be resolved after a reboot.\n4) Speakers are Top-notch and very loud. Lovely experience even at low volume levels, Bass is pretty good. Dialogue can be heard crisp and clear. very satisfied with audio output.\n5) Build quality is fantastic and the TV set is quite light.",

The TVs display stopped working within 2 months and this unfortunately fell amidst the corona crisis,I was very patient with the customer care given the situation but the worst thing is that the request was being cancelled multiple times with weird reasons when the real problems were the lockdown. Even after the lockdown was lifted their service engineer visited 2 weeks after the lockdown was lifted and said there is a spare part replacement needed and this is the worst part , looks like the spare part is supposed to be shipped from Mumbai and it would take more than a month. Its been almost 3 months now and I am stuck with a TV that doesn't work.\n\nSecondly, the Flipkart complete protection that I purchased by paying an additional cost that pretty much is a scam from my opinion. The TCL customer care atleast had an engineer visit me. The Flipkart complete protection keeps saying some non sense whenever I call but they haven't even sent an engineer to examine the issue yet.\n\nOverall:\nProduct - nil quality check\nService - Kinda made me figure out why these TVs are cheap.\nFlipkart complete protection - pretty much bogus and waste of money",

I didn't find any problem with brightness too.\nOverall the features are excellent. ALL entertainment apps are supported in this TV, so this is also a positive. Only major con and biggest disappointment according to me is the slow bootup (around 30-40 seconds) and the general lag in television. With almost all major apps installed in my TV - Netflix, Hotstar, Prime, YouTube, SonyLiv, Voot etc, the TV lags quite frequently while changing between apps. The slow processing is quite irritating, and this is the ONLY compromise that one will have to make while buying this awesome TV at such cheap price.",

Love auto brightness feature. I issue i found is battery drains in remote a lot since 7 month i replaced them three times.

            "Received the tv yesterday. Brought the 43inch model for 19999, exchanged my old crt tv and got 2400 for it!! Installation was done today nd 1 thing to clarify here is, yes the light bleeding issue is real and you cannot avoid it with this TV. But imo it isn't a issue cause that's how dleds behave and you are getting best picture when you need it anyways. But you won't notice it while watching movies etc. You will get all the colors you want. Just some places like YouTube loading screen etc. Where grey screen is displayed, you'll notice it. But for me Personally, this isn't an issue at all. The tv isn't fastest, but also not on the annoying side when it comes to performance. This tv is actually the best option better than mi and flipkart's offering. If you're afraid of light bleeding then go for marq, but I'd suggest you to stay away form mi tv due to their pathetic after sales service. What I'd suggest is to get the extended warranty by flipkart. If you were unable to avail it, get it from jeeves by paying 1500 for for 2 years cover. If you found the info helpful vote up so other people can see this review and get their doubts clarified. Have a good day.",

            "The TV is Amazing in this Price!\nPros and Cons are here after 1month of usage!\n\nPros --\n1. Picture quality is great! I played Netflix 4K videos and works like charm! One thing, keep the TV display settings to Smart HDR and you are good!\n2. Being a 20W speaker, sound is much of a theatre like experience! It supports Dolby Atmos! I never went above 40 coz I never needed to! Played some songs in 100 for just testing and sound is crisp and very loud! No distortion nothing! Just clear sound!\n3. Played 4K videos downloaded them! I just played an 80gb movie via my HDD directly and VLC lagged a bit! But TV's Default player played it like a breeze! No struggle and picture quality is very good and crisp clear!\n4. It's also got micro dimming! In darker scenes the brightness of picture gets lower and content clearity increases!\n5. Power input is very less! 25W-30W per hour!\n6. Remote is very sensitive! The batteries are provided inside the box! TCL original batteries! Its working really well! No china 3rd class rubbish products overall! Just original and decent! Even the batteries! Great work their!\n7. Pen drives, HDD, Mouse, Keyboard, everything works like a Breeze!\n8. Ram is 2GB! Played asphalt 8 works really good! U have to use a gamepad! For some reason a wired gamepad doesn't work that good but atleast it works! Out of 16gb 11gb is available for use!\n9. Played via PS4 pro on it! Setting have to kept in Dynamic because the brightness gets reduced every now and then in Smart HDR! Switching tv to dynamic switches of Micro dimming! Also it has LED motion control which shows speedy objects very clear! Supports 4K gaming also!\n10. It has HDMI Arc! And I connected it to my laptop and it supports 4K gaming via laptop too! Max Refresh rate is 60hz!\n11. Its an Indian product! So wall mount is their in the box! It's not Mi or OnePlus!\n12. No backlight bleeding!\n13. Wifi speed and connectivity is good! Considering it only has single wifi band 2.4ghz, it's very good in connectivity! Connects very fast! And speed is also good!\n14. Packaging is good!\n15. Get a mouse(wireless would be best) and install Jio TV apk direct from any site! It's widely available! And no need for set top box! I use it via Jio TV only! Works great!\n\nCons --\n1. Plastic all over! It's very light and shaky! Stands are also made of plastic atleast they should have atleast provided a metal stand! Plastic built is acceptable in this price but metal stands could have been provided!\n2. Doesn't supports Dolby Vision! No Wide color gamut! But acceptable as its price is much lower!\n3. Chromecast is a little laggy! 0.7s lag! Both via laptop and phone!\n4. USB 2.0 ports! No 3.0! Feels a bit slow! Only 2 ports!\n5. Touching the screen creates distortion in the picture! This shows build quality is not that great! I have a Bravia 43inch and it has alot better quality! But I've seen motorolla and mi TV's! They are costlier than this TV but still equivalent in terms of built quality!\n\n\nVerdict is that this TV is the best at this price! Even better than motorolla TVs and mi! As they have screen bleeding issues but this one hasn't! I bought it for personal use as I have 2 TVs already! Bravia and LG! But this one is best value for money!",

Its been 4 months now am using it, no such lag ever encountered. And I have over 25 apps installed in it to give idea.\n- Clean UI, as it uses stock android. There is also another option to use TCLs own UI, but I prefer Android over that\n- Good upscaling. Sd channels are upscale by a good range\n\nNot so good things:\n- Mediocre sound reproduction. To be honest it is not that bad, but lows are not clear with whatever sound settings I try. Voice Clarity is good if isolated from music\n- Weak signal reception from remote. It may be one of cases but yes I am facing this.\n- Few connectivity ports. The TV has only 2 HDMI ports and 1 USB port. So if you are looking for more connectivity options then this may not be right choice.\n\nNot checked things\n- Of course the Post sales service as I have not faced any problem yet. But I will recommend to go with extended warranty which has a added benefit of return value.\n- Sound output via Peripherals. Have tried with Bluetooth devices and it was smooth. But still need to check with wired outputs like optical or Aux cable. Will update it soon.\n\nHope this helps.",

The range of viewing angles is up to the mark. The AI enabled display feature is a cool thing to have, especially when you watch a huge variety of content. The picture quality being offered in this price range is impeccable.\nSound: The sound output is optimum, however the clarity is one thing I'm a little unsatisfied with. Also, the speaker placement and their throw direction is a little awkward. My TV is wall mounted. The other side of the wall receives better sound output than the TV's front.\nConnectivity: There are certain connectivity issues I have faced since I bought the TV almost a year ago. If you set the 'Date and Time' to 'Manual' instead of 'Automatic', the Wi-Fi connection throws the 'no internet' and error. Trust me, I learnt this the hard way. Also, about 50% of the time, I don't see my TV's name when trying to cast my phone.\nOverall: The iFFALCON offers amazing viewing experience with a few technical issues.

The only con is the audio. It's good for music listener. But normal dialouges and low tones are not good, there is not enough bass in speakers. Thought they have bass enhancer, high definition mode in setting, but I don't find it very useful. In a movie if you're playing it in high volume for normal dialouges, it's become irritating when any music comes. The volume goes so high suddenly, and believe me it's frustrating to high and low the volume from remote again again.\nThere is nothing to complain about the 4k video panel. It's bright and colourful, the contrast is good. Although colours are over saturated, but I like it personally. Youtube, netflix, prime video all runs smoothly.",

You can hear music absolutely fine but you cannot hear the dialogues. So I always watch with bt headphones.\nOtherwise it is a decently priced 55 inches tv.",

            "One of the worst purchase of my life. TV is made with worst materials i feel. Purchased this tv back in august 2019. Initially everything was good. This year onwards tv started giving problem. Whenever there is any dark scenes tv was unable to lit up completely. Instead go dim and never come back to normal brighness just audio will be playing. Tv screen will be full black but if you dark your room you will be able to see that actually video is playing with brighness is not even visible for normal eyesight. This happened twice before it completely switched off one day. As it was on warranty Tcl service centre guy came and changed power circuit. After changing power circuit still had problem of tv going to dim when its gone to dark scenes. So again i complained to tcl service and again technician came and changed mother board. Still the issue has not resolved and technician now claiming its the issue with LED panel. I am actually regreting for buying this product as tcl has very bad service even i am from prime location still the tv repair is going on since may 4th and still not resolved. Please guys if you have 20k also never ever buy this product. This is definately made with cheap power circuit and led panel. Your product might even go bad within 2 years. I used VU tv for last 4 years and purchasing this was nightmare and tcl customer service not agreeing for replacement as well. PLEASE DONT DONT EVER BUY THIS PRODUCT. ITS CHEAP IN PRICE FOR A 4k TV BUT ITS MADE WITH CHEAP MATERIAL AS WELL. Wont long last.",
