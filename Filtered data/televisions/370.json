The Bluetooth connectivity is also good.",
            "Writing this review after using the TV for a week! The iFFALCON 50inch UHD 4K Smart TV 50K61 is an absolute winner. For the price, this is by far one of the best televisions you could buy especially if you are someone who loves good displays. Let me break this down:\n\nDisplay: 4K with scale up and dynamic dimming and HDR10 support. Now I was not sure how this was going to work, but once I switched it on and plugged in my PS4 into the ARC HDMI port, I was treated to an experience that I did not get from my previous 4K tv. HDR10 is truly something that you\u2019ll have to see to believe. And this display does not disappoint. Yes the brightness could have been a little bit more in terms of total NITS, but for a bedroom setup that\u2019s dark and cosy, this screen is absolutely brilliant!\n\nBuilt in Apps: Again, with Android pie out of the box the app support is excellent! And the best part- you get to watch HDR10 content right off the bat with Netflix and other supporting OTT services. The connections are seamless and the WiFi links are solid. I\u2019ve not had an issue with buffering at all over this past week of watching this TV.\n\nSound: The down firing speakers are good! Maybe not super brilliant or something but they sound really good. However, I use a 5.1 surround system in the room and the sounds are amazing from this TV. The internal processing for audio is excellent.\n\nDelivery and Installation: Now this is where I\u2019ll give full marks! The TV was delivered the next day of ordering and installation happened the same day as delivery! Rithik, the service engineer was very nice! Very polite, very handy with the whole process of installation and demo. It barely took him 20 mins to finish the job and I got my TV wall mounted! So exceptional service by the installation and delivery teams. Thank you Flipkart and TCL for this!\n\nOverall: From a budget perspective, this is by far the best 4K smart tv you could get your hands on. The remote which connects by Bluetooth is seamless and does not loose its connection. The tv processor is quick with sufficient RAM to carry out the actions you request. And the overall viewing experience is fantastic!\n\nI recommend this TV for anyone looking to upgrade to a large screen size without feeling the dent on their wallet! Go for iFFALCON 50K61!",
