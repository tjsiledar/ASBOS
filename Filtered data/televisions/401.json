            "TV is awesome and desire for a needful customer which demand in TV\nand I am happy to see audio jack its amazing to connect home Theatre enjoy movies and vedio songs",
            "Bought this LG 43 inch LET TV for my home. Without waiting for installation I opened the pack and completed the installation myself. I have connected my Dish TV set top box through HDMI. I was also able to set up my Prime TV account and watched a prime video. My initial opinion about the TV is that it is excellent. My top priority was picture quality. I am fully satisfied by the TVs picture quality, particularly the Animal planet HD channel. Even the SD channels are not bad. Regarding sound quality, I actually had no interest in knowing the TVs sound quality since I decided to connect my sound system with it. But the sound quality of the TV is not bad. It is not very effective but enough for normal watching. I am also happy that I have received a fresh product manufactured recently. The delivery was prompt. I am glad that after all the research and analysis I have bought a reputed brand TV at a nominal price with no cost EMI. It is impossible to buy a LG or Samsung TV at this price at the local market.",
            "Display quality is best and sound is best , connectivity is also best awesome tv at this price\ud83d\ude0a",
            "Received this TV with one day of placing order kudos to Flipkart for keeping their comment always. Moreover, Installation done on same day. LG Installation guy was superb he did wall mounted while my mother/father in law had no idea how TV will fit in that particular position. Thanks to LG representative Sh. Ranjan for his great support. Normally I am not prefer UHD and 4K combination to buy as both the option are futuristic, has no value as of now. Full HD with smart/android option is more than sufficient to cater all our regular requirements. I gone through several low budget option TV since last 3 months to choose from, finally convinced that either that does not have major streaming option i.e. NETFLIX and PRIME or Picture quality not delivered what they are committing. Moreover, Picture quality is not at per in comparison with Majore 3 brands i.e. Sony, Samsung and LG. Out of which I choose LG as this is more cost effective. However, LG's new vervision i.e. AI TV has 1 significant change i.e. voice control. For that, paying high price is unjustified according to me. I gone through almost entire review posted in Flipkart. I surprised to see that connectivity has very low rating, believe me I found the same as flawless. For new buyers understanding I want to mention that I do have SONY 55inch 3D Android TV, Samsung 55inch Smart TV, LG 43inch FHD 3D TV. In comparison to these TV's I found this is ready good TV at budget price. Picture quality is stunning, Voice is sufficient as it support DTS, attachment of home theater would be awesome. Hence, I highly recommending to buy this TV.",
            "BEST IN BUDGET\n\nIn this price this is best deal, color look different than va panel but its ok..no branded manufacturers giving 43 inch tv in this Price , Upscalinng of sd channel is better than vu, mi tv. Sound is good . Hdr mode is terrific..full hd videos are awesome deep colors, less contrast than samsung tv but this is ok. Highly recommend for big tv lovers.",
            "Best IPS LED Display with FHD Resolution.\nSound output is too good.\n1) The general settings is popup bit slower after updating my WebOs to 4.7\n2) In description 2 unit remote is mentioned but magic remote is not there . Major disappointment.\n3) lg tv plus app is also not easy to connect. Which can be used like magic remote.\nSo these 3 things are big disappointing, so i have given 4 star for the product.",
            "I am writing this review after using for 7 days. Best LED TV with IPS Panel in this range. Colours are really good ad sound is also sufficient for a medium size room. Smart features including all the apps like Prime, Netflix, hotstar and Zee5 works like a charm. I would recommend to go for this TV without second thought. LG brand is always trustworthy since I had my first CRT TV of LG brand. You might feel hesitate to spend few extra thousands when compare to chinese companies like Realme, MI etc but there is no comparison of Lg with these chinese brands. Customer support and installation was smooth including Wall mount( free of cost). I am very happy with my decision.",
            "Pros :\n1. Good picture quality even with SD set top box\n2. Good sound clarity\n3. Connectivity is good\n\nCons :\n1.

LG technicians don't know about the product, we need to learn to use it of our own\n4. If this tv is used with sundirect dth, if you increase/ decrease tv volume, dth channel will Change. LG technician says it a known issue\n\nOverall, good product at this price range from one of the leading manufacturer.\n\nIn my view, visited retail shops and reviewed MI, panasonic, Sony tvs and LG wins the race with cost and picture/sound quality overall",

            "I bought the 43in TV and it's awesome. The panel is amazing and they are giving 2 years warranty for it. Sound is good but not great. For the price it's the best you can buy. The UI is not very smooth but it's not that bothering since it's a tv and not a smart phone. The remote is very plasticy and looks cheap.. even my 8 year old 26in LG led TV has a better remote. But again for the price i can't ask more. Thanks LG",

            "The product is good. But when we speak in terms of picture quality and sound, connectivity is average. Delivery by Flipkart was on time. but the person who came for installation was not that experienced to guide how to connect tv with set top box.. instead he told us to read the manual to connect..it looked like he was in hurry and not willing to help.",

            "First of all...Service from FK was top notch as usual. Initially, Installation was bumpy but LG CC was helpful.\nConsidering the price, Picture quality is Average with STB, but Good with online streaming like Youtube, Prime etc. Viewing Angle is not impressive, Contrast and Color distortion observed from different viewing angles.\nSound is above average, loud enough.\nDrawback is the Connectivity. Bluetooth not found. Typing with remote is a cumbersome job. Connecting with Mobile Phones are a hassle, hit or miss type. Somewhat consistent while connecting with Laptop.\nOverall satisfied. Still evaluating. Let's see, how long it runs.",

            "This tv is completely worth the price and can't think of any of the flaws in the set though this is just third day of use, will update if something comes out till then it's the best in 39-43 inch segment, some issues about magic remote as some of the reviewers mentioned believe me it won't be an issue. If you guys looking for purchase in this range, go.for.it and you will never be disappointed.",

            "Very bad. Installation date was given as 14th october and nw its 17th october. Still no confirmation on when the executive will arrive. How will we know if this is a genuine product if u cannot send the executive before return period? Customer care also does not have the right answers. Didnt expect this from flipkart",

Only 2 HDMI and no vga port. 3.5mm whole is in an awkward position should keep it at the side.\nLG service and quality is good as always. My TV got installed on the very next day. Flipkart delivery was on time.\nPrice got lowered by 1k now so its definitely a good buy. If you need a branded trustworthy tv.
