            "Satisfied!!!\n\nSometimes you take your decisions on your instincts rather than advices and you hit bang on. Buying Marq has been a similar experience,there were no reviews on this particular model as it was launched during the sale day but at 36k(includes additional warranty)it was too lucrative to be missed. Here\u2019s my experience after 10 days of observation-\n\nDelivery-\nFaster than expected. The delivery period was 14 days , I got it on the 4th day.\n\nInstallation-\nThe Jeeves technician was really helpful as installing the TV on WALL Mount at my home was little complicated but he did a real good job on it.\n\nService-\nAgain the same technician had visited when I had requested a service visit as I had some doubts about the picture quality and he helped with the settings which improved the picture quality much better.\n\nPicture quality -\nGood but could be better. One may not find the same effects as a Sony or Samsung or Lg but I would say Marq has done a pretty good job considering the price point and other factors.\n\nSound-\nTo the mark, in-fact better than I had expected. No need to have an additional sound bar.\n\nConnectivity-\nWas pretty smooth and had no issues at all.\n\nHD and 4K content-\nOn the set top box watching HD content is really good but SD is a disappointment. HD on internet with decent speeds is just fine. Regarding UHD4K, as far my knowledge goes our we still don\u2019t have much content on our set-top box and if you plan to watch it on internet one needs to have at-least 25 mbps speed to see the true effects. Even Netflix which has UHD content is unable to show until you have very high speed internet at home.Unfortunately I don\u2019t have it so I cannot comment on it yet.\n\nFinal verdict-\nIf you are a common layman like me who does not go into too much integrities of picture quality,sound and other features this is just the right product. Also note that at this price this is definitely a steal and it also helpful if you plan to change your TV faster to keep up with the new technologies in the market.",

            "I did a fair bit of research for almost a month in search of a new TV ever since my 8 year old 40\" Sony started showing issues. I knew sooner or later I have to buy a new TV. I did market research both online and in local shops before buying this one. Here are some of my conclusions.\n\n1. Well known brands such as Sony, Lg and Samsung cost almost double or even triple the price of budget TVs\n2. Even though they cost much more, none of them are offering warranty above 1 year , which in my opinion makes no sense.\n3. Sure, the branded TVs are brighter and vivid than budget TVs, but its negligible. You have keep it side by side to see the difference.\n4. Extended warranty purchase for branded TVs are very costly.\n\nThus I concluded budget TVs made perfect sense, but the issue was I cannot verify in person the real performance of these Tvs, Since they where online only products. I had to rely on online reviews and ratings to make my decision. After two weeks of usage I don't regret my purchase. Let me explain my point.\n\n1. This TV have enough brightness to view without glares in a well lit room. (Background light is set to 100% by default).\n2. Color reproduction is good and I had no issues viewing any type of videos.\n3. Android certified Smart TV, with voice assistant is a delight to use.\n4. 10 bit HDR (1.07 B Colors) is a feature many budget TVs miss.\n5. Good inbuilt speakers (Dolby Digital).\n6.

            "Love the 4K picture clarity. Best TV in this price range. Apps can be sideloaded easily via USB. (NETFLIX is not supported hence doesn't work. Same goes for Amazon Prime. I already have a Firestick so no problem at all.) Speakers on the TV are good enough but if you want good home theater experience, it's a good idea to invest in a Soundbar with good bass. The TV only has optical sound output option... So 3.5mm jack or Stereo Out or HDMI ARC is NOT available, ensure if you are buying Soundbar or 5.1 speaker system, it does have an optical input option. I've tried playing 4k 2160p HDR movies by connecting my Hard Disk and the native media player does a brilliant job at that. People complaining about blacks or Dark scenes performance on the panel are just too demanding...I find no issue here... Screen quality is actually more than you can ask for (specially in this killer budget) One more aspect this TV wins at is the official YouTube app... Playing UHD content on YouTube native app is really enjoyable and easy. (on my Amazon Firestick I was using an alternate app for YouTube and the experience was not that great.) The UI is also fast and the RAM management is adequate. TV starts faster than many similar range offerings in the segment... iFFalcon, Mi etc. About the extended warranty, you should definitely TAKE the 2 years extended warranty being offered by Jeeves as it gives you peace of mind for atleast 3 years, given that Marq is a fairly newer brand. The Smart remote which is Bluetooth enabled looks & feels quite premium and is so easy to use. Well, lastly, the 55inch panel looks quite overwhelming when watching any 4k content and is simply mind blowing.",
            "If I talk about this TV so I would like to discuss some pros and cons of it.\n\nPros:\n1. Dolby sound is better and give you a surround experience.\n2. Day light images really come alive and give a nice contrast and clarity.\n3. It comes with Media player which plays most of the audio and video formats.\n4. In built YouTube app allows you to play online video contents easily.\n\nCons:\n1. Screen has the white spots which doesn't seem pretty good when TV goes complete in black Transition.\n2. Night movie scene or darker images do not go pretty well that it should be.\n3. Inbuilt media player do not play DTS surround audio and MXlayer and VLC etc. not supportable and it is certified android but not all apps you can find on it. there is very few apps you can install and always apps go into the pending mode which is really irritating.\n\nVerdict:\n\nThis the best budget 4K TV in this range. you could go for it but if you have higher budget you can consider another one if your budget allows you.",

There is some distracting patches probably screen backlight bleeding on top of the screen left side mostly while the picture is black and so it is becoming difficult to enjoy the darker scenes at nigh especially..this is something which us annoying and I don't think we can enjoy watching night time and darker scenes. I would recommend the TV for this price point and I got it for 36k with 3 years of warranty so it's actly a deal breaker for me and anyone who is getting for this price I will definitely recommend considering the other good feature of the TV except the dark scene display issue.",
            "Satisfied!!!\n\nSometimes you take your decisions on your instincts rather than advices and you hit bang on. Buying Marq has been a similar experience,there were no reviews on this particular model as it was launched during the sale day but at 36k(includes additional warranty)it was too lucrative to be missed. Here\u2019s my experience after 10 days of observation-\n\nDelivery-\nFaster than expected. The delivery period was 14 days , I got it on the 4th day.\n\nInstallation-\nThe Jeeves technician was really helpful as installing the TV on WALL Mount at my home was little complicated but he did a real good job on it.\n\nService-\nAgain the same technician had visited when I had requested a service visit as I had some doubts about the picture quality and he helped with the settings which improved the picture quality much better.\n\nPicture quality -\nGood but could be better. One may not find the same effects as a Sony or Samsung or Lg but I would say Marq has done a pretty good job considering the price point and other factors.\n\nSound-\nTo the mark, in-fact better than I had expected. No need to have an additional sound bar.\n\nConnectivity-\nWas pretty smooth and had no issues at all.\n\nHD and 4K content-\nOn the set top box watching HD content is really good but SD is a disappointment. HD on internet with decent speeds is just fine. Regarding UHD4K, as far my knowledge goes our we still don\u2019t have much content on our set-top box and if you plan to watch it on internet one needs to have at-least 25 mbps speed to see the true effects. Even Netflix which has UHD content is unable to show until you have very high speed internet at home.Unfortunately I don\u2019t have it so I cannot comment on it yet.\n\nFinal verdict-\nIf you are a common layman like me who does not go into too much integrities of picture quality,sound and other features this is just the right product. Also note that at this price this is definitely a steal and it also helpful if you plan to change your TV faster to keep up with the new technologies in the market.",

My lappie with SSD boots up faster than this TV\n2) Playstore has limited app support (I dont mind as I dont use netflix)\n3) True HDR is missing (8 bit panel just cant do it .. sorry)\n\nAll in all I recommend the product for sheer value of money... In 2-3 years anyways QLED will takeover the market. So can be purchased for the interim period.",

            "Worst Product I have ever bought .. First time i bought unbranded product and suffering . Total waste of money , with in 6 months, Mother board changed.. Panel need to be changed, regardless of talking about changing remote.. My suggestion to all viewers .. never ever trust unbranded things, they come cheap.. but actually the money one spends on these goes waste. Better to add few thousand and buy better quality product. At least you have peace of mind and you are proud of your buy.",

It's very restricted and limited APP is available. streaming video hotstar and sunnxt. better use Amazon firestick.\n4. 48 second to power on the TV.\n5. fixed stand comes with box but problem for physical connectivity as points are backside of the TV. so needs to buy tilt wall stand costing 2500 in Flipkart. support 32 to 55 inch TV.\n6. video clarity is not good for normal video. always recommend for 4K video or HD.\n7. Bluetooth remote is good.\n8. built-in in Chrome cast is good and can mirror mobile and YouTube. didn't checked other apps.\n9. lagging and slow problem is there for watching video post mirroring the phone\n\nmy recommendation is TV is worth for value of as compared to branded 4k TV like Sony, LG, etc.\n\nI bought it for 39K + 2.5K for tilt stand + 4K for Amazon firestick. can use ups if voltage fluctuation are there which will cost 2.7K\n\noverall cost will become 50K is worth.",

There is a light bleed from top left corner and it is really disturbing once you notice it. The technician who came to inspect it did not notice it and they asked me to send a video.\n2. The customer service never works.\n3. You cant adjust the video settings(brightness, contrast etc) while watching youtube or sonyliv etc.. you have to go the one of the inputs, select menu and change video settings and comeback home, open the app and check if the settings are correct for you.\nIf they are not good you have to repeat the process. This is endless nonsense (What kind of engineers made this TV?)\n4. A lot of people mentioned that sound is great. Its loud and its surround effect is good but believe me this is not clean sound (bass sucks).\n5. Be careful, TV does not come with return policy. It is replacement policy. They will not refund, only replace and that too with in 10 days. Altougth it is my fault not to notice this, Frankly this is hypocrisy as Flipkart now owned by Walmart definitely has different returns policy in US.\n6. Media player other than what is preinstalled will not play the content (ex: movies on your hard drive, if you try to play it with VLC player or MX player etc..)\n7. NO sound for files with DTS.\n8. Motion rate seems too fast to me ( Like LGs true motion) while playing stored content. You cannot change it.\n\nIf you want to get a headache everytime you watch, go ahead with this junk.",

The person who came for the demo had very little knowledge about the product and features and was facing the issues while the initial setup. The demo given was just a formality.

            "Utterly disappointed with the after-sales service provided by Jeeves which apparently is partner for Flipkart. I had a pretty disappointing experience. My Television I purchased it 2 years ago and suddenly it showed some sort of issues with the screen. The screen had got dull all of a sudden. Since at the time of purchase we bought an extended warranty of 2 years, I contacted Jeeves to get my television repaired. To my surprise, the technician who came to attend my television ended up damaging my product even more. Since my issue wasn\u2019t resolved, Jeeves personnel came and took my tv claiming they\u2019re taking it for repairs of the product. To point out some facts, the number which they mention on the extended warranty section of Jeeves website is legit a scam since they redirect you back to Flipkart and not answer you properly. To sum up my experience, I did not get my TV yet, and also I don\u2019t expect fraudsters like Jeeves to even return my product anytime soon. So the product will last you for couple of years, depending on your luck. Since these brands aren\u2019t reputed and backed up by Flipkart, doesn\u2019t give them the right to cheat consumers. So it\u2019s totally on your risk that you buy this product. Hope my review will help some innocent buyer who intends to spend their hard earned money on such a cheap, low class brand and product.",
