            "Received the 50 inch model of Realme 4k TV on 09/06/2021 (As they Promised).\n\nABOUT FLIPKART'S SERVICE:-\n1st- Unlike its competitor, Flipkart offers an open box delivery. So, at the time of delivery, you can confirm if their is any damage/problem in the unit. Hats off to Flipkart for this kind of service.\n2nd- Unlike its competitor, Flipkart takes care of Installation. Though they can't able to keep the promise of same day installation, the installation has been done on very next day (i.e. on 10/062021). The installation guy is well experienced with polite behaviour. Very much satisfied.\n\nABOUT TV :-\nAs per my opinion, picture quality of the TV is very good. Though I have no chance to compare it with other TVs of same range. The Very good thing is the Hands Free experience (The \"Ok Google\" Thing). I have not connected the DTH or Cable Connection, fully dependent on Wifi Internet connection. No problem is faced till now. No light bleeding issue has found. I need more time to explore more. Till now its a good experience.",

Received yesterday.\nThe Best in this price range.\nDisplay quality is really awesome no need to think again.\nsound quality is also V good.\nConnectivity and performance is very good.\nFully Satisfied with the product.\ninstallation done at the next of delivery and good service by technician in decent manner.\n\nMany times seen you tube reviews about this product quality. After installing I just known the product is really worth every penny. its a new happiness to your home with new technology. looks like theater at home. go for it.",
            "My Honest review .\n\n1)Picture quality is really good even with sd channels.\nColur production is high and brightness is also high.\nI suggest to keep picture mode on \u201cmovie\u201d mode so u can see some natural type colur.\n2)sound would be better but ok . Bass is not so cool there is no thump in bass,if u manually set it in setting .I suggest to keep dolby atmos off and dts truvolume on then u can see major change in volume.\n3)i hv sony sa d40 sound system but it doesn\u2019t connect to tv don\u2019t know why it connects via Bluetooth but can\u2019t listen anything. Disappointed here only.\n4)remote is osm, hands free google is fluent.\n5) internet connectivity is best\n6) lag free interface\n7)android phones can easily use mirror screen but ios is bit difficult.\n\nOverall great purchase for me.

            "First, after two days of using TV, I saw that one USB port is not working properly then I call service center and he try to fix it but couldn't. Finally I replaced the TV. Now I am giving reviews of this. Firstly best in this price range. Amazing picture quality and also audio quality. Wi-Fi & Bluetooth connectivity is very good. I liked it the most the hands-free voice control through the Google Assistant features, I give simple commands to it for easy control. So I highly recommend it.",
            "1) Amazing Picture quality\nThe colours are really worth spending money and the very very clear display and has focused perfectly on edges ..but sometimes the the skin tones in the picture varies.\n2) Sound is quite loud but quality of sound could have been better ..with Dolby Atmos\n3) Connectivity is the thing Android TVs are bad at but the dual band WiFi is quite good and Bluetooth is the best I've seen in a TV. But wifi sometimes has shown the problem not while connecting but disconnecting\n4) The best thing is the hands-free Google Assistant ..\nYou can use it as a google home . The best experience with it. Remote sometimes lags which i consider normal.",
            "I am writing this review after using the tv for 10 days and I must tell you that you will not find a tv better than this at this price range. Hands down this the best tv in this segment and you do not need to go for any other tv. I had earlier used both VU's premium android and MI 4x tv and this tv stood out from both of them. I can go and write a whole essay of how cool this unit is but you must know one thing before buying this unit.\nThis tv does not support 5G wifi. I have a latest technology wifi system and yet it does not connect with the tv. Although the tv specifications say that it is compatible with 5G wifi but it is not. I had to use the tv with an ethernet (LAN) cable. That's why I am not giving this tv full 5 stars. I tried calling both flipkart and realme to provide a solution for this but they blatantly say that it is not possible now. With 4G wifi it is okay to use. It did connect to 4G wifi and worked completely fine.",

So no 4k content. 1080P tv is better than this mess. All you can do with this 4k TV is play YouTube in 4k. No other paying streaming app.\n\nVery disappointed.",

Don't just judge quality by connecting local cable in standard definition (SD) quality.\n\n** Now you can even watch apple TV+ content by installing \ud83c\udf4eTV app from play store. Dolby vision, Dolby sound and HDR content. Enjoy full potential of TV",
            "Picture quality awesome\nSound was good but not at its best\nInitially connectivity issues were there...but now not facing such issues\nChromecasting works fine but not so accurate\nProcessor response was impressive.... Swapping to apps was quite easy....noticed only negligible lags\nOverall a worthy buy.....",
            "Realme Smart TV\nPros: Better quality\nBetter sound clarity\nDolby and DTS support\nCons: Worst service installation vice\nThe settings gets changed everytime like when changed to Dolby after a day you open the tv and finds that it has been disabled not Dolby or dts is working...\nThe RAM is getting filled up pretty easily like I got the product and I used it for two days and when tapped the settings it shows that only 700mb is left of storage of ram, So ram management is poor...\nBut anyways I got a 4k tv at 22k after a exchange process so yeah this TV is worth every penny but buy the 43 inch bcoz for 50inch they are charging 40k becoz for 40k you can get much more better TV with higher specs....\nHope it helped",
            "Totally worth for its price... Go for it...\n\nDisplay is excellent...\nUI is snappy no noticeable lag...\nConnectivity is good...\nSupports Dolby vision and Atmos...\n\"OK Google\" voice assistant is really good makes everything simple...\nSound is ok for small rooms...using sony speaker good quality output with Bluetooth connection...\n\nNote : Screen bleeding in corner is there, but not a issue every led tv even sony & samsung will have this issue... But only visible in full black screen otherwise no...\nREAD MORE",
            "Value for money \ud83d\udcb0 worth investment. On electronics I personally feel we should not invest more. In offer I have purchased this TV in 26749/- This 4K TV has all the features which is value added thing for this price range. Overall superb and recommended\ud83d\udc4d\nFlipkart please improve your delivery service..I know logistic team is responsible for delivery of produt but I have experienced that Flipkart has no control on logistic 4-5 times experienced delay in delivery.\ud83d\ude0c Take a proper corrective and preventive action to avoid the delay in future.",
            "Good purchase. Fast delivery and installation.\nGood picture quality. Good brightness. Adequate sound. Fast boot up. Good performance as of now.\nWill update long time review.",
            "Firstly, I went for this product purely on instinct. Friends suggested IFalcon and TCL ones which have similar specs at a lower price but the handsfree Google Assistant feature drove me into buying this.\n\nFirst Impression\nGreat Display and Great sound. The colors are punchy and vibrant and thats all you need to have a good viewing experience. The sound quality is also good and it can get quite loud. I've seen many YouTubers claim that the display is not bright enough and the sound is average but that's not the case. Couldn't find much content that has Dolby vision but watched Loki on Hotstar with Dolby vision and it was amazing.\n\nHands-free Google\nIt might not work well if you have a noisy environment like a road-facing room with constant honking but it works well otherwise. It can turn on/off the TV and also control the volume so it's handy when you are eating and don't want to touch the remote with oily hands.\n\nInterface\nIt's a typical android interface that adheres to minimalism. If you like stock android, you'll like it. It has google play store so you can install any android app that has a TV version. Boots up really fast.\n\nBuild quality\nBuild quality is good and doesn't feel cheap at all. The bezels are very thin and give an immersive experience. The remote is also cute with that yellow ring at the center of the dial. Stands are plastic with a metallic finish and look premium.\n\nOverall Feedback\nIt's a good product. Comes with Android 10 out of the box so can expect a few more years of updates. Buy it for the display and you won't be dissatisfied.\n\nPro tip: Dolby sound is turned off by default and has to be enabled from the settings.\n\nThe installation guy was kinda pushy about buying the extended warranty but that can be ignored as it's a one-time thing.",
            "Amazing Amazing 4k Display, Picture Quality is Excellent, Sound is Best, Connectivity is amazing WiFi very very fast I never seen this type of best 4K TV",
            "Its best under 30k budget.\nColor gamut >90%DciP3 is real and display is awesome.\nBrightness is good enough.\nViewing angles are really really good.\nAudio is ok.\nPower on time and ui speed is ok.\n1080 to 4k upscaling is ok.\nBut 4k streaming is really good.\n\nOverall better than any other tv under 30k.",
            "Picture quality great for this range...sound is OK.. actually I had Sony Bravia before this,else everything is good ,Realme is doing great in terms of mobile and TV.. Review given after two months use.",
            "Worth It Product In that Price range. I suggest you all go for it. Best 4k Android LED under 30k",

Hopefully the durability of the performance is also good.\n\nJust go for it, if you want a Budget 4K Smart TV!",

            "Value for money product... and better than mi and any other budget tv present in the market. Picture quality is exceptional. Sound quality is good for lyrical but not so great for listening songs(bass could have been better). Overall A great tv if you are looking for a budget tv in 40k range.",
            "Excellent picture quality and enough sound for room but if you want to play music need extra speaker but over all good product and pocket friendly price .",
            "Enjoying the experience. Received prompt delivery. Installation was easy and quick too. Connectivity is fine, Picture quality is good too. Sound is ok. I'll Prefer using sound bar or other external speakers. One most important thing is not to pair bluetooth headphones & bluetooth remote simultaneously as there is connectivity issues & sound will break. I faced this issue & was about to return the TV thinking of it as fault of TV but when I unpaired remote the prb was solved. So use remote via IR.",
            "Budget best TV good product prices hike best price 25999/- picture quality and sound quality is good",
            "Its been 3weeks I bought this tv. My side of reviews are, See the price and expect only the things you can get for a budget. Don't expect more from the term Dolby vision, if you want to experience the true Dolby vision cinema try to buy a Sony or LG tv which has dolby vision, also it will cost twice or thrice than this TVs price. So the conclusion is it is a good tv not great but you can experience some feel good things in it for this price point. Sound quality is totally fine no need of additional sound bars. Coming to picture quality I will give 4 out of 5. If your budget is under 30k and you need a 4K tv surely go for it.",
            "The tv is best worth of money.the picture quality,sound quality is excellent demo and installation by Jeeves expert was good",

Connected my speakers through bluetooth.\nDon't trust any negative review about lower nits and low brightness level. Trust me brightness at half level is more than sufficient with too much lighting in room.\nGo for it... You will not regret.",

First there's no bass on the TV \ud83d\udd0a and then there's no Aux Connectivity so you will have to get a Speaker system with Optical Connectivity or Bluetooth one. I had been using My Old Sony Hone Theatre as it still rocks the building on its own but now I think I might have to change.\nAll in All it's a good product at this range.\nWill update if I see any other Matter worth Noting.\nAs of 04/07/2021\nNo Aux Connectivity for Audio.",

In the past Flipkart has ensured installation on the same or next day of delivery.

Fast app installation.\nClear sound\nGoogle assistant works great\nGood 5Ghz wifi connectivity speed\nDual band wifi\n\nCons\n\n1. Display is a mixed bag. Works well and is bright enough with accurate colors in movies or series on applications like Netflix, Prime, Sonyliv and Discovery etc.\n\nIs dark and has garish colors on the home screens for the TV itself and the same apps like Netflix, prime, YouTube etc.\n\nIt's kinda strange but it is what it is.\n\nThe screen could have been brighter for sure overall\n\n2. Extended Warranty : the TV has a 1 year overall warranty and 2 years warranty on the screen from manufacturer. So basically, your extended warranty starts at the end of the 1 year of manufacturer warranty. Summing up to a total of 3 years of warranty overall.\n\nIn all you end up losing out on the 1 extra year of screen warranty if u do the math.\n\n3. Installation timeliness",

Sound is ok but bass is not there. This could have been improved.\n4. Delivery was fast by Flipkart even during sale days.\n5. Installation took 3 days which was difficult for me to wait but the guy was professional.\n6. Design is fine like any other TV.\n\nSpecial- Google integration is nice and hands-free operation works like magic. Good thing is you can switch on/off without using remote.\n\nSummary- Worth the price. Go for it. Don't expect anything like sony but definitely in the price its worth it. For people looking to compare with MiTV, I also have MiTV and this one is far better than Mi interm of connectivity and speed.\n\nRest -More will update after few days of usage.\n\nEdited after day 1 usage - Fast moving scenes comes with little flickering. So reduced 1 star.",

            "I've purchased The Realme Smart TV 4K coz it was value for money TV. Exchanged my old TV with this which was 1080p. I have to admit the panel in this tv and also at this price point is great. It's very bright well that can be adjusted as per your like...For the speakers well it's good but there's very little bass so I also bought a Realme Soundbar which is like the best combo with this TV! As for connectivity there's no problem. At the back it has plenty of ports to connect with and also the blutooth connection is also great if you want to watch content on wireless headphones.\nIf there's something which i think could be better is the software optimisation. Idk about others but mine is a bit laggy sometimes also the volume toggle animation doesn't show sometimes so there are some bugs in this TV so realme have to do better in this regard!\nI won't complaint about the build quality coz they're already offering a lot of good stuff in it so I'm fine with it.\nDelivery executives were very kind and helpful as well so yeah if you want a budget 4K TV then go for it!",

I would suggest this one for better screen n picture quality. Though I get some difficulties while casting with castplay app but Google Home app did it very simple. By all means it is worth buying.

Guess what i was surprised with the features it has..\n\n1. Probably the best google voice assistant remote this tv has.\n2. Though the dolby system is not that effective but the sound clarity of this product is quite good with 24 watt\n3. Ultra HD 4K quality makes it perfect for movies\n4. Features and Android updates are quite good.",

Then i go with this because of brand value and even i heard more then Vu. So i bought this.\n\n2. It supports 5Ghz and 2.4Ghz.\n3. It has 16GB of ROM and 2GB RAM and by this it's too comfortable for me to use this.\nSome pre install application is there and play store too so you can install other applications too from there.\n4. Sound quality it's awesome and even i am also surprised with that sound is decent for a room.\n5. Picture quality is also good and even more then my imagination.",

            "Overall good experience. Colours are good. Rest features are good too.\nBut one thing which I have noticed is that you have to customize the picture and sound profiles to get best experience.\nSo from my experience, for video, switching on movie mode from Dolby vision works best in most scenarios. The warmth is sometimes a bit extra though.\nFor audio, switching to dts sound mode with tru volume option works best for cable tv. The human voices become distinct in this mode.",

As per mine point of view Realme won. But mine brother asked me to buy MI I told him that it's too common tv and even I compared but Realme won and I want to buy Realme tv but then too he forced me to buy MI and unhappily I purchased ordered MI tv then 2days before delivery I cancelled my order and suddenly I ordered Realme when he saw the features, performance he was just shocked.\nAnyways, Thankyou Realme and Flipkart.",

Also the picture quality is good for online platforms and not for typical setup box sd channels. 4k videos Play really well. Sometimes oversaturation of colors happen but mostly if the video quality is good then the display in TV is also great. Also the 24W sound is sufficient . The software experience is good not much lags. Could have provide more features like MEMC and 4k upgradation. Connectivity is ok but when connected to ethernet not getting full speed don't know the exact issue is it due to TV or ethernet cable. Also it supports dual band WIFI but its range is poor and can't connect far away routers. Overall at 25k I don't think there is any other better 4k TV at this time.\n\nAlso flipkart delivery and installation was as mentioned good work flipkart.",

I guess this is a default disadvantage of Android TV's, in which case, you will need to Turn off the TV completely.. This happened to me 2-3 times.",
