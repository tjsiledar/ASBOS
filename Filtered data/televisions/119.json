            "Here is the detailed review of realme SLED\nEarlier I have use normal LED and QLED TV. So the review we will be according to that.\nDisplay- if we compared to normal LED it is far far ahead of that. In comparison to QLED, this TV is directly giving the competition to it. Hence it can go against Q LED TV at lower price range.\n\nAudio- for a normal living room 24 watt sound output it is perfectly balanced since it comes along with Dolby audio and quad speakers, it's a good choice rather than 50 Wa...\nREAD MORE",
            "Pros:\n1) Very Slim bezels.\n2) Amazing picture quality.\n3) Blacks and whites have been seperated well.\n4) Sound quality is more than good and loud for normal usage.\n5) Stock Android ui and easy to use remote.\n6) Good wifi, bluetooth connectivity standards and sufficient ports.\n\nCons:\n1) Lacks Dolby vision but has chroma boost inbuilt so compensates somewhat.\n2) Lacks Dolby Atmos but has Dolby Audio but soundbar is required for completely cinematic experience like realme also advertises.\n3) By default the whites are too bright that dynamic range suffers in some areas but can be easily fixed in settings.\n4) Ports position could have been more accessible.\n5) Newer version of Android TV should have been there as already 11th version is out and it has 9.\n6) Or atleast 2 Gb ram should have been provided as memory management of Android TV 9 version isn't as good as newer versions. But not a huge noticeable difference due to good processor. Hopefully it would be updated to newer versions soon.\n\nOverall modern looking TV with awesome display quality and audio is decent, as well as accompanied by stock Android and Chromecast.",

            "Initial impressions of this tv are awesome. 24W speakers are more than enough. But still if u need more sound then go for realme 100W sound bar which will definitely boost the sound.

You call in realme store. Wrote our complaint and said that the engineer will repair such TV in your house in five days. After five days the engineer came to repair the TV and the TV did not work again. The same problem again. But so far no one came to our house and the TV in our house has been off for the last three months. There is no solution to the problem. Even after complaining frequently, our problem has not been solved and now we do not see such repaired TV. Can you refund the full amount of TV or give us a new TV because you have sent me a damaged TV because three The current TV has been off for the last three months today. This has caused a lot of questions in my house as well.

On the whole, for what you're paying it's more than worth it!\n\nUpdate (after 5months): the UI can become sluggish at times. TV hangs every now and then as well.
