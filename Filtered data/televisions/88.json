            "Very impressive picture quality .Good color balance and video presets are available unlike some tv's where colors are more defined for watching soaps and reality shows(by default). Connectivity is great. Connets to 2.5 as well as 5ghz wifi band . Remote operation is intuitive. Software experience is good. There is no voice asistance ( only available in pro i think) but its not a deal breaker for me.\nThe hdfc cashbacks and flipkart plus discounts makes it a very lucrative deal.\nSound is overall good but at some points feels like voice could have been crispier. Overall a good buy for cinematic experience.",
            "Picture - 10/10\nSound - 9/10\nConnectivity - 9/10\nGuys please go for voice assistant enabled tv otherwise you will have to press lot more buttons than usual and that is a big problem . Rest everything is great as expected. The picture is great , sound is good for 120 sq ft room . All features are user friendly and operates with ease.",

            "Great deal, I am satisfied with this Product. Purchased after a research, Sony is much Expensive. Sorted Lg, Mi, vu. Finally selected the latest one from Samsung. Only disappointment is low quality plastic at back side, but its trifling.\nIf wall mounted connectivity become difficult.

            "I want to thank Flipkart for seamless TV exchange experience. This is very different from the earlier impression while exchanging old product on Flipkart had challenges. Good improvement in this aspect, looks like Flipkart has taken people's feedback positively on exchange policy. My only little complain from Flipkart is the technician who came to install the TV didn't had good knowledge of TV function.\nPros:\nSamsung crystal UHD TV picture quality is really outstanding. Liked the picture upscaling of SD content to HD. It gets closer to Sony picture quality. Easy to navigate to OTT platform on Tizen OS. Sound quality is good. Samsung plus enables free streaming for few channels like Republic, Bloomberg don't need dth connection for those channels.\nCons:\nHotstar is not streaming at 4k content don't know why Samsung has kept it aside. Hope Samsung would fix this issue by software update. 3.5 mm audio jack missing. Free storage space is only 2 GB.\n\nOverall satisfactory experience so far.",
            "It is an awesome tv with superb picture quality and amazing details.SOUND could have been better but considering all other Chinese brands' picture quality, this is a heavenly good tv!!!!\nAlso not to mention the service experience it was very good!!!!!",
            "I had to choose between samsung and other brands like LG, Kodak, Vu. Ultimately went with samsung for peace of mind. Picture and sound quality is great. With a good internet connection, the picture quality is amazing and connectivity is not an issue barring the need to end the app in ipad and restart to airdrop the content. Use smart things to connect your tv to google home and use your mobile as remote. The 43 inch tv makes it easier to use it from my bedroom too. Loving it",
            "Super quality awesome experience best quality TV Samsung I love it",
            "The tv has very good picture quality and good colour reproduction but the ving angle as not so good compared to my previous LG TV. It's also really good for gaming using console. Sound is also decent if you toggle some setting you can amplify the audio.I didn't feel any lag issue it's running smoothly.",
            "Good TV in all respect but only one think missing that is Legacy support for AV connectivity with cables for old system which dont have HDMI. Wall mount is not provided in box but is provided free during installation.\nPicture 10/10\nSound 7/ 10 Bass could be better at this price range.\nDurability 9/10\nApplications 8/10 No customizable homescreen. But its good by default.\nConnectivity 7/10 as no AV input is provided and if you dont have HDMI then have to buy a converter.\nUser interface : 8/10",
            "Outstanding TV go for it ..many AAP's is not supported only issue superb picture quality just awesome... After using it 2 months i realise that tv picture quality is superb at this price but one thing I regret the most is tyzen processor which makes the tv very slow , tyzen processor not fast like android tv ,, it took much more time ro open apps or anything than android tv , so I use a mi android box with this tv tyzen processor is disgusting but picture quality at this price is mind blowing",
            "Nice tv and with VA panel but clearlity is good and side view also good ......but if u have old box of tata sky and it have no hdmi port soo u need to purchase it and then u connect ur tata sky box with this tv and used it .....",
            "Awesome tv and good delevery service by ekart.. installation Engineer was also a nice and helpful person ..I bought it 29400 ... thanks alot filpkart",
            "The TV was delivered and installed in 1 day which is unheard of. The installation and demo was extremely smooth!!\n\nTV Pros\n\n- Anything above 1080p, especially 4k quality is brilliant (content on YouTube and Netflix)\n- Sound is decent. Would need a soundbar if you want more bass.\n- Booting time is non existent. Changing picture settings and seeing how it looks real time is helpful\n- Did see some motion blur/lag effect while watching football. This is easily fixed by lowering \"Juddering\" Under picture settings\n\nCons\n\n- Couldn't see any 4k content on Prime video. Not sure if this an issue on prime or Samsung TV in general.\n- If the picture quality is set to \"Dynamic\", the white balance is slightly blown. Can be fixed as well.",
            "Tv is good, u should go for upper variant with voice search support remote.\nMy panel got some black spots after 6 months so I contacted samsung service center they replaced my complete pannel at my home.\nAll together good one.",
            "picture quality is the basic necessity for a tv for which this product does a complete justice. so go for it blindly for picture quality. The motion smoothing effect is awesome and main highlight which comes in high budget tv's, so it is no less than it. completly happy with the purchase hope it will work for atleast 5 years",

            "Excellent picture quality",
            "This order is like nightmare for us. TV delivered by Flipkart on time but no one came for installation from Samsung even after 7 days. They are just making fool. No professional attitude from Samsung.\nAnd worst part there is they do not bother to contact you. There is no direct contact to them and if try to call toll free number, never connect.\nWe believe in Flipkart but even multiple promise made by Flipkart no real action. They initially told that it will be installed by maximum of 9 July,...\nREAD MORE",

Samsung store has limited apps, it even does not have the basic apps listed there.\n\n3. This model doesn't have Google Voice assistant support, with this model Samsung should have given that atleast.\n\n4.
