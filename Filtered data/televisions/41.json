Fantastic.\n\nLG: Installed ~26 hours after delivery. A night delayed than first intimated by them. No big problem that but has to be mentioned. Problem, I only wanted table mount, on casual enquiry, technicians said wall mount would cost Rs 1200 whereas it's free obviously. Ha! And I wasn't given a standard wall bracket, whether I am owed one even if table mounted couldn't get clarified.\nPoor from LG. Beware.",

Only WiFi is available and the connectivity is great.\nSince it runs webOS, although they give prominent apps to download, there is no vast library of apps like android does.\nRest all is great. I love it.",
            "Nice TV. Working fine. Very Good picture quality. Enough sound. No bluetooth but it has 3.5 mm headphone jack. Web OS is little boring. I am using Nokia media streamer with this TV and all my problem like Android OS, bluetooth, Google chromecast, playstore support, Google voice assistance etc. are solved now. Moreover I bought this TV in this Big billion sale at very good discount. Totally Value for money product. LG brand has largest customer support service centre in INDIA.

The delivery was done as promised and installation was done within a few hours of the delivery. This Full HD Smart TV met my expectations in terms of brand, price (30K), picture, and sound. I have not come across any other good brand TV at this price. The picture looks great and also the sound the quality/volume. The standard remote was also easy to use for Smart TV apps.",

City cable wont be able to provide much better quality.\n\nI got this product wen it was quoting at 31000..so got a instant discount of 2000 and 5% cashback after 3 months.ordered from flipkart axis bank credit card.\nFinal-27550",

App support and internal storage are a let down. Navigating thru app and settings with the provided remote is little bit difficult. But, if u want to use it is as \"TV\" alone, it's a good value for money device.\nInstallation was done on the next day of delivery. They even provided wall mount even though I didn't mount it on wall.\nKudos to LG",

Though i heard we can use a usb hub and connect many usb drives to over come the usb problem. Webos is very interesting for the TV but the app support of webos is not that great(All major ott platforms are available except sonyliv and jiocinema as of writing this review).But in future we cant expect all the new ott apps to the content store as it is dependent on app developers to provide apps for old webos and LG wont provide any webos updates for their tvs.Over all a decent buy if you are looking for LG FHD tvs.",
