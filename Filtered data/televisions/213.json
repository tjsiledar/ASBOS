            "Very good TV at low price. Picture and sound clarity is so nice. It has a high quality speakers and no sound bar or home theatre is required for medium size halls as the speakers are powered with Dolby Atmos. When come to picture quality the depth of the colors are very good and mainly it gives a very good viewing experience in dark room with the decent brightness.\nWatching 4K videos in YouTube and from other OTT platform, this tv is just Wow. Wow.. When i played high size videos (6GB and above) through hard disk, I observed some lagging.\nThis TV has come with pre installed apps such as YouTube, Netflix, Prime video etc. Only problem is that this smart tv doesn't have some important Indian apps which are available in Android TV.\nWall mount bracket was included in the package along with table top stand. The guy who had come for installation didn't charge any additional cost. Totally it was nice shopping experience with Philips and Flipkart.",

            "Front and side bezel design is far better than LG, Samsung and Sony. Picture quality is also at par with leading brands. Sound is okay neither good nor bad.\nWanted to go for 65\" android but that wasn't in my budget and I have Tata sky Binge+ so for me it didn't matters.\n\nBest in this price range, will recommend all to go for this.\n\nInstallation : was a bit delayed by 3-4 days but that may be due to local service centre. Philips India just have to have a quality service.\n\n5 stars for the product, 3 stars for installation\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc",

Sound quality is average, we are using external speakers anyway.\n\nApps are very limited ..just 3 to be precise YT, Netflix and Prime. Bummer if you want sonyliv and Disney hotstar..you will have to buy chromecast,firestick etc.\n\nTv startup is fast",

            "For this value this price you get a 58\" TV, it's not OLED it's not qled , but it's value for money LED TV, so far the experience is good, though no Bluetooth and voice control, that I knew before buying, saphi os is Linux based, so limited apps, casting is problem for some smartphones. TV is amazing for d2h cable and mild gaming.",
