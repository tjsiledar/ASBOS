            "Great product in the budget. Great picture quality with sound and connectivity. Do not go for a China product rather buy Panasonic. It's a very old brand from Japan and I like this brand. That bazel display is superb adding beauty to the android tv. Overall go for it.. Worth product..",
            "It was a blind guess for me. Was buying for my parents, taking my chances. They really liked it.\n* The bezels are very small for 20k tv, edge to edge, no protruding bezels.\n* 16W speaker, but the sound clarity is very good than expected\n* Haven't installed any apps other than Netflix, Prime. Because those are what my parents subscribed. Have no lag issues.\n* Very good viewing angles. Almost 180 degrees horizontally, vertically you'll be fine.\n* Comes with wall mount within box\n* Comes with Android 9, so, long app support time speaking technically\n* Classic non-compact remote. Will go easy for all ages.\n* Delivered on time, no issues with the piece till now, installation before given time. Good from Flipkart.\n\nCons:\n* Internal storage available for user is clipped to 4gb. Deal with it yourselves.\n* Price could've been a K less seeing it's jumping into 4K tv arena a bit with 20K tag.\n* For very large halls or home with many children, 16W speakers may sound slight a bit low. This may be knit-picking but yeah, that's it for now.",

            "A brand is always a brand... usually tv's process good (hd/uhd)quality video's content more better/clearer but this one does an Excellent picture processing even with low (SD setup box)quality content which does only by old players like sony,lg,samsung, panasonic etc.\n\nComing to sound, it is at next level when you enable \"Dolby audio processing\" option(attached image) in settings sound menu. A \"Refined audio codec\" is excellent and clearer audio which is miles away compared to new brand TV's.\n\nComing to connectivity, wifi connects smoothly and automatically as soon as I enable \"wifi hotspot\" in my mobile which is really cool thing. Connection stability is good for longer time without disconnection. Also patchwall experience is quick and fast.\n\nThrough bluetooth we can connect to headset/soundbars(A2DP sink) and listen a song through headset, also we can connect to mobile(A2DP source) and listen songs through TV audio speakers which is cool.\n\nMy con's:\n--This updated new smart remote has Google assistant feature which by default is not working.\n--flipkart delivered one day late by promised delivery date. Also 4-5days gone, still no installation guy visited.",

            "Awesome budget product by Panasonic!! I was looking for a good brand smart TV within limited budget. This product just feets the need with all required features for smart TV.

            "Overall the product is very good. I am happy with it. I get installation within 24 hours and the installation person is very good and sufficient professional, and I think which Is very good. Trusted brand and trusted product. This product is good but steel some software issues is visible and feel little bite of slow. Chrome cast screen is not working properly. But in this price range it's impressive.",
            "Fantastic product for thia range. Completely satisfied. Only issue with casting mobile phones. You cannot directly cast your phone. Chromcast is inbuilt but not satisfied with that. Picture quality is good. Sound is also good but not best. Overall value for money. I bought it nearly 26k. That is cheapest for this quality.",
            "Overall right from ordering the product to the delivery the experience was excellent. Flipkart site had all the required details to check on. After ordering - order status was updated frequently and the product was delivered ahead of time. However the TV installation team didn't turn up within 48 hours of the product delivery as was mentioned in at the time of order and took more than 48 hours though Panasonic installation team did send an sms that the Installation will be delayed but with no indication of the date and time. I had to follow up with the Flipkart customer support on this and once the ticket was created Installation was done within two hours. Installation team was courteous and professional. Team came and installed the product and also gave good briefing on how to use the product. They even followed up over the phone after the installation. Best part is that due to Covid - one didn't have to leave home for anything and it was all taken care of just sitting at home. Overall experience has been very good.",
            "Worth for money !\n\nI am giving this review after using this TV more than 3 months. As of now I didn't find any issues. Picture quality is awesome and Dolby audio and so are added values.. It's a magnificent one in this segment. GO FOR IT.",
            "Very Good TV. Came nicely packed and delivered in time. the installation engineers came on the next day. they were very helpful and taught us the handling procedures. the TV is working fine. Completely satisfied. thank you flipkatrt.....",
            "Best Tv with all the features.... Tv at best price..... Excellent picture quality.....best connectivity..... Everything best at low price....",
            "To be honest..\npicture quality is just only average\nSound quality is so nice\nConnectivity is not good\nOver all its nice big screen size..\nBut I'm not satisfy wity the picture quality.\nSo think and decide..",
            "Absolutely great product provide by panasonic.\nPicture quality is really good , i cant believe,bcz i m using samsung 5 series for last 5 years so i realize tht panasonic's clearity more clear than this.\nAndroid looks good.1 gb ram is nt powerfull but its sufficient.\nRemote control is also good quality.\nSlightly disappointed with speakers require 40 watts speaker like JVC. If u r bass music lover.otherwise its enough.\nBezel less display looks really premium.\nInshort u mist go for this panasonic model.\nBcz in 20000 its worth of every penny.",
            "Awesome TV I've checked almost every brand but I liked only Sony and Panasonic, ickily got Panasonic TV for reasonable price, I am fully satisfied with TV quality and Flipkart delivery & installation.\nThx Flipkart",
            "My review is after 3 months of using the product. Good picture quality but low sound for movie, you can't connect AUX cable enabled music system because it comes with digital audio connectivity, no 1 click picture mode, no 1 click sound mode, you have to close the running app like prime or Netflix and then go to settings to change the sound or picture mode then come back to the app to watch the movie so you can't monitor which mode is best for the current situation, after all it's from the ho...\nREAD MORE",
            "Good Product. Just a problem with the manual provided. It is not for the given product. Thus to understand what to do it is bit difficult. Good picture but poor sound. It's a fun TV with new features. Happy to buy this.\nBest service by flipkart. On time delivery same day installation. Really satisfied",
            "Product seems good at this price. But the person who came to do free installation and demo was not at all professional. Probably was greedy to take some money for the free service provided. Also was trying to market/sell other products like stabilizer, extended warranty by giving false details. Flipkart really needs to improve their tie-up with 3rd party vendors who can work professionally and who doesn't try to cheat end customers.",
            "Product delivered with good car and the technical assistance for mounting was on time and did a good job. Tv picture quality is good , sound is little bit an issue, u might need a sound bar if you are good quality music. Overall value for money worth buying.",
            "Beautiful product from house of Panasonic. Writing this review after 15 days of usage. Loving the product so far. Picture quality is awesome and sound is also good. All OTT apps are also working smooth.",
            "Reviewing after using it more than a month. Awesome picture quality. You have to set it up properly to get the best out of it. Sound is good enough for a medium size room 11*17. Software has little problem, you can not set picture and sound and check the effect alongside .. which is problematic. But considering price it is ok.",
            "Superb TV bought last year. Good Sound n clearity. Chromecast n wifi works perfectly",
            "Awesome product I like it very much.\nSound quality so good\nPicture quality also good\nConnectivity is also good",
            "Good TV under low budget. Installation done on time there is no hassles. Technician guide us properly & tell all the features. Good built Quality & picture is awesome. All apps are connected successful except mirroring.",
            "Great product at this price range, I'm very happy, support 60hz refresh rate, if you're using Tatasky change the picture settings at 1080i 60hz you will get great picture quality. I got this product at 19K",
            "Excellent product in this price range..picture quality is good and connectivity options are also good and easy..chromecast via some apps is good. You can also download apps from playstore supported for TV..",
            "Best buy under 20k for a 40\" smart Tv\nBrand value, connectivity, picture quality, sound, Best in this price range.\nGot it delivered in 2 days and the installation next day.\nBeen a month using this product, amazing experience and truly a value for money.",

They are horrible and no better compared to cheap quality Bluetooth speaker. I know it\u2019s a budget tv but that doesn\u2019t mean we are ready to accept cheap quality product like some low brand value company from Panasonic. If a brand like Panasonic is making tv with poor quality what\u2019s the point in choosing this over other unfamiliar brands when the quality is same.

Most of the apps are available on play store. Remote has hotkeys for netflix, YouTube n prime video.\nSound is load n clear but quality is not great as with every led tv.",

Dolby sound and 16 watt speaker is better than most of the 20 watt speakers. Go for it without hesitation\nThe installation person will keep on pursuing you to buy a separate stand from him for rs 1800 . In the market it won't cost more than 400. Don't go for it and ask him to install the TV with the original stand which is being provided free by Panasonic. Also he will tell you to buy 2 years insurance for rupees 3000.

But you may have any soundbar cost 4k and promise you love it because it supports Dolby atoms\n3) company didn't give any strong stand to wall mount it, I gave 500 from my pocket to installer for this\n\nFinally you may go for it in this price range(17000-18000)",

The best your money can buy in this size and range.\nI was however disappointed with the service of flip cart , there was no delivery service to a popular place like Ooty and when I personally requested them to just deliver the tv only without installation they refused and didn't even give me an alternative. I figured out delivery to Coonoor was the next best for me and got them to ship it to a friend's place in coonoor from where I picked it up . I did it all for Panasonic not flip cart",

Had blindly ordered this TV and shockingly the TV is excellent.\nFrankly, I wanted to avoid China product so removed the second choice from the cart. This product is manufactured and assembled in India by a Japanese company Panasonic.\nPicture quality and sound quality is nice. They provide wall mount kit with the TV so it saves your money. The wall mount is smartly designed to cut the cost. Only problem is there is hardly any space to plug in anything, but is can be resolved by taking out whole TV which is quite easy.\nAnother problem is - it does not come with 3.5mm audio jack but not an issue a the sound quality is good.\nOverall it the best choice if you want a 40\" TV within the budget of 22000.",

(18 days user)\n\nPoint :- display, sound, connectivity, build, remote and setoff box, play back.\n\n1) displays - super bright display, super cut clear picture quality ( online and usb offline videos) there is no need for 4k display for web content playback. 100% positive you will love display quality.\n2) sounds - there is no magic (like ss or Dolby sound) sound factor in this tv. It's basic also satisfying Bass is thare. Sound is too loud my hall room needs just 5% volume.\n3) connectivity -\nremote connectivity not once issue detected.\nWiFi connectivity routers needs to be in range 20 feet with not wall or others things in between both.\nWire connectivity no problem detected.\n4) build - it's Panasonic not chaina quality so be positive\nside frame very small gives premium look and feels good on wall mount. Remember one thing it's 40\" Tv so 6 to 10 feet distance needed. No more than that in my case 15 feet looks bit smaller to me.\n5) remote and setoff box - remote looks above average quality, easy to understand, slim and very few useful keys.\n\nSet off box, mine is SD+HD dish tv so HD channel no problem but in SD channel (few channel 5 to 10 channels ) is not looking good because it's wide panel. So 3 or 4 movie and 4 or 5 regional channel.\n6) Play back - smooth on dish channel. smooth for web 1080p 30fps and 60 fps.\n\nNo 4k side play or other way.\n\nHope u understand.\nThank you.",

            "1. Got it in big billion sales in 15099. Can't even imagine a panasonic within this price.\n2. First thing you will notice is the quality in picture. I have mi 40 inch as well and the panasonic shows why it is a panasonic. While mi at close distance with a SD connection pixelated panasonic holds it intact. SD connection too looks awesome in this tv.\n3. There is a composite jack on this tv and a rca (red, yellow, white) female to male comes with the package, so if your set top box is an old one that works with rca output, don't worry you can connect it with that cable and composite jack.\n4. You have an external sound system or home theatre then you can connect it with optical or hdmi cable. There is no 3.5 output in this tv.\n5. Netflix, prime and YouTube works flawlessly on this tv unlike my mi 40 inch which runs on patchwall and nothing works on that unless you do 'zugaad' downloading some other apps.\n6. Havent checked screen mirroring yet but connecting to wifi is super easy.\n7. I tried playing avi video format with usb, it didn't work and had to download VLC player, with VLC I'm playing almost all the formats.\n8. You will love the picture quality, it is way better than mi, hands down. And in this price range it is just unbelievable. I was thinking of oneplus 43 inch but good faith prevailed and went for this one instead which I will never regret.\n9. Flipkart delivery was awesome as usual. The installation was smooth. The wall mounts are two small screws on which the tv will basically hang. I went for a more sturdy one which the installation guy carried with him. Costed 1600 but the quality is super. You can get the wall mount within 1000 I believe.\n10. Many told about the viewing angle but I find it completely ok when checked it from the angle. It is as clear as you see it in 90. So no worries.",
