            "Just Supperb and premium....\nI was looking for hd Tv from one year. My many firend was suggesting me for MI tv as they are cheap and good in quality but when ever i start comparing all the tv thenthomson and vu has advance point. So i focused on Thomson and Vu. Some technical problem was raised in Vu tv's so i refuses the Vu. Then only focused on Thomson. Orderd at 21700 only with 5 offer's. Delivery on time and installed on the same day. Then i started satellite channels with hd and sd. Hd have crisp clear display and sd also has Supperb clearity.\nIf you are planning for a full hd tv(4k ultra hd) , don't go without 4k, then surly you can go to Thomson without any query. I have a long comparison with all the tv's.\n\nStrong sound (Removed my Creative woofer)\nSupper crisp clear view(ips pannel) Like i phone\nConnectivity is fast as you can't even see when it is connected. Once you have to connect with your network setting. In full hd video, movie, drama and serial very low net is consumed.\nThere is no any lag during screen mirroring. I am playing BGMI.\u263a\u263a\nNow i think that 43\" is small in size because no difference occured in clearity as same as 22\" old one has. So you should select 55\" and above.",

Because it has Bluetooth connectivity too.\nBelieve it or not I am using this one as a monitor and absolutely no strain on my eyes so far.\n\nWhat more do you need. BTW, I have owned a 55 inch Thompson with fantastic after sales support.\nGo for it!",

It shows more pinkish color effects in each video. Even though company claims that it has 30 watts speakers but base effect of these speakers is missing its been only one month since i purchased this tv but Its remote is not working properly. Its remote stopped working itself for few seconds in between and start working again.\nThis is my review after using this tv after one month. I hope it helps any in some ways",

Customer support is very bad even if you call them for the complaint they will ask you to write a mail and send and i have not gotten any reply from there end till date. Before buying this if you can handle the customer service which does not respond and have some patience with the wifi issue you can then buy this. if we talk about video and sound it is bery good you will enjoy hd and ulta hd content",

            "Picture quality is Awesome. Ips panel is great.\n4k Video Playing good in offline but while streaming 4k stucks.\nSound is Loud but quality is very average.\nNo Dolby atmos audio support, but that can be fixed by using VLC player.\nNo Picture Editing option while in the Android system, Every time needs to go to the AV or HDMI to set Brightness or anything.\nProvided wall mount is Not that great can be easily comes off.\nBut I would suggest everyone to go for UV 4k Tv for this price range maybe 1000 or 2000rs higher. Uv has Dolby vision and Dolby sound.\nThree star Because even the Installation guy says Thomson is not good and keeps getting complaints but VU mostly never gets complaint.\nWarranty services will be headache because they only accept Mail and we have to wait for the reply.",

My many firend was suggesting me for MI tv as they are cheap and good in quality but when ever i start comparing all the tv thenthomson and vu has advance point. So i focused on Thomson and Vu. Some technical problem was raised in Vu tv's so i refuses the Vu. Then only focused on Thomson. Orderd at 21700 only with 5 offer's. Delivery on time and installed on the same day. Then i started satellite channels with hd and sd. Hd have crisp clear display and sd also has Supperb clearity.\nIf you are planning for a full hd tv(4k ultra hd) , don't go without 4k, then surly you can go to Thomson without any query. I have a long comparison with all the tv's.\n\nStrong sound (Removed my Creative woofer)\nSupper crisp clear view(ips pannel) Like i phone\nConnectivity is fast as you can't even see when it is connected. Once you have to connect with your network setting. In full hd video, movie, drama and serial very low net is consumed.\nThere is no any lag during screen mirroring. I am playing BGMI.\u263a\u263a\nNow i think that 43\" is small in size because no difference occured in clearity as same as 22\" old one has. So you should select 55\" and above.",

Finally you can enjoy picture quality but no DTS sound. Buy this at cheaper price in any deals and buy good sound bar to enjoy full range.
