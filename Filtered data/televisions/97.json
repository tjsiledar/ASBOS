App store support, p.s you can add device like key board ans laptop via usb/HDMI cable, use it as big screen , only thing I would say dont use with a copper wire cable it will not do the justice with this tv. Use dish or internet based service , remote is amazing but i felt it could have been more snappy, you can play games from google play app and either u play online or dowload it, playing online is a better option..all in all its a must buy..",
