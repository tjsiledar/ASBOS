Even you need to purchase app for screen mirroring. I think they have to either use Android or just remove the smart tv feature and start selling the fire tv or chrome cast fre with tv. I am really not happy. All other connectivity is fine like connection with 3HDMI and USB.\n\nOverall thanks to Flipkart for a great delivery and installation arrangements...full marks, no issue, hassle free service, although box cover was dirty but that's ok.\n\nLooks of the TV is also great \ud83d\udc4d.",

            "\u2022Picture quality --->\n1. If you are playing native 4k uhd videos through USB or HDMI , it gonna blow your mind...4k videos are looking crystal sharp & supreme colour accuracy.\n\n2. If you are using set top box or DTH(majority of us are doing so) then do subscribe to the HD channels of the broadcaster. Because if you play a SD channel on this 4k screen the image output looks messy just for the vigorous upscaling. But in the other hand when you play a HD channels , TV needs to work less on upscaling. Then you can realise how much your TV can.\nNOTE 1: The upscaling of LG is very good (better than samsung wondertainment series)\nNOTE 2 : LG provides details picture profile settings by which you can set your visual experience according to you taste. Bcz visual experience is subjective.\n\nVisual experience = 5/5\n\n\n\u2022Audio quality --->\nBefore placing order i was worried about the term 20W \ud83d\ude05... because now a days some bt speakers are coming with more than RMS output of that. But LG provides various audio presets...they are better than my experience...i hardly could bump up the volume over 55%\ud83d\ude05. So don't just see that #20W\ud83d\ude05\u270c\ud83c\udffb.\n\nAudio experience = 5/5\n\n\n\u2022LG installation---\nI placed order = 20th March\nIt has been delivered = 22nd march (10am)\nIt has been installed = 22nd march (2pm) *wall bracket is free of cost.\n\n\nNote 3 --> you will not get magic remote out of the box , you have to buy it seperately.\n\n\nDon't hesitate place the order.\n\nThanks to flipkart & LG \ud83d\ude01",
            "First of all, blazing fast delivery by Flipkart. Delivered in less than a day. Installation and demo provided by LG within an hour from delivery. So hats off to LG support.\nFlipkart provided open box delivery option to verify any physical damage to the product.\nAbout the TV:\n1. A rather lengthy setup process but justifiable given all the features packed into it. Additional setup for Apple Airplay.\n2. OS required an update. After the update the UI is absolutely fluid. UI is intuitive, clutter free and crisp.\n3. The display is very well lit and bright enough. Great viewing angles. Impeccable picture quality.\n4. Sound output seemed rather timid. Could have been much better. Lacks that bass.\n5. There a lot of other options from newer brands offering better specs, but those will barely make a difference for an everyday user experience. Plus LG offers great customer service.\nOverall a great value for money product.",
            "Pros:\n1. It is DLED (Direct LED) which doesn't have any screen bleeding issues (White patches on the edges of the screen) like the ELED (Edge LED)\n2. 4K upscaling is doing decent work.\n3. Works with 4TB external drives\n4. Supreme color accuracy and image quality. Thanks to Active HDR mode\n5. Decent speakers with DTS/DOLBY sound. No need to buy a home theater if you are not a music lover.\n6. Apps response is smooth and fast. Hazel free UI.\n7. More connection ports\n\n\nCons:\n1. The panel is not IPS. The panel technology in this model named as \"Ultra Bright Panel\"\n2. Magic remote (for voice commands) needs to be purchased separately at extra cost 2k. But there is NO STOCK !!\n3. No bezel-less design\n4. Plastic stand\n------------------------\noverall rating 3/5",
            "Nice tv, definitely consider buying it.\nSound quality is 9/10 but you will not notice the difference.\nIt has airplay which Is a great advantage for apple devices.\nAmong Sony, Samsung and LG, you will not get better tv than this in price range of 60k.",
            "It was one of my best recent purchase.\nThe picture quality was up to the mark sound quality too was good enough.\nConnectivity as far as now it very good.\nIt's a good value for money product.\nUsed it only for about a day but as per the specifications it's a great TV for purchase.Worth it.\nThe delivery and installation was great no delay everything was delivered and installed by the scheduled time.\nHope Flipkart introduces debit card transfer facility (cod) on such huge purchases. The only drawback to the tv is that there is no aux audio output.",
            "It's a grt option over VU/hisense.\n\nPros : picture quality is grt in this price range.( Vu 50 in is more than 40 now.)\nBrightness is more than enough.\nBlack is perfect\nContrast is perfect.\nPicture modes are very useful.\nOs is awsm n fast. It's has all the necessary ott app we need.\nMagic remote is fun.(need to buy separately)\nGood viewing angle (having an va panel in 50\" only)\nNo soap opera effect.\nPanel finishing is good enough for the price.\n\nCons: sound output is not good.( I prefer picture quality over sound in any tv)\nIn some app like SonyLiv the streaming quality is not good.(fire stick streams with better quality)\nBezels are not thinnest\nFor 50htz refresh rate,u will see fome jitter in fast moving scenes. But won't bother u.\n\nGiven 4 stars for these cons.\nBuy if these cons are not important over grt picture quality for the price.",
            "My only concern is non availability of 3.5 mm jack and RCA connectivity. My home theater system is a bit old and doesn't support digital output so looking after alternate solutions to connect the same rest everything is butter smooth. Airplay & casting works like crazy smooth. Sound and videos( even HD) works great. Perfect value for money.",
            "Tv is delivered on time and installed before promised date..overall the tv is a good buy.. the remote provided with the tv is good and i personally did not miss magic remote.. go for it",
            "Let's get a couple of things straight.\n1. I'm generally too lazy to write a comprehensive review and\n2. I had an older, 32 inch LG LCD and my experience was terrible. I wanted to try it ONLY BECAUSE of my possible future purchase of an OLED. I wanted to choose between LG and Sony. I have a Sony full HD LED, purchased about three years ago.\n\nI was queasy about LG, and wanted to opt for something without 'brand value' as this buy was supposed to be a budget option. After constant searches and moments of indecision, I decided to opt for this one for the price and the added 10% off on HDFC cards as Republic Day sale was on.\n\nI was COMPLETELY ready to be underwhelmed; but my oh my! I couldn't BELIEVE my eyes as what I saw in terms of picture output was beyond satisfactory! The 4K is spectacular, and so is the FHD. The upscaling could use some work, and so does the audio, but DO CONSIDER the brand value AND the price point! The panel is uniform, there's no uneven backlight bleed, the black is as black as it should be on a panel of this range. I'm too lazy to append pics, but as a verified user please take my word for it. The picture output is beautiful PROVIDED you give the unit some time to 'break in', as it were. The overall viewing experience now is significantly better than what it was when it was first installed. Give it time.\nYou have PLENTY of connectivity options, and the 2.5 Ghz bandwidth works like a charm. Just get yourself a good router and you'll see. The unit is also extremely helpful in making sense of the cluttered file system of my ext. HDD which I was SURE it won't play, as there were so many different kinds of files. But it did. The responsiveness is something you need to feel to understand.\n\nCon? Well, that HAS to be the remote. The magic remote is no longer easily available (I have this impression that it's not available AT ALL) and if you want to experiment with internet and Netflix and other streaming services, well...you'd be in for BIG trouble. Using the remote that comes bundled with the unit is a...profound pain in the rear!\n\nNothing else, really. It has been a fantastic purchase, a decision that I take pride in! LG 43UM7290PTF is one stunning piece of TV unit (considering the price point; NEVER forget that most important bit while being judgmental) and you won't repent the decision of opting for it!",
            "The biggest minus of this tv is web os. The apps are all web apps, inbuilt storage is very less. Remaining all are pretty good for normal use. I am using firetv stick with this tv which satisfies my smart tv needs. Doesn't support exfat, had to format my ssd to NTSC",
            "Picture quality and sound is okey for the price. Great connectivity support. Like there is no issue in casting youtube app from phone ,laptop and mobile display but there was no option to cast from prime video app. This was the only let down in terms of connectivity.\nOverall great SMART TV for the price.",
            "its really awesome experience for me In Tirupathi hub they have treated me like a vip very polite and great respect they have given me...\n\nBut Only One thing if they given tirupathi hub address and phone number in online it is also to find very easy.",
            "I am writing this review after using this for 3 months.\nPicture Quality is excellent. Sound quality is good for cable tv channels but seems decent for OTT platform.\nIf you really want to enjoy sound effects, I would suggest you to have audio system.\nAirPlay stops once in 10 times but this can be ignored.",
            "The TV is not the best out there. But it's the best for someone looking to buy a TV which isn't too expensive but still checks most of the boxes. Sound is good enough but not the best. Picture quality is good enough but not the best. WebOS is not the best but works. I use a firestick with this TV so I have absolutely nothing to do with the features or WebOS. It's exactly what I was looking for. 39k with exchange is a good deal for me.",
            "This is value for money TV, you are getting a trusted brand LG by paying 5000 to 8000 extra as compared to non premium brands. This is fair price high quality. If you want cheep price and fair quality then go for non premium brands.",
            "The best part about LG is the service.they didn't charge me for moving stand. Also i asked them for magic remote and they gave me the best deal 1072rs which i couldn't find anywhere else. The servic guys of LG are not there to make money out of u. My tv is working great without any issues all the apps r available.but one thing missing is a comman app like fire stick and jio set top box through a centralised system where u can see latest updates of all the apps in one place.",

            "This TV is very Good \ud83d\udc4d. Superb clarity, awesome sound quality. Apps are enough and no lagging. I haven't purchased smart remote, it's easy to control via LG App. Go for it.",
            "Excellent TV under this Price Range, Connectivity is great with excellent picture clarity & sound would have been more better but even this is good.\n\nPeople from Apple family can go for it without any thoughts as it supports Airplay and Home Kit, Can control it from Home Kit where ever you are.\n\nSiri supports only few commands Turn on & Off, if you are looking for voice control purchase magic remote which you wont get by default with TV, if you have andriod device install LG TV Plus app and thats it you can use google voice Assistant and no need of magic remote as this serves the entire functionality of magic remote.\n\nConnecting windows is also hassle free as it doesn\u2019t require any application or software to be installed in laptop, Directly you can use project and have your bluetooth in laptop turned on thats it.\n\nClarity of picture is great and sound would have been better but even this is good *This TV require HD channel subscriptions for sure as the normal picture mode is bad for this where the picture wont be clear and you see it blurred.\n\nInstallation promise was of 2 days but worst Flipkart installation took more than week till then the product was purchased only to place it inside box at corner of room.",
            "I have bought this tv in 21st installation done after 3 days after followup but overall flipkart done well from there end .Now comming to the feature this tv dosn,t come with magic remote but that is not concern for me since i have ECO dot Alexa device through which you can control all the basic task very easily .

Colors are vivid. Blacks are mostly food.\nSound is good too. I listen from a distance of 6 ft and I never have to use more than 40 of sound bar.\n\nOnly disadvantage is that only for HDR videoes, the out of focus black or any reflections in video are blurry/grainny.\nP.S.: NO MAGIC REMOTE IS BUNDLED WITH THIS VERSION.",
            "LG is a premium brand in tv. And manages to provide premium TV in great value which makes first choice while purchasing.

I brought this around 37000 along with two years of flipkart extended warranty.\nPros:\n1.Picture and sound quality.\n2.LG service.\n3.Web Os\nCons:\n1.

            "Missing lg magic remote.\nThough I haven't used android os, but I feel play store is much better than lg connect store.\nOther than above two, as a TV I liked it",
            "Got this TV delivered in two days as per the commitment from Flipkart. Installation was done after continuous followups with the service center.\n\nWe have both Samsung and LG, but LG picture quality is slightly better overall. I will recommend this tv. Service wise Samsung rocks!\n\nWe have connected Firestick 4k. It's a delite to watch 4k content on Netflix & Prime. The picture quality, colour and upscaling is handled well.\n\nWe got the fresh Stock 18th May 2021 Manufactured model.",
            "Its one of the best in the segment, lg lived upto its name, one of the best choice in the range, far better than the android tv's , picture quality is unmatchable, decent sound, AI makes your work easier.",
            "One of the best decision on a tv. Although many suggested other brands LG was on top of the list. And this made a lot of positive difference. If you have a large hall then this is a very good choice. Do not keep it in a small space because you cannot watch it end to end. And connectivity with iphones, ipad and android is seamless.",
            "Minimum Distance 8 feet is very good\nPitcher Good\nSound good\nSize good\nWall mounted normal\nI love it",

            "Overall good experiance with tv, but with my local set up box the picture quality is not good, but if i play something in youtube or some other application, it is giving very good experiance, if the tv has picture upscaling functionality ( like sony especially with local setup box) i could have given 5 star.",
            "Color is amazing\nSound quality is excellent\nNight mode ambitiant light settings works perfectly.\nUHD video quality is amazing, you need to have good internet for this.\nConnecting it with laptop or phone is piece of cake.\n\nUser friendly and recommended to order magic remote for extra ordinary experience",
            "There were initial issues on remote working. The installation team is not well versed with all functions & settings. The App store doesn't have all the Apps & Many apps not updated.\nApps not pre - installed : Sony LIV, Voot Select, MX player.\nThere're challenges in connecting with mobile ie casting, Using the external soundbar. I'm convinced that these aren't really the smart TVs. An external fire stick is still the best option. The service guys are more interested in selling extended warranty. Hope the TV shall last 3years.",
            "The picture quality of 4k and HD are too good. TV Build and Sound quality are so nice. Better to improve at LG content store to support chrome browser and Whatsapp apps.",

            "We have used this product for about a month and we are already regretting the purchase.\n1. The remote stops working at random. I have changed the batteries a few times already and it has a mood of its own, and would only work when it likes.\n2. It does not \"cast\" everything. The only app it works with is YouTube. Even though it can \"screen cast\" from some phones, it does not do it from individual apps, for example, Prime Video, Netflix, Hotstar, etc.\n3. The sound is poor. You can't hear anything. We probably will end up buying a soundbar.\n4. Even this early in its life, the WiFi connection is poor. While all the devices at home remain connected, it fails to connect often. We had an LG TV abroad, and it had the same issue. That was 4 years ago and I thought they would have fixed after all this upgrade iterations.\n5. The only plus is its picture quality. It is immaculate, and 4K videos are a spectacle. But it will be like watching a silent movie as you won't hear a thing.",
            "Its just a smart tv not an android tv ,, you couldn't find playstore in it like in other Android tvs ,, we couldn't find MX player Tv in it and we also face lot of problems while casting phone ,, and if you connect your brother's google id and phone to tv then you wouldn't cast your phone or other phone to cast your YouTube video in it ,, its just web os ,, Pure Android tv have much better features . ,, Pocture quality is good",
            "The product is no doubt the best value for money. 55 inch Ips screen from renowned brand like lg at this price point is unbelievable. But beware of this seller \"Ramthralla\". Got a damaged product at first . Then I did some digging online and found out I am not the first. Anyway kudos to flipkart for helping me through the replacement process..",
            "Well, the delivery and installation were done as promised by flipkart. The installation team came on their own after confirmation. After having surveyed all lead brands like sony, samsung, lg and also new entrants like Kodak, Panasonic etc, I settled for LG. The budget guys always did have that one odd doubt after reading reviews.\nMost parts to Sony is supplied by LG, so why sony!!\nWriting this after ine month of use.\nPicture n sound quality is superb. Though I have a decent home theatre connected, the built in sound system is so good that at times for Netflix and all Undo not need my home theatre.\nGood Buy!!",
            "After 1 month usage.\n-Picture quality was top notch with excellent viewing experiance.4k content was good.\n-Sound is ok.No need of sound bar if it is placed in <13 feet hall.\n-Connectivity was good.\n-Installation was done by lg(free).\n-Built quality was ok\n-Storage was less.but we can connect and play by plugging pendrive etc.\n-Net connectivity was good\n-Casting mobile was good with minure lags which cannot effect our viewing experiece.\n-Webos was fine and receives updates regularly.as i got 3 updates till now.\n-I got trouble with Flipkart service where i recieved a defective piece and it took a week above to receive the new product only after calling to flipkart customer care twice/thrice a day.Flipkart need to reform replacement policy.\nFINAL verdict- Product and lg service was good(flipkart service-brutal i can say).Its a good choice to buy because compared to other brands picture quality,service was good.its good choice to go for this variant instead of higher prices at offline market.\n-But have to see how long it works well without any repair.\n-i got this for 33k.",
            "Amazing TV in the price range. Picture quality and sound is amazing for my bedroom. Fast connectivity and all important apps are available.

            "You can't download apps like MXPlayer or any android supported apps because this TV works on LG WebOs. It's not at all user friendly and too complicated to operate. I deleted Disney+hotstar accidently and just unable to reinstall it again. The virtual dtx sound is just a farce. There's literally no bass when it's on virtual dtx and Cinema mode sounds much better. Overall, the picture quality is excellent but this TV isn't really that smart if you are looking to download new apps.",
            "LG is superb brand with awesome quality products. I have air-conditioner amd now tv. It was looking fantastic. I have sony bravia hd ready tv now for my second tv i switched to Lg, it is value for money product.. service man who came for installation was also well behaved.",
            "Very Fast delivery in just 3 days and delivered in afternoon and called the LG customer care and asked to register for installation and installation done on same day . Everything looks good even 8k video on youtube play smoothly and wifi connectivity is very good. You can use magic remote app on mobile because if you think to buy, it would cost 3000 extra. Wall mount provided free and will be brought by installation person. Overall display is best just the cricket mode looks little bit more contrast so I would suggest to use standard mode for display, Audio is best and can be used accordingly for movie, cricket and music mode. I would suggest to go for it because I searched in all showrooms and compared the brightness in nits and actually how they look MI Tv though cheap but display is very poor when I watch these side by side. Its the best go for it.",

I purchased the TV while the country was still under lockdown. I could hardly go to any shops to check out the product but one thing I learnt was that electronics are more expensive in the store than online. For the same price I was only getting a 49 inch TV from LG Or Samsung. So I decided to order the 55 inch model. The delivery was made in 2 days and the wall mount of the TV was done within a day of delivery. Time for installation and delivery could vary depending on your location. Now, coming to the product itself I can say without a doubt that im more than happy with the product. Picture quality is absolutely stunning. You get a swivel wall mount with which you can move the tv forward or backwards after fixing it on the wall. This is my 3rd lg tv and I've no complaints as of now.",

Even with HD DTH, the sharpness in pictures is still missing. In case of OTT apps, the quality is good if the video is played in highest quality. Bezels are sleeker than its 32\" version.

Not a big deal though.\nSome dark scenes are little too dark\nNo aux port for old speaker systems\n\nVerdict\nI can strongly recommend this. Three years lg comprehensive warranty gives you a piece of mind.\n\nInstallation people delayed things. But once I escalated the same to LG.. things were done swiftly.

I could never extract atmos sound effect until started using this TV. 4K Firestick, when connecting to TV or soundbar has given me only 5.1 effects. But using the TV\u2019s Netflix app I was able to get the Atmos effect.SO yes, u can get Dolby Atmos pass-through from this TV using HDMI arc to an Atmos content Supported Soundbar/AV receiver which can decode Atmos content.\n\u2022 Bluetooth works fine, casting works fine\n\n\nCons:\n\n\u2022 There are some times where we get a feeling that video quality is lacking\n\u2022 Picture quality- we can select many picture modes like vivid, standard, etc. but I see that apart from vivid and standard all other modes adds a strong yellow color to the screen.",

I had some issues with casting using mobile but then I observed that once you restart the mobile casting works fine. Web OS is better than Android when it comes to ease of use and response lag time but has fewer apps. If you are looking for a large no of apps then this TV isn't for you. There is a clear difference when you are using webos apps. The video quality in web os apps is much more clear than casting or using cable. Sony Liv app works fine on this tv. Viewing angles are great. Sound is fine if you are not a music buff or using it in a small room. Base is low. We are using it in a 10*12 room. I feel that there is no need for a magic remote as the lg thinQ app works great. There might be minor issues here and there, for eg., one or two times the lg thinQ app stopped responding but most of the time I had no issues. I would like to add that this is my first led tv. My only previous experience with led screens was with a Dell monitor bought in 2017 and laptops. So please take this review with a pinch of salt. And would like to applaud the LG team for prompt installation. The Flipkart delivery guy did a good job too. Thank you LG and Flipkart for a glitch free experience.",

But with custom mode all the parameters of picture quality like back lighting, brightness,contrast ,sharpness, colour can be adjusted as per viewers individual preferences for viewing different genre of channels.\nSound is ok,but usually the built-in speakers are no match to ext speaker systems,sound bar with subwoofers etc.\nI have attached one soundbar with subwoofer ,the sound output is fantastic specially when viewing movies,netflix,hotstar etc.\nConnecticity with wi fi internet is easy and user friendly.\nRemote control is also user friendly.\nThe installation experience is great.Wall mount , brought by the Lg aurhorised service technician is strudy with swivel,for tilting the tv,if required.\nThe installation was done on the next day i received the tv,two days ahead of the sceduled installation date.\nMy overall experience of buying the product and the subsequent installation through flipkart has been 5star.",

            "Nice",
            "Firstly, on the logistical part- The product got delivered in one day and the installation happened on the very next day. Happy for that and also the technician from LG is professional and had the patience to listen to my requirements and Demo also went well. 100% happy on delivery and installation.\n\nComing to the TV spec- My initial choice was to go with budgeted TV in 4k- I almost bumped to purchase MI 4k TV or Motorola during the Dasara sale. But after thorough research, I decided to go with a branded one.\n\nThe product is very good and the 4k video plays very smoothly with precision.\n\nAs many people said, yes the magic remote doesn't come with this product but however, the TV does support it and I have downloaded the App. or you can buy for around 900Rs.\n\nThe product came with 3 years warranty (1+2) and on top, I took an additional 2 years warranty from LG for 3K which makes 5 years hassle-free experience.\n\nMy rating-\n\nVideo 4.5/5 ( considering the price) . Yes, Even the latest LG which priced around 45-50K also use the same panel.\nSound - 4/5 it comes with 20 watts and I think is more than enough.\nWarranty - 5/5 ( a few extra amount on AMC makes life easy )\nOS- 4/5 this is the only thing that might be a con. there are quite a few apps that are not available right now ( like MX player etc).\n\nPros:\n\nVideo clarity ( Pls don't compare with Sony or any QLED) but in the 40k segment, I think this is the best in the market.\nLG brand\nPost-service\nMagic remote ( easy to play around)\n\nCons:\nDoesn't come with a magic remote. Need to buy separately\nWeb OS ( not exactly a big con but few apps are missing)\n\nOverall- If your budget permits and wants a true decent 4K experience then one can go with this TV",

So I decided to check in all available online supplies and I chose flipkart. After all the delivery was made within the provided time the only problem I faced was that the product was not deliverable in my pincode so I choose my nearest pincode and I thought they will deliver me to my home because the product is little expensive but poorly they didn't thay asked me to go to that place which was around 14km away and it was heavily raining. I have real complaint on that by the side of flipkart they should have done much more better but anyway I picked up the tv and brought home. I installed it by myself in a table for checking and I found it was working and I would say the TV goes for a 5 star. It is awesome guys. And the installation guy came after 5 days also because of their problems. They told the installation will be done within 48hrs of delivery was a bullshit actually in my case. Anyway thank you flipkart you guys have to improve a lot on the delivery. \u263a\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",
