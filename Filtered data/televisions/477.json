            "This is a detailed review after 7 days. Please read this if you have problem or concern regarding sound/picture/brightness/sd channels/wifi connectivity/miracast.\nPICTURE: the picture quality is really amazing. Blacks are really deep. Contrast is pretty good too. No complaints there.\n\nBRIGHTNESS: tv is pretty bright, by default dynamic light is on and it will make your screen dull, just turn it off. I've set it to 25. No screen galre problem.\n\nSOUND: tv speakers doesn't have much bass, ideal For a small room. For larger rooms or halls, hometheatre is recommended. Also by default sound output is extremely low, you have to manually adjust equalizer. And still the sound would be low for streaming apps, for set-top box sound is good and loud too.\n\nSD CHANNEL: the SD channels looks amazing, the upscaling of this tv is mind-blowing. No complaints there, but you have to use Hdmi cable, normal av-cable quality looks poor. Also don't connect older set top box hdmi 1,coz its hdmi(arc), you will encounter sound issues.\n\nWIFI: I had a lot of problem wile using wifi, but a very simple solution was to turnoff data saver. Then wifi worked like a charm. This is bad if you plan to use your mobile hotspot.\nThe wifi range is pretty good too. My router and tv are 40ft. Apart and it still works without buffering. Also, there are about 3 walls between router and tv.\n\nMIRACAST: it's gonna hang if you'll use mobile hotspot to cast to tv. I used one plus 6t hotspot and it lagged. If you have a router installed, then use that network, I didn't feel any problem using home network. Although there was minor lag which is acceptable.\n\nHope these solutions help.\n\nNow some openions:\n\nI played 4k60fps video from pendrive and it played without any problem. No lag or buffer was noticed.\n\nI used jio cinema and jio tv app without any problem, but jio tv is not recommended, as the streamed quality of sd channels is extremely poor.\n\nThe bluetooth remote has a pretty good range too, I've used it as far as 30fts.\n\nIt takes around 1 min. For this tv To boot up. It's just annoying to wait this long.\n\nYou have to manually press switch on button on remote too every time you turn on tv from switch. That's just annoying.\n\nBy default, youtube playes 720p videos, you have to manually set to 1080p every time. That's just annoying.\n\nThat's it for now. I'll edit it if I find new findings. Hope this helps.",
            "I m posting review after checking all it's functionalities and settings in 40inch version. Below are the summary points :\n* Display : looks decent. 4k and full HD content looks satisfying. casted content dispaly quality is below par (also depends on the content you are casting).\nbezels are thin and are made of plastic which is loosely attached to the display panel. viewing angles are good covers around 150\u00b0\n* Connectivity: impressive , connects to WiFi, Bluetooth , Chromecast smoothly. observed some glitches with Chromecast when the screen just froze on the tv while the content was changing on my mobile.\n* Patchwall : provides good interface and helps choose from good variety of content available.\n* Sound : is impressive and feels quite smooth even at higher volumes due to dts hd technology, though dolby sound could have made it better.\nNetflix, hotstar , Amazon prime etc : it plays smoothly and provides immersive experience.\n* Installation: installation was prompt, I received tv on Thursday and installation was done by Sat. installation guy was knowledgeable but tried to sell stabilizer at a higher price to me, I declined the offer to which the person said the tv can get faulty if you don't use stabilizer, I could not find any such condition in the product detail so I denied using it.\n\nTo sum it up it is above average TV at this price loaded with the benefits of Android with decent picture quality.\n*Area of improvent would be in contrast ratio and color reproduction.\nif you liked the review do hit the like button.\nThanks.\nEdit 1 : Thanks for 1k upvotes. Adding some more points after completing 1 month usage:\n* Netflix ultra HD content gives you really good viewing experience.\n* Remote is very handy, but difficult to type something when you want to search anything on tv since it does not have alphabet and number buttons. but you can make use of Google assistant here by directly speaking your requirement in the remote and it works buttery smooth.",

            "Bought this model in Jan 2020 ... So my review would be for the latest model you will be receiving , hope it will help you ...\n\nSo Firstly , out of the box i got the remote with Prime Video and Netflix button ... the product description on Flipkart does not mention Netflix and Prime Video support , but after the update it does and Mi is providing with the latest accessories . ( 5/5 )\n\nSecondly , i read a lot of review about Chromecast not working .. But my Chromecast works fine . There is a bit lag though due to my internet connection , my connection is 10Mbps and i stream HD quality videos on YouTube , Prime Videos without any lag . (4/5)\n\nThirdly , display is ok and sound is good but i cannot complain about those because at this price range it is a steal . ( 4/5 )\n\nI was going for samsung initially but i ended up getting this one due to the price and Android TV . Samsung's Tizen OS is optimized and fast but you can do a lot more in an android device and the number of apps is high due to the play support .\n\nSo i give this product a 5/5 rating just because the value you are getting at this price point .\n\nI can totally recommend this to anyone and it does have Netflix and Prime videos so don't be skeptical.\n\nHope this helped",
            "I love this MI tv good quality with affordable price. it supports 4k video also especially dolby audio is too good\nsuggestions : MI should give the wall hanging stand for free of cost",
            "Good product . Best value for money Android smart tv\nTimely delivery & proper installation done on schedule date . Thanks to FLIPKART .",

Also don't connect older set top box hdmi 1,coz its hdmi(arc), you will encounter sound issues.\n\nWIFI: I had a lot of problem wile using wifi, but a very simple solution was to turnoff data saver. Then wifi worked like a charm. This is bad if you plan to use your mobile hotspot.\nThe wifi range is pretty good too. My router and tv are 40ft. Apart and it still works without buffering. Also, there are about 3 walls between router and tv.\n\nMIRACAST: it's gonna hang if you'll use mobile hotspot to cast to tv. I used one plus 6t hotspot and it lagged. If you have a router installed, then use that network, I didn't feel any problem using home network. Although there was minor lag which is acceptable.\n\nHope these solutions help.\n\nNow some openions:\n\nI played 4k60fps video from pendrive and it played without any problem. No lag or buffer was noticed.\n\nI used jio cinema and jio tv app without any problem, but jio tv is not recommended, as the streamed quality of sd channels is extremely poor.\n\nThe bluetooth remote has a pretty good range too, I've used it as far as 30fts.\n\nIt takes around 1 min. For this tv To boot up. It's just annoying to wait this long.\n\nYou have to manually press switch on button on remote too every time you turn on tv from switch. That's just annoying.\n\nBy default, youtube playes 720p videos, you have to manually set to 1080p every time. That's just annoying.\n\nThat's it for now. I'll edit it if I find new findings. Hope this helps.",
            "I m posting review after checking all it's functionalities and settings in 40inch version. Below are the summary points :\n* Display : looks decent. 4k and full HD content looks satisfying. casted content dispaly quality is below par (also depends on the content you are casting).\nbezels are thin and are made of plastic which is loosely attached to the display panel. viewing angles are good covers around 150\u00b0\n* Connectivity: impressive , connects to WiFi, Bluetooth , Chromecast smoothly. observed some glitches with Chromecast when the screen just froze on the tv while the content was changing on my mobile.\n* Patchwall : provides good interface and helps choose from good variety of content available.\n* Sound : is impressive and feels quite smooth even at higher volumes due to dts hd technology, though dolby sound could have made it better.\nNetflix, hotstar , Amazon prime etc : it plays smoothly and provides immersive experience.\n* Installation: installation was prompt, I received tv on Thursday and installation was done by Sat. installation guy was knowledgeable but tried to sell stabilizer at a higher price to me, I declined the offer to which the person said the tv can get faulty if you don't use stabilizer, I could not find any such condition in the product detail so I denied using it.\n\nTo sum it up it is above average TV at this price loaded with the benefits of Android with decent picture quality.\n*Area of improvent would be in contrast ratio and color reproduction.\nif you liked the review do hit the like button.\nThanks.\nEdit 1 : Thanks for 1k upvotes. Adding some more points after completing 1 month usage:\n* Netflix ultra HD content gives you really good viewing experience.\n* Remote is very handy, but difficult to type something when you want to search anything on tv since it does not have alphabet and number buttons. but you can make use of Google assistant here by directly speaking your requirement in the remote and it works buttery smooth.",

            "Bought this model in Jan 2020 ... So my review would be for the latest model you will be receiving , hope it will help you ...\n\nSo Firstly , out of the box i got the remote with Prime Video and Netflix button ... the product description on Flipkart does not mention Netflix and Prime Video support , but after the update it does and Mi is providing with the latest accessories . ( 5/5 )\n\nSecondly , i read a lot of review about Chromecast not working .. But my Chromecast works fine . There is a bit lag though due to my internet connection , my connection is 10Mbps and i stream HD quality videos on YouTube , Prime Videos without any lag . (4/5)\n\nThirdly , display is ok and sound is good but i cannot complain about those because at this price range it is a steal . ( 4/5 )\n\nI was going for samsung initially but i ended up getting this one due to the price and Android TV . Samsung's Tizen OS is optimized and fast but you can do a lot more in an android device and the number of apps is high due to the play support .\n\nSo i give this product a 5/5 rating just because the value you are getting at this price point .\n\nI can totally recommend this to anyone and it does have Netflix and Prime videos so don't be skeptical.\n\nHope this helped",

            "it very nice mi tv good condition valuable for money but installation tv to late jeeves. pictures quality good .sounds effectively nice. can the the mi tv in flipkart it great delvery it on time it amazing",
            "Pros:\n1. Good Price\n2. Good Clarity\n3. Light Weight\n4. Sufficient loud Sound. Though for good theater experience you will have to buy external speakers of your choice.\n5. Fast delivery and installation.\n\nCons:\n1. TV legs are of cheap quality, non-durable and risk to use. The TV might fall from it very easily.\n2. TV remove is very basic. No QWERT keyboard. I guess for Smart TV people will browse and type hence the Mi remote doesn't serve purpose. moreover it should be an air remote else frustrating to browse/type with it. You will have to buy an QWERT air mouse which means another 1200 to 2000 expense.\n3. No Wall mount provided with TV. The Mi brand wall mount which Flipkart service engineer brings costs Rs.500 but it is not of good quality nor its adjustable (i.e. doesn't go front, back, left right etc). Hence you will have to buy a wall mount of good quality which will come for Rs. 1350 and above for 43 inches TV. The service engineer also brings a third party wall mount but doesn't give bill for it. Hence they might be overpricing and selling it to customer. Flipkart must keep a check on this.\n4. Ram of 1 GB is not sufficient. I guess it should be 2 GB at least for a Smart TV else software goes slow when you install apps.\n5. Internal memory of 8GB is not sufficient because only 3GB is left over for installing apps . 7 GB is occupied by Andorid OS it self. Hence company should be fair enough to tell its only 3 GB internal memory rather than saying 8GB. Once you start installing apps the TV becomes low in space tend to operate very slow.\n6. No support for popular apps like prime and netflix.\n7. You need really strong wifi connection to watch 1080px stuff online on this TV e.g. Prime installed through 3d party side doesn't play videos at all if there is low wifi connection.",
            "It's really a vey very very excellent product at this price range. The patchwall, android interface are very handy to use. Even the wifi connectivity, USB plug in, apps installation is fast. The remote of this TV is the most cutest thing you might see. Only 12 buttons and pretty handy to use. The google voice is also very accurate to detect you words.\n\nOnly the stands are a bit shaky only if u want to have the TV on a table or standing position. On wall it is very firm.\n\nThe packing and delivery was good and we got the demo service on the very next day so no issues regarding seller.",
            "picture quality is superb. Android smart TV in this price segment is unbelievable. Flipkart service is average but the installation is too late. But this is my best TV. I like it.

            "I wish to know if all those who buy this TV from Flipkart, how good and quick installation service was available from the supporting technical team after delivery? The product was delivered on 8th feb and I was informed about installation on 9th feb. Surprisingly, i never got any information and just waited till evening. then I wrote to them and have been a chain mail of sorry and taking actions since then. I wonder, because even after raising the issue since 7-8 days for 1 whole week, Flipkart customer care calls to check whether the installation was done, service provider asks the same question, 'when they can come' and take a time, make you wit at home and never come, call or inform. Again the same routine next day, flipkart office calls to know, then to apologize, then to ask for the last 24 hrs and again note being able to solve it. This is really the routine I have lived with this whole week. I had also paid for 2 years extended warranty, but now, it seems that money might be going to flipkart for free because they have no control on providing a professional service of a simple installation, how would they ever provide warranty related service. If they ever need to sustain in large appliance sale, they need professional service partners, nor unprofessional morons who break their own promise not one but multiple times to make the customer suffer. I have a sincere suggestion to all those fellow customers buying r planning to buy big appliances, be very careful about the service response promptness available in your area as I am not staying in a remote location, I am staying in a metro set-up, capital of a large state. To make it feel worst, i am also the plus member and a very old customer, may be 8-9 years. Please be careful",

            "After buying this for 21500 i saw reviews on youtube about it an came across video where they said installation time was huge after getting the T.V also you cant open it as it voids warranty, which made me think twice on the purchase made, but Flipkart lived up to the expectation the TV was delivered in morning and installed by afternoon same day \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude42\n\nCons: TV doesn't have Amazon Prime video or Netflix's or Jio cinema ( possibly you can side load them not tried that yet)\nBrightness is weired, even with dynamic brightness off Cable TV looks darker(could be cause i am using AV input)\nWifi reception is not strong enough\nAbsence of mute button on factory remote",

            "The tv is good but the installation is not good..\nJeeves will not respond and they will reschedule the installation date for next day daily... And they will come on our convenient day. If you book the mi tv then you can able to contact the mi for installation of your TV they will respond within 6 hours.",
            "Value for money.\nPicture- I played some videos from YouTube, picture quality is good. Still need to check for dth as I don't have hd set top box.\nSound- Speakers are really impressive.\nConnectivity- Enough options available so no issue with that, I tried chromecast, hdmi, 3.5mm jack and all is working fine. Only issue is that after wall mounting avi ports are almost impossible to reach, hdmi ports are still ok to reach.\nDelivery and installation- Delivered in 2 days so happy with the Flipkart delivery. Installation took 3 days and also the service provided by jeeves was not good. I had to call the technician number of times and also when he arrived he was in a hurry and didn't explain all the functionality.\nTo summarise my review, overall it is a value for money product.",

The TV is android but application installed from unknown source not working properly i.e Google Chrome, What's App, Netflix, Amazon prime, etc.\n5.wall Mount may be included in TV box, because installation process be lated due to non availability of it.\nPositive points\n1. Bluetooth feature is Amazing. you can enjoy everything without disturbing anyone though Bluetooth headphones.\n2. Voice search is amazing which reduces your time to find anything rather than type.\n3. picture quality is very good.",

            "Being a smart TV, this is basically an Android device with a large screen and a remote for controlling. One can perform any action on this TV that one could do on an Android device, except calling, of course. This TV has all the features of a conventional TV set and much more. The TV can be connected to the internet via Wi-Fi or an Ethernet cable to access and view anything on the web. There are 3 HDMI ports that can be used to connect a computer and then this devics acts as a large computer monitor. Two USB ports that comes with it ensures that media can be played from USB storage devices. There is the option to connect conventional RCA cables and a coaxial cable. About 4.7 GB of internal storage space is available in the device that can be used to store files as in a regular Android device. The display quality (HD) is good for a device of this price range and this display size. The remote control that comes with it is a smart remote control that has inbuilt Bluetooth connectivity and acts as a conventional remote plus a microphone for giving audio inputs to the TV. There is an option to play screen savers on the screen when it is idle, which is cool. The speakers are of good quality. It can surely satisfy the TV needs of a typical Indian household.",

Also during installation the guy told me that wall mounting would cost extra 500/- which was fine but i suggested I'll wait for few days see if the tv looks good on stand or wall mount is better. He said if you call me after 2 days the cost of wall mount will be 800 which felt wrong to me because it's the same wall mount. The amount of work is same too",

Jiotv and airteltv are not streamable however. Had issues with sound quality. Suddenly increases or decreases, which you need to setup manually to see which is the best. Also internet connectivity using ethernet or wifi suddenly disconnects.",

Recommended to buy instead wasting in other brands ......",
            "Picture Quality is good. Sound is loud enough but not theater like or dolby digital sound like. The tv has wifi connectivity is issue that is really irritating so we got a wifi extender and pluged it just near the tv and now the tv is able to stream 4k videos with any problem. It has system update available which will provide official support for Netflix and Prime videos and will upgrade the os to android pie, so update it as soon as possible. The engineering who came from jeevas for wall mount installation was quite naive and caused a lot of headache. But if we talk about the experience with it is quite great and value of money. Just get a stronger router or an extender if wifi connectivity issue occurs.",

Doesn't play the sound properly with my philips home theatre. (Fyi: The home theatre plays well with laptop and mobile phone but both only one speaker works when connected to smart TV.) Some software bug is there which needs to be rectified by Xiaomi. Also doesn't mirror cast with my mobile phone (Note 5 pro)",

Earlier i used 32inch Mi 4A and could see lots of difference from that.\nDisplay is bright and clear.\nAudio wise the sound is clear but the maximum sound itself is not that loud.

Screen become slow to response and lots of apps not available in playstore which requires in smart TV.But connecting to Prime and Netflix is fast and internet connectivity is good.\nWorth for the buck in this price range.",
            "Rating: 3.5/5\n\nPros\n1. High value for money. You absolutely cannot get this screen size, image quality, Android TV and Netflix+ Prime in built from any other brand.\n2. Android TV is great, the app options are good and increasing.\n\nCons\n1. If you connect Bluetooth speakers, Netflix would run with distorted audio and Prime would show an error whenever you try to play any content.\n2. Audio is quite inconsistent and I find myself maxing out the volume because the treble is really low sometimes, without adding any bass.\n3. The processor is pretty slow, which means around a full minute for the Home screen to load.\n4. Pretty small detail but they should mention in the description that batteries are not provided with the remote. Not everyone would have a couple of AAA size ones lying around. Although I understand that is a safety measure to prevent any heat related explosion during transport.\n5. Android TV App, while makes life easier by replacing the TV remote, cannot start/turn off the TV. And the biggest advantage i.e. a touch keyboard, doesn't work with Youtube/Netflix/Prime.",

If you view the monitor from a distance of 6ft +, you will get to see the colours at full sharpness. I am a normal user without much tech background. I do not find any abnormality in my experience.

            "Best good awesome for small family. Chiz badi achi hai... I like it.,,\nI bought it on 5 feb 2020.",
            "I have been using this Tv for a couple of months now and I'm quite satisfied with the performance. As such i haven't had any problems. The picture quality is good and you can set the picture based on your preference by going into their advance settings, mostly watching online tv shows which requires the internet connectivity they have provided the RJ45 port to connect your LAN cable or you use the WiFi which is an initial setup when you boot up the TV for the first time. The sound quality is quite clear, the TV also gives you the provision of attaching external speakers via the 3.5mm audio out port or you can simply connect your bluetooth speaks and listen to the audio. Being an Android OS tv the Play Store has the usual applications which are made for the TV and receive updates quite often, initial updates are huge for the OS. The TV has the provision of casting your phone via Chormecast which is inbuilt. The remote being simplistic is the best thing a small and light weight remote which connects via bluetooth too, pairing the remote is quite easy. Make sure you keep the user manual and don't lose it or give it away while the installation.\n\nThe wall mounts are an additional cost which the installer offers.\n\nTo summarise, it's a TV you will really be satisfied buying.",
            "Received this Mi LED Smart TV 4A Pro (43) in good condition and installation was done perfectly.\nGot the update (Android 9) after installation is completed and reviewed all the features one by one.\nAfter few days, tried using the (Timer Functionality & Screen OFF) mode, while playing MP3 and watching YouTube videos and later observed that POWER button in Remote got Disabled and used Google Assistant to Turn OFF the TV.\nAfter this I got little bit confused and tried Google search for Troubleshooting, later did a Factory Reset. After this it came to normal mode again, but again tried the same testing again and faced the same issue again.\nLater I escalated this issue to Mi Support and they arranged for Motherboard Replacement to resolve this issue. But after replacing the Motherboard did the same Testing and faced the same issue again.\nLater came to conclusion that this is a Software BUG and not an Hardware issue.\nMi Support team agreed that this is related to Software BUG and they have escalated to Mi R&D team and expected to get this BUG fix later by end of December 2019 software update.\nLater Mi Support team have promised to replace this existing TV with New TV and today (04.Dec.2019) support person is coming to replace the new motherboard with original old motherboard and will be getting the replacement new TV by this week.\nI will update once replacement new TV is received from Mi Team (Date of Purchase, Oct'2019).",
            "nice budget led in 40 inch full hd and full of functions good sound good picture quality. go for it you will not regret",
            "TV is good, Clarity is at par with Sony. overall good product\nI am not happy with remote control. Power off and voice assist buttons are placed so close often both get pressed simultaneously. There is no Mute button on the remote.",
            "excellent led\nmi is tha best brand for led TVs\nthanks you flipkart",
            "Nice led tv. Initially when we seeing the quality of picture is not find so good little light shade is there but after one update it brings to good. and also if Hd cable set up box is there than it will further improve, we bought it for around 15000 with exchange of old tv. overall good deal and good tv.",
            "really something wonderful happened...\nfully smart LED\nyoutube , netflix , hotstar, Sony liv , voot\nall avilable...\nmirror casting is very smooth after i updated the device ....\nsame day installation as on delivery..\nbest experience with flipcart",
            "The TV is good. picture quality is good for the price. super connectivity. Prime video works after andriod 9.0 update. Good TV for the budget price. Thanks to flipkart. The installation service also good.",
            "I was like in doubt how the mi will perform... but after buying this I was totally satisfied... got it installed by Jeeves on the same day of delivery and also got the update to PIE after 2 days of installation... very fast update.. also coming to brightness issues.. if you turn off the dynamic backlight then you will not have any kind of brightness issue...totally satisfied with the product.. totally recommend it...",
            "Brilliant TV in 18k. Picture quality is great. It just don't have enough brightness. The sound is loud enough. I noticed these cons- low brightness, connection keeps dropping off from screen cast, Bluetooth connection also drops sometime, 1gb ram is slight less. Doesn't seem something that can be used excessively. Pros- best in price, beautiful picture quality,works above expectations if used lightly. My piece of advice - Go for it if you want a budget smart TV.",
            "Well, first of all I will recommend everyone to buy this TV and the reason behind this is its quality, and other features in very low amount. I got this TV in 22,000 Rs. under offer. It has been 4 months using this TV and I didn't find any problem in this TV. Its sound quality is amazing and if you want something more in sound era then you can buy MI sound bar for only 5000 which will give a new boost to your TV. Talking about its PROS: Display is too good and there is not any problem of brightness and such other screen issues. You will get Patchwall in it and with the help of that you can watch anything just on your TV but remember you have to pay for OTT apps in Patchwall but my advice is that you should watch all of them for free and if you want to know how you can watch free TV and episodes, movies, etc, then goto my YouTube Channel MR SHIVARTH, i have uploaded there a video, also I have shown you all the TV things in another video of my channel. Chromecast is inbuilt in this so you will be able to share your smartphone screen on your TV and you will also have Google Assistant support in it and you can avail this with the help of a remote where there are few buttons to operate TV and remember you will not get battery in it. Another thing to remember is to not open box by yourself because if product has somewhere dent or damaged you will not be able to replace that and also your warranty will not be claimed by you and becomea void. So its better to get your TV box opened by service technician. The technician will come from Jeeves and on the same day of delivery or next day you will get your TV installed in your room. You need to pay 500 for wall mount if you want your TV to hang on wall and if you want to place it on Table then you don't need to pay any extra money to Technician. You will get Android Oreo in the TV but in future you will be able to see Android Pie support in MI 43 inch Pro TV. After this you get many types of ports in the TV like HDMI, USB, etc., and 43 inch is not that big as well as not that small so you can definitely go for it. Hoping, this review will help you and finally you will never get any issue in claiming warranty.",
            "super clarity, sound quality also very good and high sound. I really really love it. thank for flipkart. worth for money.",

            "Good quality",
            "Updated after 1.5 month:\n1. Netflix/Prime Video are officially supported.\n2. Chromescast is just a pain to connect (restart mobile/TV). It may frustrate you for 1+ Hrs.\n3. Android Pie 9 update: Slowere OS load on first boot\n\nOld:\nFirst of all, I really don't understand what's the purpose of this TV when there are just limited sets of apps on Android Play Store.\n\nDisclaimer: Pics are not uploaded as it failed.\n\nI wanted to go for just Smart TV but thought of evolving and updates from MI and Android. Fingers crossed.\n\nComing to review:\nPros:\n- Best in class picture quality from front. It's minor fade from side angles. (Videocon D2H HD works awesome). Even SD channels are good.\n- Sound is not the best but not disappointing at all. It's HD feel of sound due to speakers. Good job there.\n- I had no issues with Connectivity to be precise. It's just flawless. (Still on Mobile tethering)\n- Screen is big as I have 43'. Add this to your hall.\n- Casting your android device to TV is easy, thanks to Chromescast and one touch. (Install Google Home in your mobile?\n\nCons:\n- Pathwall is just a garbage which most of us will never open. It has OTT apps but all paid.\n- No Netflix, Prime, Airtel, Vodafone TV apps along with many. A big disappointment from MI and Google Android TV app Store.\n- Remote is just to use when you need it. A button press changes your screen. Be careful.\n- Doesn't come with Wall Mount. Have to spend extra for same.\n- Android eats up your space for nothing. Manageable but should be more as the apps and services are not enough from Android.",

            "Myself am very satisfied with this product. The sound and picture quality are too good, without Hd channels also it is looking like Hd clarity, screen mirroring is the only lagging issue in android it requires 2 smart phones to operate.. i.e., In another mobile we have to make it hotspot ON and in our mobile we have to operate with Wi-Fi .you will get all benefits in this MI TV as like as other brands but i will give only 4 rating because of that screen mirroring is not at all working properly atleast once. I had very disappointed in this particular option. if incase it works, I don't hesitate to give 5 stars.\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",

At this price range this the best deal that you will get and trust me you will not be dissapointed at all. The colors on the TV are good, It comes pre installed with Hotstar , You Tube and other apps. Patchwall from MI is excellent. You can also install many other Android TV apps like the Prime Video, Firefox , show box etc and it runs smoothly without any problem at all. The only con that i found was that the MI TV does not support Netflix yet but this restriction is more from Netflix side as there are certain parameters which MI is working upon. Overall , a great buy . Go for it without any doubt. !!!!",

I bought a flexi mount stand for rs 400 in market.\nThe installation is free of cost.\nAlso the MI remote does not come with batteries so you have to buy batteries for the same.\nIf you find brightness to be on lower side them then go in the setting menu then in pictures option swith off adaptive brightness, Viola brightness is increased.",

            "This MI branded TV is absolutely average. I bought it over other comparable brands like TCL or Toshiba trusting them MI brand and service Center network.\n\n1.The remote control has Spartan controls so it is very difficult to navigate through available features and basic input options.\n\n2. The picture quality is below average with poor brightness even at maximum setting\n\n3. Sound fidelity is inferior to other comparable TV brand and one needs to crank up the volume for better audio. That causes corresponding increase in noise\n\nBuying this TV seems like a poor decision on hindsight considering that the product cannot be returned unless there is a manufacturing defect.",

And Google assistant is not working, very worst experience, I brought it manily for Google assistant, so that everyone in my family can operate it by voice , even my grandma. So it disappoints a lot.\nPicture quality I good so far, sound is also same from beginning but sound seems to be not that clear.\nDon't buy this product , look for other better tv",

            "After using it for 2 weeks, No issues. Best features at the price provided. Wall mount stand is not provided which is not good. Installation guys/external service providers charge 500-600 for the stand which is not worth 50rs. This charge covers for more than the installation charges and customer is fooled with the so called \"free installation\". The service provider \"Jeeve's also used cheap tactics to sell their other products like stabilizer. The guy was like threatening me that if I don't buy and install stabilizer then we might not be able to cover ur TV for the additional 3 year warranty which I bought at additional 1200. I would recommend ppl not to go for additional warranty and it's not going to help out. It's time Flipkart/MI (not sure of agreements with respect to installation) checks on this and have a reliable and honest installation provider.",
            "I am writing this review after 3 weeks of usage. The picture and sound quality are good. Connectivity is also decent. The best feature is data saver as most small towns and villages in India are far from reach of high speed broadband. So you can easily connect to your mobile hotspot without consuming data too much provided the picture quality is not set to very high quality.\n\nInitially I faced some issue with the mirror cast using Google home app. It may work one or two times but then it will start hanging, only shows volume up and down on TV screen. After lots of reasearch, I found Castto screen mirroring app from Play Store which is the best app. So this is just the app issue and not related to tv.",
            "Writing after use of 6 months.\nBest in budget TV. Don't compare it with picture quality of sony and LG. As you have to pay double of what you are paying for MI.\n\nBought this Tv in 16500. And fully satisfied with performance.\n\n1. TV channels are clear enough even for Non- HD channels.\n\n2. Sound is very good.\n\n3. Internet connectivity is good. I can play any ott channel without any issue.\n\n4. Screen Cast is not Good, if you are playing video in your MI mobile and want to cast it on MI tv, then video lags. Voice and video are different.\n\n5. After watching your MI tv, if you watch LG and Sony, then definitely you will feel picture quality difference. But why to do that.\n\nVerdict : Good tv in budget. If you are looking for showoff to your guests then buy sony. If you want a best budget class TV with all features and 90 percent of picture quality of sony/LG, this TV suits to your home and pocket.",

            "The TV is a good trade, keeping the price point in mind, but if we see the features singularly, we'll find traces of price cutting attitude from Xiaomi in almost every point. But, it is still reasonable. Only sound is a point where I find it very poor and recommend the prospective buyers to keep a budget of around 5k to 6k higher to their TV budget coz you'll definitely sense a need for getting a good sound system (be it soundbar or home theater) to upgrade the poor sound quality that the TV emits out of its bottom facing speakers.\nRest, I find the product good and price worthy.",

I'm using hotstar, Netflix and Zee5 and some inbuilt apps like youtube. For these apps I'm getting some nice user experience.\n3. Power on taking some 1 minute after the system update recently by google.\n4. You can't directly cast your full mobile screen to TV. For that you need a wifi connection in which the TV and your mobile should be connected.\n5. Most of the application has its own casting options, so that you can directly cast only that apps (youtube, hotstar, amazonprime as such) over your mobile hotspot to tv.\n6. MxPlayer is not supporting to this TV.\n7. Remove is very lite and small. It is easy to hold. And you can operate within 10 to 15 metre radius.\n\nOverall experience, good.",

            "Good tv with great versatility but the picture quality is not good,average contrast and average brightness .\nBut great size under 25k with lots of features.\nAfter installing the android 9 update ,the tv was slow and I faced many problems regarding wifi and connectivity.\nAlso my tv does not support usb card reader and usb gamepad as well.\nGood service via flipkart.",
            "This MI 4a Pro Lead smart Android Tv good product picture and sound quality is very good.\nBut the installation technician is not have enough knowledge about this product.\nHe i.e the technician is doesnot have knowledge in all features. Of this product.\nFinally i am not satisfy the installation of this product",
            "It is no way less than any other smart TV of leading brands. We can say that it is better because it has full fledged android experience with Google Play Store.\n\n\nI deduct one star because it becomes in functional while update of operating system for long period of time. It is better to have dumb tv with Apple TV/Fire Tv or Mi Tv box. At least one can enjoy set top box tv channels while games/software is installing or updating in progress.",
            "Best in quality, the picture quality is also good sound is also really high, but willing doing casting you required google home app in your mobile, you can not directly cast your mobile. Other then thta everything is superb.",
            "If you need a big screen TV in budget so it is for you\nSound is so so\nBut connectivity is so bad\nIf you want to connect your mobile with TV so it's not support mirror screen it's support Chromecast in which you can see only online or Google application and you Know how 4G work in our country \ud83d\ude1c\nSo it's major problem if network is baad in your Area and also I try to connect my mobile with USB cable but it's support it, so I need USB to HDMI cable then it's show on my TV that's it",
            "Very good product for its price. Gives its competitor a run for their money by providing many features. Patchwall is great. Groups the content very well. Im not going to complain about the picture quality.. lets say its decent at this price. Sound levels are okay for a small room. Overall, a great tv for people who are looking to buy a good tv with budget constraint. Go for it",
            "I expected too much but worth of money ok, wall mounted pay extra money, and picture quality sound quality I expect more ok, and compare with Sony smart led 32\" best review this product so only I purchased but no equal to sony",
            "this mi led smart TV is superb the pic quality is good and connectivity feature are good to work as well as sound is great I'm so satisfying with the led tv and im most thankfully for flipkart because the installation service is good and free of cost thank you flipkart",

            "you need TV remote every time to switch on the tv.\n\nyou can't control from single remote (set top box remote)\n\n5years old Samsung LED TV picture quality is better than this MI tv.\n\nno spdif (fiber) port for home theater.",

            "Great TV with lots of features. It has built in Chrome cast feature which means u dnt have to bother about ur phone, just share and lock the phn..it will do the rest by its own...The remote has dedicated Netflix and prime video buttons, with a built in mic and dedicated google assistant key. Thanks MI for this spontaneous improvement to your products...",
            "considering the price & feature compare to other brand it's best brand.but if some one already using samsung or Sony tv than he will easily differentiat the display quality.considering price it's good but not good those want full hd experience .",
            "Nothing can beat it in terms of price. you can not get a flagship smartphone in 23k but you can get a TV with really good picture quality and sound. i have connected my pc with the TV and i enjoy playing Games like Star Wars : Jedi Fallen Order or Borderlands 3 on a 43\" display. and it now supports Netflix \u2764",
            "Wow, Full to Cinematic surrounding sound experience. Great LED tv in budget price.. with pure android experience, great Picture quality pls use HD Channels for better TV Viewing experience.. Good JOB by MI Corporation..Thanks MI",
            "# 8 months after review # MI tv features are quite impressive but it takes 20 to 30 sec to boot up. and this is really frustrating everytime time you start tv you need to wait 30 sec to wait for actually screen. I need to add 1 of the valuable point is dont look out for android based tv in low price range because yet it is not successful. you will feel major lag out while running applications ..better way is that just go for smart tv like samsung and LG which takes hardly 2 sec to start after switch on plug.",
            "1. Picture quality is awesome with this price\n2. Sound is Great\n3. WiFi direct is not available, We can use Mirror screen via Google Home Application and Gallery Acess via All Screen Application (Internet access required to intial connect),\n4. Bluetooth is working well, i have connected my JBL Headset and its fine\n5. We Can use 4 GB of Internal memory only out of 8GB\n6. Default video player is not supported for all audio format, So we need to install VLC Player or KODI player which is working too good\nTotally worth for money, no issues found yet",
            "I have been using the TV for almost 3 months and I think I can give a fair review now. I got it for 8900 rupees after discounts.\n\nPros:\n1. Casting is easy. You can simply connect it to your mobile hotspot and the cast screen or cast youtube.\n2. YouTube is pre installed so you can login to your google account and start watching. (or use without logging in, your wish)\n3. Sound is decent. It isn't too much to replace your speakers, but it is more than enough in a room or even a small hall. 20W is enough for a large room/small hall.\n4. If you want more sound, you can always connect the bluetooth speakers or normal speakers with aux cable.\n5. You can use the normal TV remote or download any android TV remote app from google playstore and use it.\n6. Connecting a laptop via HDMI cable is also very easy and I often do that. You can also use a pendrive for that.\n\nCons:\n1. You cannot use too many apps in the TV. After installing Netflix, Prime Video, Hotstar etc, if you still want to add few more apps, the loading will become slower and casting will also not work properly.\n2. You won't get Netflix/Prime pre-installed in it. There's an update approx 900MB in size which includes the apps. You need to install it to use those apps.\n\nAny further pros/cons I figure out while using the TV, I will update my review with them. Hope it helped.",

I would say it is basic tv.",

Android TV & Chromecast works excellent & adds whole new way of using Television.\nSoftware is fast, though it lags during the first 5 mins after turning on the TV.\nCan sideload almost all the Android apps. Official Play store have very limited numbers of Apps & Games. Patchwall is super fast and agile. Better then Android TV in terms of speed.\nOverall it is the must have SMART TV to buy because it offers way to much in the name of Android Tv compared to other non-android SmartTVs.\nHope all the streaming services like Netflix & Prime Video soon launch their official apps. Although Chromecast works fine meanwhile.",
            "Writing review after using it for 10 days. Everything looks fine in this price range. For best picture quality use HDMI cable for connecting STB. You need to configure the color setting. Sound quality is not as good as Sony. Lacking Picture sharpness but good in this range. On connecting to any Bluetooth speaker, volume decreases. during installation it took too much time micast my mobile but finally done. Wall mount device and HDMI cable should must be provided by Mi, as others are providing in same or less price. After all Flipkart has provided on time delivery and installation. You can go for this if u want to spend some less money.",

            "This is worth with this price but Im not much satisfied due to performance of the tv. Sometimes the tv is restarting when we teying to connect other wifi network. Also if you switched on your tv then you need to wait for 2 to 3 mins to open, its like a mobile device. But in my view tv should be switched on when we turn on the tv, we should not wait for more than 3 mins to see the picture. Wifi network is not refreshing if we turn any new wifi device. Screen mirroring is very worst, playing like a buffering videos. So worth for this money. If you compromise the aforesaid issues, llease go ahead with this. Thanks",

True theatrical experience,\nThe one's saying casting problem is that only direct casting is not available you have to connect to the hotspot of your mobile and the app to be casted should support casting too\neg:- Hotstar . Very good behaviour from the installation executive and fast, free and convenient (time and date) installation.

Lot of forums suggested to use external speakers however, they also describe that the TV is compatible or works better only with specific speakers. Some also suggest the bad sound quality is because it has speakers under the TV, and works better when placed it on a table instead of hanging on the wall. Not happy at all with the purchase.",

Received the product on scheduled date with same day installation,They don't give wall mount and remote batteries in the pack\nPicture quality is Good with this price Default color settings are little fade but i customized it from settings.Sound is Great ,WiFi direct is not available, We can use Mirror screen via Google Home Application and Gallery Acess via All Screen Application (Internet access required to intial connect),some times it dont work thats the only issue in MI TV 32inch thatsy im giving 3 star.Bluetooth is working well,if you are looking a TV in 12K range then u can purchase MI TV ,and you have enough money then i will suggest you to take 17K model (40 Inch). 32 inch clarity is justt okay with that price model. they also gives you 2 year warranty in panel. anyway normal LED model have a life cycle of minimum 3 year. so we no need to take any complete tv protection for MI Tvs.\n\nGood Product, can say value for money",

And facing the problem of screen mirroring but that was my fault.. TV is good if you want to use the Miracast features you must have a router. Without router Miracast is not possible. After using the router I am facing no problem all are good Miracast working very well. I think no company will provide this kind of features in this budget. I am very happy and fully satisfied with this TV. Thanks to Flipkart and thanks to MI for providing us such a good quality TV. I am giving 6 star out of 5.. thanks again for supporting Flipkart and the MI service centre.",

            "Changed my opinion AFTER SYSTEM UPDATE.\n\nIt's got released a new updated recently and that include\n1. Turn on directly into TV/AV/HDMI/USB mode without doing anything ( So much helpful for my parents to operate )\n2. PIE android update. Of course good but it has some cons. Read below.\n3. Certified Netflix, Amazon prime and hotstar.\n4. No more annoying patchwall forcement.\n\nHere's my experience with the TV so far\n\nPros :\n1. Size of TV is good enough for a mid-sized living room and thin bezels gives an immersive feel.\n2. Display is clear, sharp and well saturated. Of course not OLED quality but you'll enjoy for sure. Best for the price range.\n3. Sound is good. Loudness is very high that it could be hear in any corner of larger hall. No need to plan for any additional speaker if you wish to place in mid-sized room.\n4. The remote is magic. It connects to TV as soon as TV powered up. You'll never know that's a wireless remote. It feels as functional as IR but works in any direction.\n5. The awesome thing is using android tv remote app or mi tv remote app to control the TV. ( To the lazy people out there )\n6. There are many more but cons are what we more interested into.\n\nCons : These are my honest experiences while using TV. I'll mention even little frustration things also.\n\n1. Auto power on isn't present. I know I'm asking high for a TV in this budget but I wanted my tv to auto turn on power on so that my parents need not to search for remote and press the power button on remote.\n2. ~2 min booting time (starting time). Well yeah, the ANDROID TV. Better we just got something like softboot here.\n3. No miracast. Only screencast provided. Let me make it clear, screencast needs internet to cast the screen while miracast doesn't. Miracast is deprecated from pie.\n4. Drinking data heavily. If you are a guy like me visiting home once in a while and using hotspot for accessing Android services, you'll cry daily. Within a half an hour of watching content 1.5 will expire. With data saver turned on, it lasts 20 mins more. Not complaining.\n5. You can't use external/phone remote keyboard to search in youtube. You have to select each button to enter text or have to use voice search.\n6. Mismatch audio volume for TV and Android UI. I need to raise volume higher on TV IN and lower on using android UI.\n7. Laggy and slow UI. My fingers on remote are way faster than TV here.\n8. NO RECENT APPS. Like other android TVs this one doesn't have recents apps view. i.e, you can't switch between recently opened apps. It will close an app if you come back. No an issue.\n\nThese were the minor issues that I've come across so far. But those things can't even disturbed my love upon this TV. Everytime I turn on, it feels amazing and the tactile feel of buttons on remote is heaven. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nPlan. Research. Decide. Buy. Enjoy !",

On the other hand in sony or Samsung tv's we can screen cast without internet. Overall quality is good compared to price. I purchased this TV on 3 no cost EMI. with Flipkart 3 year complete protection which cost me Rs.18271 at the time of checkout and on payment page, now my bank sent me notification to pay Rs.6222 + GST which is too much and Flipkart people are not taking any action.\nTV quality is good if we use HD connection with HD channels.

            "This TV is meant for those who desire to see in large screen with less money ..\nYou can't expect Crisp sharp colour as we see in Sony ,Samsung like high branded one ..Better buy 32\" Sony or Samsung or LG for this price .. Expected lot but exited with disappointment .. As there is no return but only replacement , so think more before buying this ... Trust me guys",

Excellent sound quality from the speakers.\n4. Best connectivity you can ask for. Wifi, Bluetooth, Chromecast.... a lot!\n\nCons:\n1. Picture colour changes on changing the viewing angle horizontally.\n2. Cannot dim the TV backlight or turn off display while playing music. Xiaomi should work on this to provide shortcuts for turning off display or dimming the lights while music playback.\n3. The storage is a bit less, limited to 4GB usable memory.\n\nOverall: A must buy for the price!",

I watch Airtel HD channels on it and it is simply spectacular. Add to that the credibility of Xiaomi, I believe the deal during Big Billion days was a steal. However , I had a bad experience with Flipkart. It took them 39 days to fulfill the order and I haven't even received any apology from them. However, the product itself is quite good and if you are getting it under 20k, go for it blindly.",

The jeeva service is pathetic, the better thing that customer satisfaction is required post instalation which is taken by Flipkart/ mi call center where you can lodge ur dissatisfaction. overall, i recommend ppl to buy this. i bought it with 3 yrs warranty, but, the t&c of guaranteed return needs to be explorred before opting.",

            "The TV is nice. I won't say Spectacular or anything because I have seen far better panels. But in this price point, this is the best TV you can have. Booting up the TV takes some time for sure may be because of Android interface. Voice control and navigation are quite easy. Screen quality is good enough and HD content play very good. In built sound is adequate for a small room.\nThis panel isn't HDR so don't expect HDR content\nOne problem I always face with WiFi. The TV never gets connected to wifi automatically. it's an error or what i dont know. But everytime I have to go to settings and then Click on WiFi to get wifi connected. Though I don't put my password on daily basis, it has the password in its memory but it doesn't connect to it automatically.\nThe TV doesn't come with HDMI ARC. Now a days HD audio is a feature for home theatres and this doesn't give you HDMI ARC support. This TV clearly is built for the Soundbar from Mi as the soundbar also doesn't have HDMI ARC support.\nAnother huge complaint I have with Mi is The TV DOESN'T COME WITH ANY CABLES.

            "Bought this TV for one of the guest rooms.\n\nPROS\n1. Picture quality is very good.\n2. Easy to use and very crisp and simple UI. Navigating and locating settings was quite self explanatory.\n3. The TV looks very appealing and the connector panel behind is very convenient than most other TVs that I've used.\n4. Leaves a good amount of space from the wall mounted, thus giving it improved room for circulation as compared to other LED TVs.\n5. The remote is sleek.\n\nCONS\n1. Need an AV button on the remote. That would make it easier to use. A more detailed remote would help. Especially for users who are not comfortable using firestick like controls to manage their TV. For me personally, this isn't an issue.\n2. Sound quality could use some improvement.\n\nP.S. Haven't tested the connectivity, as this TV is for guests' use and not personal use.\n\nAll in all a highly recommended TV for the rate. I loved it. If looking for a medium budget LED TV, this is the one to go for.",

No matter at what side of the room you sit. You gonna have the best view.\n2. Sound quality of the TV is great. You don't need to add any other speaker if you are a sound listener.\n3. Remote control - Bluetooth enabled\nThat's really a revolution in TV segments. It is quick, it doesn't need a direction. It's flawlessm\n4. Bluetooth connectivity in the TV.\nYeah you read it correct, no need to buy any wire to connect your bluetooth enabled speakers. Now just plug and play.\n5. Inbuilt chrome cast - Last but not the least. This feature of the TV makes it complete. Along with the provided different apps you get the freedom to cast through your mobile/laptop and enjoy the show.\n\nAlso, You might not get Netflix and Amazon at time when you start the TV but just give it some time with the internet connectivity. Once it download an update both the above options will be on the go.\n\nHope my this review helps others to decide. ?",

Also eye protection mode removed from settings in this model. It was a good feature and should remain in color/picture settings. There should be more color customization or modes for better viewing experience. Overall good buy at this price.",

            "I purchased the Mi smart 32\" 4A pro series tv just 3 days before.\n1) the picture quality is not that great, because the contrast and LED backlight is set to maximum so the home screen looks more bright whitish, if we reduce the brightness this may further kill the clarity of the display. otherwise it's ok.\n2) the sound quality is very good, with 20 - 25% volume it's loud and clear.\n3) connectivity: all my devices at home works well with my broadband Wi-Fi connection but not the Mi Tv. I myself resolved by adding wifi repeater.\n4) value for money: Really it's not, the LED panel glass is not that great it's thin and delicate with little pressure applied while cleaning it may break. this is not the same case with LG, Panasonic and Samsung. but due to competition most of the LED TVs in the market uses this variety only (China). look out for IPS LED panel presence is good.\n5) the TV installation technicians are real joker's they really don't know any thing other than selling wall mount kit stand. they charged me 1800/- but the same stand is available in Flipkart for 650/-. !!! as per them they sell only original.!!!\n\nmy overall experience is 3 stars in a scale of 5",

However, the pacthwall and connectivity to OTT platform like YouTube and Hotstar will need a very powerful internet connection if you are using at home. Though it connects with WIFI very well. However, for a better experience of patchwall and other smart TV features a very strong internet connection via router is required. The installation of MI was not smooth as had a tough time with the technician not turning up on time and forgetting to provide proper demo. Had to followup with technician a lot for installation and demo. One less star for the hard time with logistics and technicians.",

Today Mi has the newer 4K TV which is offered at only 2K more than what I purchased it for.\n\nThe TV has excellent panel which produces good colours and brightness. The sound is alright. The patchwall interface is nothing great but I have learned to live with it. With the limited keys on the remote you will have to come to patchwall to change between sources which is slightly annoying. I loaded Prime Video, Jio Cinema, Jio TV from Aptoide. You can search on YouTube to find out how to add these apps. Prime and Jio Cinema work great. Jio TV app that I installed did not work well.\n\nI feel it is a good TV especially given that the 4K version did not exist when I bought it. The only cons I can point out is the limited remote and the slow boot time.",

After last update, the TV gets connected with WiFi & Bluetooth speaker automatically once it is ON. Mi updates the software when necessary. The voice search button, searchs everything and open it in youtube as there is no browser in TV. The play store in TV do not have amazon prime, Netflix apps in it, but you can get them with alternate options. Over all, I just love this TV. Android TV's are future and this Mi TV is one of the best of it all. Go for it \ud83e\udd1f\ud83e\udd1f",

You have to download an APK version and install it in TV.

HD Video is truly good on screen.\n\nCons: Sometimes voice command does not work instantly....may be due to low RAM/Processor. Input method can not be saved hence you have to select HDMI for TV/Video and other connected inputs EVERYTIME. TV connectivity should be automatically but it is missing.\n\nAlthough worth buying.",

The most useful feature that I wasn't expecting the bluetooth. It has given me full freedom to control the smart TV and bluetooth accessories. I can listen my shows on bluetooth headset and can control the TV from any room via bluetooth remote.\n\nExcellent Product\nThanks",

Service engineer also came and installed the TV on same day of delivery.\n\nOverall performance of the TV is really good till now. and as expected 'Mi' never disappoints in terms of features and offerings.\n\nperfect buy at the price range of 12.5k. Great work team- Mi.",
            "Nice Television. It is quite a smart TV.\n-It has built-in wi-fi connectivity. once connected you can see you tube etc. directly.\n- Being Android the remote facilitates voice commands, but the TV should be connected, Google Assistant provides all help. So you are spared the nightmarish typing from the remote.\n-USb pendrives work smoothly.There is a very primitive audio player.\n- Overall a good television.\n- Not talking about reliability because less than a month now.\n- For sync with Mobile you have to use Google Home app and log into Google even from TV.\n- There is no Mobile to TV image push etc.So I could not view my phone images directly. Mobile connectivity is limited.\n- Viewing angles are satisfactory.\n- I could not adjust the picture brightness/contrast etc. while viewing the channel as the remote has very limited buttons. So picture settings you have to do relying on your judgement.\n- Finally for the price it is a very good package which allows you all inputs - From Dish/ from internet and from usb.\n\nFlipkart delivery was prompt and timely.\nFor installation I had to persue with the agency otherwise I had received SMS of later schedule but phone calls to Flipkart and agency ensured installation and demo as promised by Flipkart. So full marks to Flipkart.",

Sound Quality is Very Impressive.Just a bit harsh at top volume but you will never need it, sufficient sound at low volume.\n2. Picture Quality is Amazing. I watched Avengers Endgame at 1080 BR and it looked damn sexy.\n3. Optimum Brightness and colour reproduction.\nCons:\n1. Connectivity for mirroring device is very poor. Other connection work fine.\n2. Limited application but Side loading apps is easily workable.\n3. Takes a lot of time to Install Apps from playstore.\n\nAll ports work just great not a single issue.",

Very satisfied with the delivery and installation.\nI would like to point out one very imp thing for normal tv viewers regarding the pucture quality. Most of you might be aware that the normal SD channels will not be clear in HD television. The SD channels(that we receive from cable operators and dth providers) will be very clear in older televisions but will look blurred in HD television. We need to upgrade our cable tv or dth package to HD for enjoying the full benefit of a HD television.\nSo far very satisfied with MI tv, excellent value for money.

            "I was a bit skeptical before purchasing this TV, but it turned out to be a good purchase.\n\nPrice: ( 9/10). Its a great TV at this price, but I am only giving it 8 because the price fell by 1000 a week after I purchased this item.\n\nBuilt: (8/10). I was using LG Tv previously and could actually see the difference in build quality. LG Tv was much more durable and had used much stronger material. Even the back panel was completely sealed, unlike MI Tv where you can see internal lights and wiring from the back. Having said that MiTv is also not that bad. The frame looks fine from the front and is not very delicate. Also, given that there is a price difference of around 10K between LG and MITv, I feel its a good buy.\n\nColors and Contrast: (9/10). A lot of people had pointed out that there are certain issues with brightness. I actually did not feel any. Just turn off the backlight and it works fine. The colors are also nice.\n\nConnectivity: (9/10). The connectivity is good. It provides a wide range of connectivity options like USB, wifi, ethernet, Bluetooth. I did face a little problem with casting and bluetooth connectivity. The casting would stop midway and sound in my wireless headphones would break. So I connected my TV directly with router using Cat6 cable ( which cost Rs.120/15m). I haven't faced any issues with casting since then.\n\nUI: (8/10). UI is pretty good. You can actually go for Pitchwall home screen or MI default homescreen.\n\nPitchwall: (2/10) Almost all content on pitchwall is paid.\n\nApps: It has a lot of apps available on playstore. And those not available on playstore can be installed via usb. ( Hint: You may encounter an error while playing certain videos through USB. Do not panic, download MX player from the store and they will work.)\n\nDelivery: On time delivery\n\nInstallation: Same day installation.\n\nThis is a great buy Tv at this price range. Go for it.",

            "The only thing lacking in this product is a full hd 1080p panel. If MI can provide 1080p panel in this size then i would have rated 5 stars. Sound quality & clarity is better than most led TVs in this price range. Chromecast and patch wall works flawlessly.",
            "Picture Quality is good.. Sound quality is very good. Delivery and installations were done on time.\n\nConnectivity is the main pain point. Normally its works fine but sometimes it is unable to detect even a 50 Mbps connection which leads to Youtube getting stuck and ultimately youtube app crashes.\n\nI too had the same experience where i got a call from a random guy saying i won a tata safari in flipkart lucky draw or i can collect corresponding cash. That guy had all the information like which tv i bought, my address, pincode etc. This is something that flipkart needs to take care as customer's information is getting leaked to fraudsters",

I say its a value for money. you can definitely go for 40 inch model but the only difference is 32 inch model has a resolution of 720p and 40inch with resolution of 1080p. I suggest you all to first try to search the difference between google certified android tv and smart tv. Yes you read it right there is a huge difference between the two. Consider it before making a choice\ud83d\udc4d",

I totally rely on Wifi to stream online content via Netflix, Prime Video, Hotstar & Zee5. I have a 100mbps broadband which is more than enough to stream on both TVs concurrently.\nTHis TV stream content pretty well. The TV is primarily used by parents to watch evening shows & its perfect for that purpose. Being an Andriod TV helps a lot. I can mirror phone & even cast easily.\nOS can be a bit slow sometime but thats okay for the price. The BT remote is lovely.",

MI has released a update and it enhances the performance of the UI firther.\nthe WiFi connectivity is also amazing. the inclusion of an ethernet port is also good.

No brightness issue, you have to adjust custom display settings. watch from some distance for good experience.\n\nSound :-\nSound is not impressive. Speakers are loud but sound Quality is not like LG or Sony tv.\n\nSmart TV Features :-\nThis tv has Android 8.1 Oreo, You can Play YouTube, More Entertainment and other apps are available on playstore.\n\nScreen Cast and Connectivity :-\nYou can Cast your smartphone screen only with Google Home App, which also Required internet. This is not good as compare to other brands tv which provide direct screen cast without any app. Remote is good, comes with Bluetooth connectivity and Voice assistant feature. No Wifi connectivity issue.\n\n\nDelivery and installation service :-\nDelivery is Good but installation is scheduled to next day but again rescheduled and done on 4th day after delivery. you have to wait for installation and before installation by company you can't self unbox or install it otherwise Replacement or warranty not provided by company, informed by flipkart customer executive. i called flipkart care for installation issue but they tell me they can look in to complain and provide solution after 5 days time. This is worst as they required 5 days to look only for 1 days installation issue. finally installation completed on 4th day, technician was good and experienced bt not expect quick Customer support by flipkart. on this place offline market shops can provide quick installation better after sell service and support.",
            "Firstly let me get the bad out of the way. Sound is loud enough for an average room but not for a large living room or hall space. It also lacks bass. Now coming to the pros. Connectivity is good and everything. 1080p or 4k videos bring out the picture quality but understandably don't expect eye popping clarity on normal TV channels (non-HD). The best thing about it is the price-point. You possibly won't find any better options in this budget. Xiaomi service providers are always happy to help and well behaved on calls. A great buy all-in-all. Also Flipkart installation was very quick, they came the next day, but the behaviour of the person was inadequate or kind of bad by my standards.",

            "I recently purchased this TV and it's awesome,Not happy with installation services.\nthis TV really worth the money but Android updates are very few.if you want to enjoy Android TV must buy atleast 10mbps plan otherwise you will not get that much enjoyment of internet.",
            "If you expecting Good SMART tv then don't buy MI, they do not have support for media apps. even preinstalled apps won't work sometimes",
            "great product Loved it chromcast is litel bit uneasy to use or it is not good up to mark otherwise it is great television just connection with phone mirroring is not up to mark everything else is great nice picture quality sound is good Wi-Fi connection is lil bad connection first connected as no internet then have to wait 1-2 minutes to get it going",
            "This LED Android Oreo TV is amazing. Just update your television when you start it for the first time. Actually, MI has introduced an update which will resolve all connectivity issues related to Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and after this update this television works flawlessly. This TV is total value for money and much better compared to Sony / LG / Samsung which are charging so high in same specification. An update is around 800MB including system as well as application. Jio TV application works fine and there is no lagging. HD channels are superb. Kindly, note this 32\" inch has a resolution of 720p but can also play 1080p by downscaling video quality and your eyes won't be able to differentiate between picture quality. In SD channels the red colour effect is little bit more which appears to be artificial but in HD there is no such issue. I am writing this review after 10 days of usage. So, those who are planning to buy it, then go for it.",
            "Perfect smart tv at this price......... brilliant picture quality and great sound....... connectivity is slow....but good....for casting",

You will nothing compromise except brand name. anyways if you get warranty then there is noting matter. everything is use and throw afterwards\n\npros -\nless price and more features\n\ncons -\nplastic quality all around cheap. including table top stand included inside.\nno wall mounted stand available. need to purchase externally.\n\nbut overall good with price.",

Thanks to MI for a good product at unbeatable price.\n\nplayed 720p, 1080p and 4k videos on it. picture quality remain the same. so did the audio. base is bad at higher volumes.. but remember its a tv not a stereo system. connection to a stereo or external speakers for sound quality enhancement.\n\nplayed games via ps4.. it was flawless. hdmi link works but not very accurate. very simplified remote. can be controlled by smart phones via androi tv remote app.",

            "Review after 1 week use:\nTV will receive a 750 mb android OTA update, whenever it connects to the internet.\nafter that , There is option for hdmi autoplay.\nCons:\n1.If we connect a normal external stereo speaker via 2.5mm jack and When we play a video with 5.1 audio , The sound from the speaker will be low, even after the volume of tv is at its maximum. (this ia because of 5.1 channel can't automatically converted into 2.0 stereo).\nBut the issue can be fixed by listening from TV speaks. However there is no issues while watching TV channels or videos with Mono/Stereo audio.\n* Netflix&Amazon Prime apps are not available , neither can't install from usb(wont work). Can be play via a browser.\n\n\nPros:\n*Pictures are Crisp and clear\n*Built in Chromecast is very useful\n* in USB Playback,almost all format video supports after installing MX Player\n*Playstore support\n* also can download apks from internet and install directly to the TV\n*Aptoid app increases the TV app availability\n\nOverall , Value for money.",

Apparently they were out of wall mount bracket. Finally I brought my own bracket. But be prepared to do a lot of follow up with no concrete answers from Flipkart. However once the person who came to do the installation was knowledgeable and presentable.\n\nPicture Quality - Overall picture quality is good. But could be better in terms of brightness.\n\nConnectivity - Can connect anything and stream using WiFi, USB or HDMI. Plenty of ports available.\n\nRemote - Very sleek remote. But difficult to type up searches. Its easy to speak and search, which is kinda cool.\n\nOverall TV is much better than expected and for the price its offered. The question still remains as to what is the durability. By the way this TV is designed to move away from Cable / Dish provider. It shows Hotstar, YouTube and such apps up front if default is not selected.",

Voice control takes a few seconds to start recording, the delay is quite long sometimes and irritating.\n\nSound : Sound is very loud. Even with a bit of volume, it is pretty audible in a big room. But the lows are very bad. Unable to hear low voices if the volume is low. Keeping it loud makes the highs too loud.\n\nThese are the only issues I found.

He said you can transfer image from pen drive to TV memory. But later when I said please transfer data from my pen drive to gallery. He failed to do so.\nFact- Actually the internal memory is for the apps which you download from play store.\n\n2. He said external speakers will not get connected because it is using blah blah things.\nFact-External Speakers can be connected so simple there is port available in TV.\n\n3.He didn't know about Google cast. He said ask customer care, I can't to do anything.\nFact-It is very easy to connect by using Google home app. Simply go in profile of the app chose the option mirroring and it will work.\n\nOther than the defective demo \ud83d\ude01person the TV justifies all the quality to be called as best seller.

Sometimes it is hard to connect with Bluetooth.\nAnd 1 major thing everyone should have known, I just realized that whenever i start my tv it always shows the default set date and time not the exact date and time whether I have already setted up date and time as current are before switch off the tv.\nOverall it is good. and value for money of this segment's smart/android TV.",

I have seen cover of wall mount after their visit and TV is not straight on the wall slightly sliding from one side . Jeeves given me name of one person and for installation 2 another guys coming to install and not on time . time slot given me 12 to 1 PM and installation done on 4.30 pm . I m not satisfied by installation they don't have proper mi wall mount and not given bill of wall mount.",

Why don't u take care of it as still there is no improvement in this regard",
            "This is a review after a using for 1 month.\n\nJust ask two questions before buying it.\n\nQ. Why should one buy it?\nA. First of all, easy on pocket. You get one of the best TV for half of the price of Sony Samsung and other competitors.\n* Display is good enough for SD set top box (but HD is recommended).\n* Built quality is very good, similar to it's competitors.\n* Sound is loud and clear, but if you need home theater quality you will have to connect an external Bluetooth sound system.\n* WiFi connectivity is super fast and gets connected with ease.\n* Patchwall works fine. just need a account to watch all content.\n* Overall the experience is amazing. Very happy to have this TV.\n\nQ. Why shouldn't one but it.\nA. I don't see any reason for not buying it.\n\nSO JUST GO FOR IT...",

Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Connectivity- 10/10. Design- 8/10. ( no problem if you wall mount it.). Ports- 10/10. (All ports are easily accessible even if TV is wall mounted.) Chromecast- 10/10.

            "On the receipt of the product , had a doubt whether it is a smart TV as the product description was not carrying the word Smart TV. It is an Android based smart TV. Model No L43M5-AB\n\nI had actually purchased this smart TV based on a recent review stating that the issue of no option of HDMI auto-play can be overcome by enabling input settings to - Stay on the previous source. But I could not find any such settings option for this particular model. Mi support team also later confirmed that HDMI auto play option is not available for this model. The installation technician has conveyed that this option was available for the previous model, but not for this. Really need to explore further for any possible settings option .\n\nThe need to select the source each time you switch on the smart TV is an inconvenience as mostly we will be using the TV to watch DTH channels. It is really difficult for elderly people to choose the source through the remote control.\n\nThe smart TV is otherwise good and is a value for money product. No issue on the picture quality or sound or connectivity. Have set up the Mi IR Cable for controlling the DTH set top box as well .",
            "TV is great. As some one mentioned we can stick to same source in inputs it is wrong(Please think and and write your review so that it will not affect some one who is buying ). As if now that option is not available . Always you should go for selecting source with TV remote, it will be problem for old parents if you are buying for them. Screen mirroring is not working for me with my Samsung mobile. over all I am using it with tatasky hd setup box. it is doing great in terms of picture quality and sound. same day delivery and installation great work flipkart and Jeeves.",

I would suggest you not to do it, also if you can return it then do it asap and don't buy a tv with 1080p resolution/40 inch/ 43 inch regardless of any company, rather then that buy a HD ready/32 inch tv cause the performance will be the same in both or else look for a TV that comes with at least 2 gb ram.",

You will not see much sound difference once the volume goes above 40-50 and it remains same but it's not less sound.\n2.

Here are few things I would like highlight.\n1 .If you're not into softwares and tweaking too much and just wanto have better TV experience just go for VU ultra smart.\n2 .The display of this TV lags behind in quality to that of VU as you are able to see tints of blue instead of black (which was not the case in VU.)\n3 .Theres definately an issue with in built wireless connectivity as it loses internet connection every now and then which wasn't the case with my previous tv. I had to connect it via Ethernet in the end. If you connect your bluetooth for audio the sound lags behind by a second or so.\nOverall an average TV hardware with great Patchwall 2.0 experience.\nhoping things for problem to get solved by an Update.",

TV inbuild sound is good.\n3. Can play videos in Full HD including 4K and 8K (Able to play in youtube).\n4. Have a set of apps in play store for entertainment.\n\nBad\n-----------------------------\n1. Provided play store is having very few apps.\n2. Most important no support for Google Chrome App. When installed from pen remote is not working and unable to operate the app. I tried installing Google Chrome, Opera, Netflix, Amazon Prime.\n3. No Support for Amazon Prime videos also.\n4. Built-in Chrome cast works for mobile but Laptop Google Chrome browser unable to find even though both are in the same network but using ES Explorer on TV I'm able to connect FTP Server running on my laptop and can transfer files as well.\n\nOverall in my view considering all the negative and positive points of the TV it should be called a smart TV with minimal support to smart apps.\nAt least it's not full android TV.\n\nBetter I will suggest buy a normal HD/Full HD TV and attach Fire Stick which will make your TV smarter than the Smart OS this TV provides and ask for more money.\n\nHope this review helps other to save money.",

If you are really concerned about good picture use HD set top boxes for AV mode. SD Set top boxes' picture quality also looks decent.\n\nRegarding sound, MI TV's DTS technology is awesome. I can give 5/5.\n\nSpeaking about connectivity, MI TV disappointed me a lot. Chromecast has no issues when the mobile and TV are connected to same WiFi network. Screen casting is not at all working. Whenever we want to cast mobile media to TV, we need to connect both TV and mobile to same network and to use Google home app to mirror my screen. Eventhough i installed Google home app and added my MI TV, TV screen gets stuck in the first screen of the mobile. MI has to seriously look into this issue. 0/5 for this screen mirroring feature, since Chromecast has no issues, i have given a total of 2/5.\n\nApart from this screen mirroring issue, MI TV is totally a value for money product.\n\nRegarding installation service, Flipkart failed to deliver my tv at my doorstep, we went almost 7Km to get the TV from the courier. Installation by Jeeves was really good. Eventhough the stand size which the service engineer carried for the first visit was not of correct size, he ordered a new one and fixed to the wall.

There are very good TVs at the same price. It all looked good till couple of months back i.e till 2yrs and 3 months from the date of invoice, but suddenly TV screen started developing horizontal dotted lines where screen pixels are not displayed. Surprisingly this happened after 2 yrs which is the company\u2019s warranty period. I think even they know that their product will not survive more than 2yrs\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. Service centre ppl now say that the TV screen has to be replaced which costs around 10k. Which is just 1k less than what I paid for the new TV\ud83d\ude02. So please don\u2019t buy this product\u2026 there are hell lot of good TVs out there\u2026",

Only con is sound , sound is very low when watching a movie u cant get vocals audible if u increase the volume the back ground score is huge . Its bit difficult to deal with sound , so i decided to go for a mi sound bar which works great awsome , movie experience connected with bluetooth and there is no delay in sound while on bluetooth connection with sound bar , an external home theatre or sound bar is mandate to get a good movie experience in my view.

The software of the tv was not updated properly by the installation team and even in the customer service help desk they were not able to guide. Finally there was a backend technical team escalation call managed to guide through the software update to play the Prime video app.\nThe remote is long and the fonts on the buttons are dim with the black color of the remote.

Whatever can be expected from a shameless company which is charging 22,999 Rs for a LED will provide free installation. Technician asked me to arrange 2 batteries for remote. After that, a HDMI cable. If it is tough for you people to send even screw for wall mount, then ask the customer. He will arrange the screws too. Wow. What a experience.\nRest, LED is not bad. Can give 2 out of 5 for brightness. Don't know what is the reason of this.\nIf you need sound clarity, attach a sound bar.\nConnectivity is good. It took seconds. Giving 5/5.\nCool.\nCannot blame flipkart for above. Because I think flipkart official never try to check the ground level working. Customer care of flipkart and the technician who visit for installation have different copy of rules. And at that moment, customer don't have a choice.",
