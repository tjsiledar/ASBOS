            "super good TV excellent super picture quality best budget TV remote is excellent super",
            "Edited REVIEW, after a usage of ONE WEEK(Old review can be found after this edited review)\nIts just an excellent TV, doubtlessly in all aspects, except one thing, that is, the mismatching of VIDEO (Lip movement of characters) with sound in the SPEAKERS, in other words we can say that there is no SYNC between SOUND and VIDEO. I didn't observe it in the beginning, but it is clearly noticeable, 2 of my frnds and relatives also noticed this issue, when they visited my home to see the new TV. I'm using airtel DTH HD Plus Set Top Box, I don't know, if this is happening with me or everybody else, the technician who came after making a complaint said that it is due to the fault of Set Top Box, but my old Weston Android 48\" TV used to work fine with the same box, when I connect the audio output from Set Top Box and feed it directly to my SONY home theatre, the Audio is in synchrony with VIDEO on TV, but not in TV speakers. When I turn on Sound in both home theatre and also TV speakers, the time gap between TV's sound and the sound on Home theatre can be easily sensed, which clearly says that, it's the FAULT of TV, I tried several settings for time delay SPDIF section, but nothing worked for me.. Requested a replacement, let me see if that will be a good one...\n\nthank u...\n\n(Old review below)\n\ns a person who has been using SONY 55' 4K UHD TV, which I bought at 2.4 lakhs, 3 years back, I can say that, this TV is no less than any other so called TOP brands.\n\nLet me try to give a detailed opinion on this TV to the extent possible to me:\n\nThe product was delivered by FLIPKART in just 1 and half a day, but it took 1 day more for the JEEVES Engineer to visit my residence for installation.\nThe JEEVES ENGINEER was so untrained that he was handling the TV after opening package, as if a courier person was handling with outer package. I was worried that the TV might be broken as he was holding the TV to lift on the thinner part of the screen. However, I cautioned him again and again to handle it carefully, or leave it so that I get it fixed by some other engineer.\n\nComplaints apart, now let's come to TV.\n\nMy TV is wallmounted, and the TV is an awesome one, it took almost more than a half of my wall's area.\n\nLet me seggregate the PROs and CONs\n\nPROs:\n~Picture quality excellent\n~ound, is more and crispier than my old SONY 55\"4K UHD TV\n~The build quality is so good that it has ALUMINIUM sheets as frame on all 4 sides of the screen\n~Bluetooth connectivity is available (it was not mentioned in the product page and any other YouTube unboxing reviews, hence I thought had no Bluetooth connectivity)\n~UI of software is superb\n~Smart remote is a boon\n~All apps are working just fine\n\nCONs:\n\u00d7 T-cast (Screen mirroring needs an active internet connection with TV and PHONE connected on same network, I didn't understand why this is so, even a basic smart TV nowadays, directly pairs with phone and mirrors the mobile screen\n\u00d7 The buttons of SMART REMOTE are so close to each other that sometimes another button being pressed when trying to press some other button\n\u00d7 No FILE MANAGER app (on default) for browsing the PEN DRIVE DATA, after watching a movie or a video, if you press back, it springs back to HOME SCREEN, and as FILE MANAGER is not available, we need to REMOVE and RE-INSERT for the TV to prompt that \"an EXTERNAL DRIVE is detected, do you want to OPEN it now...?.\"\n\nOn an overall basis, it is just an awesome TV, which needs small amendments, which I hope, will be solved in upcoming updates....\n\nThank you all,\nSrinivas Dhondi, HYD",
            "very good deal and AWESOME purchase..I got it on big billion sale .\n\nMy friends are stunned by seeing this big TV. installation was good and on time. Using stabilizer for safety .\n\nTatasky Setup Box: the SD channels are not good.. HD Channels are good.\n4k content is awesome internet or External drive\nSound:\ncoming to sound , this TV has 3.5 mm port which I connected my 2.1 F&D speakers.. the output is very very good..\ninstalled jiotv app to view Channels with jio gigafiber..\n\none star less for picture quality.. it could be better , but this is price range it is a great quality.\n\nmy rating is 4.5 for this purchase\n\nyou can go for it.",

            "Edited REVIEW, after a usage of ONE WEEK(Old review can be found after this edited review)\nIts just an excellent TV, doubtlessly in all aspects, except one thing, that is, the mismatching of VIDEO (Lip movement of characters) with sound in the SPEAKERS, in other words we can say that there is no SYNC between SOUND and VIDEO. I didn't observe it in the beginning, but it is clearly noticeable, 2 of my frnds and relatives also noticed this issue, when they visited my home to see the new TV. I'm using airtel DTH HD Plus Set Top Box, I don't know, if this is happening with me or everybody else, the technician who came after making a complaint said that it is due to the fault of Set Top Box, but my old Weston Android 48\" TV used to work fine with the same box, when I connect the audio output from Set Top Box and feed it directly to my SONY home theatre, the Audio is in synchrony with VIDEO on TV, but not in TV speakers. When I turn on Sound in both home theatre and also TV speakers, the time gap between TV's sound and the sound on Home theatre can be easily sensed, which clearly says that, it's the FAULT of TV, I tried several settings for time delay SPDIF section, but nothing worked for me.. Requested a replacement, let me see if that will be a good one...\n\nthank u...\n\n(Old review below)\n\ns a person who has been using SONY 55' 4K UHD TV, which I bought at 2.4 lakhs, 3 years back, I can say that, this TV is no less than any other so called TOP brands.\n\nLet me try to give a detailed opinion on this TV to the extent possible to me:\n\nThe product was delivered by FLIPKART in just 1 and half a day, but it took 1 day more for the JEEVES Engineer to visit my residence for installation.\nThe JEEVES ENGINEER was so untrained that he was handling the TV after opening package, as if a courier person was handling with outer package. I was worried that the TV might be broken as he was holding the TV to lift on the thinner part of the screen. However, I cautioned him again and again to handle it carefully, or leave it so that I get it fixed by some other engineer.\n\nComplaints apart, now let's come to TV.\n\nMy TV is wallmounted, and the TV is an awesome one, it took almost more than a half of my wall's area.\n\nLet me seggregate the PROs and CONs\n\nPROs:\n~Picture quality excellent\n~ound, is more and crispier than my old SONY 55\"4K UHD TV\n~The build quality is so good that it has ALUMINIUM sheets as frame on all 4 sides of the screen\n~Bluetooth connectivity is available (it was not mentioned in the product page and any other YouTube unboxing reviews, hence I thought had no Bluetooth connectivity)\n~UI of software is superb\n~Smart remote is a boon\n~All apps are working just fine\n\nCONs:\n\u00d7 T-cast (Screen mirroring needs an active internet connection with TV and PHONE connected on same network, I didn't understand why this is so, even a basic smart TV nowadays, directly pairs with phone and mirrors the mobile screen\n\u00d7 The buttons of SMART REMOTE are so close to each other that sometimes another button being pressed when trying to press some other button\n\u00d7 No FILE MANAGER app (on default) for browsing the PEN DRIVE DATA, after watching a movie or a video, if you press back, it springs back to HOME SCREEN, and as FILE MANAGER is not available, we need to REMOVE and RE-INSERT for the TV to prompt that \"an EXTERNAL DRIVE is detected, do you want to OPEN it now...?.\"\n\nOn an overall basis, it is just an awesome TV, which needs small amendments, which I hope, will be solved in upcoming updates....\n\nThank you all,\nSrinivas Dhondi, HYD",
            "very good deal and AWESOME purchase..I got it on big billion sale .\n\nMy friends are stunned by seeing this big TV. installation was good and on time. Using stabilizer for safety .\n\nTatasky Setup Box: the SD channels are not good.. HD Channels are good.\n4k content is awesome internet or External drive\nSound:\ncoming to sound , this TV has 3.5 mm port which I connected my 2.1 F&D speakers.. the output is very very good..\ninstalled jiotv app to view Channels with jio gigafiber..\n\none star less for picture quality.. it could be better , but this is price range it is a great quality.\n\nmy rating is 4.5 for this purchase\n\nyou can go for it.",
            "The panel in this TV is absolutely brilliant for the price that you pay...! Playing 10 bit 4k videos are amazing. The processing inside is doing okay,pairing with any 4k device with hdmi gives goosebumps on playback. Loved the product, received in a day. Worth buying for the price...!",
            "Booting time too long, settings and menu buttons resound very delayed if more than one applications are opened otherwise each and every 1-2 hours you have to close all opened apps, software hangs, default media player does not have bsic codecs for the audio and video, popular MKV video could not be played in it, you can.t play 4k HDR 60FPS video via any of the USB ports. I asked for the refund but they said only replacement is possible. Sound quality is poor. there is no noticeable difference between pre defind sound modes, no graphic equalizer is present to personalize it.\nIn total to my experience pl do not buy it. go for MI brand or MarQ by Flipkart brand or VU brand for the almost same price.",
            "Initially, I was little scared while ordering as the brand is not very popular. But now I m writing this review very confidently. it is a great product. I got 65 inch tv. Picture quality is very good. sound quality is not that great but I have connected my Bose soundbar & now I m getting a feel seating in auditorium. Tata sky HD channels are looking good. non HD channels are not that good picture quality but that is acceptable. 4K is really amazing. Value for money.....Go ahead with it.",
            "Dear All,\n\nI have recently purchased this TV 65\". The looks and feature of the TV is very good. Delivery and installation was on time as mentioned in the message.\n\nWhile installation of my TV, I sensed the problem with sound and HD channels clarity while playing from Tata Sky. I thought this TV is really bad, but later after doing the changes in Tata Sky Set up box settings from Dolby + to Dolby, sound became very clear and the HD channels settings too changed from 1080/60hz to 1080/50 Hz. Then the quality of HD became awesome.\n\nThis is the best TV for this price in the market as per my analysis. I would strongly recommend this TV .\n\nAll I have to wait and watch is to see how long the TV lasts?",
            "Very good product and value for money, 4k visual amazing Dolby sound is fabulous. This product not for SD set top box, minimum HD channels must be provided for this system.",

            "It's really worth the money.... Though I don't know much about tcl servicing... But the tv is damn worth it... It runs smooth...

            "A near perfect 65 inch TV at such low price. Display quality is exceptional. As this is a 65 inch uhd TV the viewing distance should be around 8 feet for actual picture quality. Sound system is quite good but for movie like experience you need to have a external speaker system. HDR video wherever available (search YouTube or Netflix you will get some=, is quite good. Blacks are actually black and not grey an color reproduction is exceptional.",
            "Outstanding clarity in picture and voice...super value for money...I have Samsung 55 inch UHD , LG 55 inch UHD TV's and the clarity on iffalcon TV is equally good and if not better than the other two..True Android TV with which are rich in features which is superior than samsung and LG TV's.\n\nOne simple word..Truly outstanding..highly recommended..\n\nThe installation and demo from flipkart was also done on the same day with good professionalism..",
            "A very nice budget tv, installation was done in 2-3 days, installation guys were also nice they even recommended us to have a stabilizer and extended warranty for longer protection. Hopefully u'll forget normal cable connection after getting used to streaming HD content on it.",
            "I bought THOMSON TV in the month of July 2019 but that TV was WORSE TV I have ever seen in mine whole life.

            "I always wanted to buy 65'' Android TV, so thank you TCL/iFFALCON from bringing this great TV to India at such affordable price. Watching 4K and HDR 10 Content from Netflix feels like a grand cinematic experience. The Dolby Audio is mind-blowing and I don't feel the need to use my 320W LG SoundBar anymore with this TV. Voice enabled remote is a very cool feature and works smooth as butter!\n\nApps which I use regularly on this TV - Jio Cinema, Hotstar, Sony Liv, Gaana, Spotify etc.\n\nHope Prime Video comes to Android TVs in India soon, then this TV will become a complete entertainment package. Guys, just go for this TV, you will never regret one bit!",
            "I just love this TV. Worth every buck spent on it. Using it for more than a month. On the downside, sometimes there is a lag when you go from one app to another hastily, but everything can be overlooked when considering how little we are paying compared to the so-called top brands. If the big brand TVs score a 100 in performance, this TV would definitely score a 95. I haven't seen the MI TV and don't know about its performance, but I'm willing to bet that this Iffalcon TV is much better.",
            "the display unit is excellent, you have got all types of modern connectivity available. the initial set up was quite fast and all the settings are ready to navigate. though I find this unit not having split screen facility. it would have been a great advantage if this feature was available!\n\nthe Wi-Fi connectivity is really fast and during even gaming programs the response is great. only thing i don't like is the time taking process for the initial start up. but once started it doesn't stop.\nI think this TV is not at all a bad choice when you compare overall with other reputed companies. the sound is good though I can't tell is great!!!!! the sound enthusiastic can go for any good quality sound bar to feel the experience of theatre.",
            "Really this tv is very gud and i brought 65 inches tv i had 1 week of experience, over all i can rate 5 because ....\n\n1) Screen Size worth for money compare to other tv's\n2) Sound Quality is excellent\n3) Picture Quality 4K ultimate but we should have quality of network.\n4) Overall worth for each rupeee.....\n\nif any body interested to buy plse without second thought you can buy this product...",

            "I bought it after reviewing all possible oled, qeld, and other uhd TVs in this size. But being a price conscious customer, I took a bet with this TV for al the reviews I saw on YouTube and Flipkart. And I\u2019m extremely happy with the service, and the product itself. Imagine clarity and colours are reproduced very well. The blacks appear perfectly balanced. And I don\u2019t even need an additional sound system",
            "the TV is working good the 4k quality is just awesome but the smart remote is not working I have inform to manager of iffalcon and they will send a incharge on tomorrow that's only I give a 4 star",
            "i am using this TV for a month and it is good at low prices. Picture quality is not good simply very low quality, don't go for the reviews it will manipulate you. HD quality looks SD and this is not 60hz refresh rate dont go for the description, TV sound quality is low respective of size, y'all should add a good speaker. Go for vu or for some branded tv as tv is known for good picture quality.",
            "Review after 3 months of typical use at home without and STB but only internet streaming content. I stream varied content with quality ranging from Low Res to UHD HDR10. The TV delivers what it promises. Nice colors, sharpness, and contrast. Blacks are deep and optimal for enjoying the HDR content. Not too dark if you ensure your settings are optimal and not overdone. Onboard sound is decent. Sounds big enough for the 65\" image. But A large home theater set-up is recommended for enjoying Sound from movies with this TV.\n\nThe only thing I would call a downside is that the overall brightness seems a little inadequate, but only if you are watching a room with too many windows and bright sunlight crossing the path between you and the TV. If you have direct sunlight reflecting off the TV screen then you may not be able to watch anything. But this I believe is a clever trade-off for the price. If you need work with bright rooms then you may want to consider TVs with higher nits of brightness, like the OLEDs from LG, Samsung or Sony. If you can control the room light then I would recommend definitely go for this TV. It's worth every penny.\n\nDolby Vision compatibility would have been a plus on this TV but the premium licensing fees to have one for the brand and also the uncertainty surrounding the future of Dolby vision can be considered as a viable excuse for this feature not being offered on this model. HDR10 with good color gamut will look and appeal well enough for typical 4K and HDR enthusiasts with this TV.",

Drawback i found was the audio quality which is below average to be honest.65inch tv suited for a big living room must have had a better audio quality;16W is not at all sufficient.Better go for a soundbar.Overall a great product.",

            "This is non Baised Review after having this TV for almost 2-3 months.\n\nPros:\nExcellent 4k and Full HD picture quality.\nAudio is clear.\nBig 4k files play just fine without any lag.\nCan be updated to Oreo and Prime Video works just fine after updating to oreo, though you have to sideload it.\nBoth remote works fine, Google assistance is helpful mostly for videos search as it does not support web search.\n\nCons:\nIf your viewing distance is short go for smaller size. Closer you'll sit to tv poorer the viewing angles are so picture gets faded from sides.\n\nHDR10 is worst, normal 4k and FHD video (SDR) plays way brighter and with vibrant colors than HDR videos regardless of online or offline. The picture is just way too dark and dull basically lifeless.\n\nYou'll have to update to Oreo manually since there is no OTA available. Without the update, UI is bit laggy and slow and Prime video does not work on Android 7 either.\nAfter Oreo update there is bit complicated process to make NTFS external drive detected but once that's done TV is great to use.\n\nA lit bit of screen uniformity issue and light bleeding issue, it is only visible in grey screens but usually easy to avoid when watching something in full screen.\n\nFor this price point, this is the best TV you can get period. No other TV provides 10bit panel. If you want Big TV for general day to day use, its no brainer go for it.",

            "BUYER'S REVIEW AFTER 15 DAYS OF USAGE\nI bought the TV during the big billion day sale and have been using it since. Overall the hardware is good for the price, It's the software that needs to be improved.\n- CONS\n* There are a lot of software bugs in the OS, needs an update urgently. I'll mention some of those below\n*The Bluetooth pairing is shoddy doesn't connect to my Blaupunkt soundbar whereas my other tv has no issues\n*The TV doesn't switch on if there's a usb/hd connected to the tv\n*The inbuilt speakers don't turn off when you connect the home theater with the optical audio cable. Sometimes there's no output from the audio jack and needs a restart\n*The buttons on the Bluetooth remote are placed too close to eachother, I end up pressing the netflix button most of the time while going back\n* The sound from the TV's speakers lack depth, can't expect much at this price\n\n- PRO'S\n*VALUE-FOR-MONEY product\n*Good picture quality for the price although the brightness is not that high\n*Decent looks and build quality\n*Plenty of I/O ports hdmi, usb, optical etc\n*Good quality remotes and comes with a wall mount\n\nI HOPE IFFALCON TAKES THIS REVIEW AS A FEEDBACK AND DOES THE NEEDFUL.

            "After 7 months of usage, I can definitely say this is a killer product from a vfm perspective! everything else in this size is exorbitantly and prohibitively priced. my usage is average 2-3 hours a day and for a naked eye the screen quality is highly subjective, but it does the job and does it very well. this review is bit limited as I have switched from DTH to internet content only so Netflix, hotstar and other apps are my primary usage. again a lot depends on your internet Speed and at a good speed this TV is fantastic! hd content looks fabulous and overall no major complaints as such. the air mouse got spoilt but replaced after a bit of followup. I would definitely recommend buying this TV but also wish it remains in top shape for atleast next 4-5 yrs of my ownership!",
            "Working great thus far but its only been a few days. It's definitely a good package at 60K except OLED but who cares, just look at the price difference.\nNot faced any issues mentioned by the others.. brightness is very much there, please study the remote and options. WiFi lagging is because of your poor WiFi connection.\n\nKudos to Flipkart & TCL. The only downside is the extra amount being charged for extended warranty.. now that you have a winning product, why not stand behind it.",
