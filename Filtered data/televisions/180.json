I haven't tried gaming yet so no comments. 4k 60hz isnt my thing though.\n6. overall i would rate it 3/5, would also suggest if you're looking for something good would suggest to stick with the renowned brands like sony or maybe LG.\n\nWill hopefully switch someday to a better brand if I get really frustrated someday as of now I'm trying to adjust :')",
