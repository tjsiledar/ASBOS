I was worried about my TV experience in low budget since I cannot afford LG, SONY and SAMSUNG high end TVs. Now, I can confidently say the picture and sound quality of Thomson TV I have recently bought is awesome. Flipkart delivery is really fast and also demo & installation is too good. TV connectivity is also good. if u think buy new tv then u can definitely go with this Thomson 50 inch TV.",
            "This product is superb & fantastic, very clear picture quality, fast connectivity, even on mobile hotspot its runs smoothly, not hanging after connecting internet. After buing, this product, I realy realised that, on investing this much money, is realy value for money. If guys want to purchase on this amount can go ahead.",
            "Great on Paper but not so in reality. The biggest disappointment this tv gave was with its internet capability. Wifi is unusable. Max 6 Mbps on wifi so forget streaming 4k, even HD is out of reach. Tried ethernet connection and even that was bad. Kept getting 50% of my bandwidth at max while on other tvs reached 100% speed. So if you want this tv for streaming on android os this is not such a good idea. Getting a fire tv stick might help. Its remote is poorly designed. A bulky unresponsive garbage. It connects via bluetooth to the tv and there is no Ir blaster. Sometimes i am unable to turn on the tv. Other times it takes multiple commands on a single press and sometimes none. Sound quality is below average and frankly quite low sometimes. Most audio formats don't get amplified properly. Being an Ips pannel the blacks and contrast is not great although picture quality in bright scenes is good. The android OS has not been properly optimised and customized by thomson. The menu items are sometimes not visible due to the background and are small. Settings optimization is limited for many things like picture and sound quality with just basic options to choose from.\nGet this tv if its similarly priced alternatives are not available.",

It took lot of time to sort the things .\nUnlike normal screencast option we need to connect to same WiFi network and need to cast from there . This means both phone and TV need to connect to same network which means u can't cast with internet from your mobile",

One thing make me disappointed, wall mount is not as good. It's a hanging type wall mount which can easily hang out by children and accidentally.\nThat's all. You can buy it. Experience is awesome.

            "Things that are bang on:\n\nDisplay: Good quality display, good brightness, HDR quality with MEMC technology is an added advantage\nSound: You cannot get better speakers at this price range\n\nThings that need improvement:\nNeed to include a 3.5 mm audio jack\n\nOne thing that needs to be highlighted, whenever we play a video in any app and change the volume or go to \"more options\", the video skips a second, if this can be addressed through a software update then the TV will be 5 on 5",

Thomson is a known European brand relaunched in India. THIS PRODUCT IS VALUE FOR MONEY. At this price one could not find a better product. Picture quality, finish, sound, remote are class apart. I strongly recommend this product to everyone. No one will regret it.",
            "The Thomson tv is great value for money tv.\nThey have cut cost at the correct places.\nThe main component of the tv is display, then sound.\n\nDisplay is very good. The 43 inches model has around 500 NITs of brightness. The 53 inch model has 555 NITs of brightness you can definitely see increase the brightness. For HDR content extra brightness test make a good difference. The sound is decent. It gets little loud, but detail and bass is not very great. Pretty decent sound overall. The panel is supposedly from Samsung.Thats what the customer care representative said but I am not sure. I am pleasantly surprised with the contrast. The static contrast is not mentioned, but in my opinion it's very good.the panel is little reflective but that is something you can pass off in this price range.you could see something nothing in the corners especially if you open YouTube and on the grey background if you see in the corners, it is little dark. But it's not a deal breaker,generally backlighting is good. They don't tell how many local dimming zones are there though. But blooming as pretty much in control.\n\nConnectivity/ram/processor:\nThere are some issues with respect to connectivity.everytime when you start the TV you have to switch on and off the WLAN in the TV menu. Hopefully they fix it quickly with an update. RAM is 1GB and the storage as 8GB. The general interface is little slow but manageable. as a suggestion if you feel the interfaces slow you can always put a Android tv box like mi tv for example and you can fix that.\n\nConclusion:\n\nif you are buying a TV for your parents this is really good option. Overall the display is very good and sound is decent,\nAnd the performance is decent. Design is also good with the thin bezels.it looks very premium. For the price, it's an excellent option, compared to VU, TCL, Nokia.\n\nManufactures , please start mentioning proper tv specs when you release a TV, like color gamut, static contrast, local dimming zones, peak brightness.",

Got call for installation on the same day but I asked them to come the next day. Jeeves did good job with a friendly person guiding the installation.\n\n1. The TV looks good with very thin bazzels... I've been using mi TV so long and this looks much better.\n2. Picture quality is very good with hdr10, dolby vision and memc..\n3. Sound could have been better, I did not feel much bass and I think I should not expect much with a 30w speaker.\n4. Connectivity is good and straightforward... Did not face any issues so far... I've connected my sound bar and works absolutely fine.\n5. Remote is big but has all in it...\n6. This TV is perfect value for money with good display and descent sound... Just short of storage if u wanna store more otherwise I feel this RAM is also sufficient for daily use.",
            "Using the TV for a week now\nWith official Android TV OS and support for Netflix and Amazon Prime and other apps from playstore, a perfect package at a reasonable cost but ... but the hardware specifications such as RAM and Internal Storage are very less as compared to other competitors around there. Only 4gb is available out of 8, so can't keep many apps and games on the TV. Less RAM makes my TV a micromax moment\ud83d\ude13. I liked the metal stand btw. The wall mount is not that great. Bezel less design is fabulous.

Service was good picture quality and sound quality was good in comparison to other brands in same price range was favcing issue in connecting with JIO set top box through wifi, but i thing that was more to do with set top bix then the TV set .

I am providing this feedback after usage of 6 days.\n\nPros:\n1. Picture quality is the best part of the TV with IPS display\n2. Smart features of Android make it an awesome device with good broadband connection\n3. Sound quality is also decent, however one can't compare with Sound Bar or Home Theatre. But, still much better than our old 32\" TV.\n4. Remote of the TV is big in size, however it is quiet useful for starting our Apps like Youtube and Netflix.\n5. Affordable in compare to big brands.\n\nCons:\n1. Have faced WIFI connectivity isuses at times. Will might connect through Ethernet port.\n2. TV has boot time like a Mobile/Laptop. Might be due to low ram and low power consuming slow processor. You may observe its slugginess while switching apps.\n\nOverall, satisfied with this awesome TV.",

After comparing Mi/Vu/Samsung/Lg/Kodak/Sony at micro level FINALLY Thompson was the one who was the clear winner and after making this choice believe me I am very Happy.\nIf you want to see and experience the feel of 4K with in build sound then this is the right choice. Purely 4k and Dolby digital.vision and sound. This feature makes Thompson on above of other products. You won't find this feature at this cost.\nPicture Quality :- Crystal Clear. Search for 4k content and then watch it to see the difference between normal picture content and 4k content. No need to tell anything once you witness it.\nSound:- 30 Wats. Suffice the requirement and no additional sound is required. Other TV in 43inch will have 20/24 Watts speaker.\nConnectivity:- Hassle free and smooth. Everything right from.search to surfing is seamless. No hanging/restarting of app and etc issues are detected so far.\nValue for money :- At this range with all this feature you won't get in other brands.\nI was lucky that I got a good deal as I had opted take this during Flipkart Sale which was from 20th Jan to 24th Jan 21.\nFrom the ment I booked this through Flipkart, everything was hassle free. I got my unit next day. Installation and demo was done within 48 hrs as notified. I am.extremely happy with this piece and Flipkart services.\nJust a suggestion do.opt for extended warranty scheme through Flipkart(jeevs) which is for 3 years at Rs 1920 and it covers up everything for your TV in case if there are any issues.\nGo for it!!! You will love it...",

            "We can't compare this TV with LG or Sony. But it is worth to buy at this price..I have purchased this TV (50\" UHD smart LED TV)with a discounted price of Rs 27,500 and it is worth enough to buy a Smart 4k UHD TV at this price..picture quality and sound is good.\n\nBluetooth and wifi connects very well. Hassle free viewing..\n\nIf you are planning to purchase 50\" UHD Smart LED TV at this price, it is worth to go. More over it is Make in India product..\n\nRe-review after using for 5 months..27th Jan 2021 (Purchased in Aug 2020)\n\nPros :\n\nPicture quality and sound is good\n\nCons:\n1. Issues with remote. Sometimes it works and sometimes it won't. After switching on the TV, you try to increase or decrease volume, it misbehaves and it automatically increase the volume and you won't be able to control. Only option is you need to switch off the TV.\n\n2. Audio and video synchronization issue.. to synchronise Audio and video you need to switch off the TV for some time and need to restart again.\n3. It works well with WiFi. But when you connect it to ethernet, Autoplay will not work..Ex: When you play a video in YouTube with autoplay option, the next video won't play. It keeps on loading..but it works well with WiFi.",
            "Picture quality of the TV is great and the 4k videos plays seamlessly. The TV sound output is also great and installation was smooth, it was done on the next day itself.

Very lightweight and easy transportable.\n\nCons\n1. Startup time is slow. Bootup can take up to 20-25 secs.\n2. Connectivity is slow. Response from bluetooth remote lags from time to time.\n3. Wifi adaptor is 2.4 ghz only, so I would recommend using an Ethernet cable for internet connectivity to watch HD and 4K content.\n\nOverall, for the price, it is a great product.\nWorthy buy ?",

No lags at all.\n\nInstallation is something where you might have to sacrifice for many days as there is no specific time period. It just depends on your luck. I waited for 10 days after delivery. But to avoid getting into this hastle you can simply call Thomson care for installation the moment you receive the product, n trust me that Thomson will make you happy like rocket.\n\nI would love to say that \"I LOVE THOMSON\".\n\nThanks for your time.\nHarsh.",

            "Everything good except NO DOLBY VISION as claimed by company as of now in Android 10.\nHoping they fix this issue soon through an ota update!\nNo lags though this tv supports only 2.4Ghz wi-fi band. Software experience has been good and came with Android 10 out of the box.\nPicture quality especially 4k HDR is excellent. Sound is good once dts-surround sound is enabled.\nBluetooth works fine and pairing is easy.\nCasting works good too.\nOverall excellent value for money but hoping DOLBY VISION support is enabled again by the company through a software update.",

            "searched for all kinds of television. I look for everything was available online sites finally came across this television had great ratings on flipkart read all the reviews which prompted me to buy it but I was still sceptical until I got the delivery. When installation was completed I was amazed at the kind of picture quality and the quality of black colour the depth of image in the overall experience. This is an amazing television for the price that you're getting at this price point!!!! just amazing picture quality, amazing sound and amazing overall Android performance. Even Prime Video works awesome on it, so its just better than Mi TV. I think everyone looking for a TV should definitely go",
            "absolutely best LED 65 inch range\n& 4k is very very nice Indias best led compered other brands.",
            "Overall it's a very good purchase.\n1) Excellent picture quality, one of the best in its class. Black levels are decent and pictures looks crisp and clear.\n2) However, sound is not that loud if you use it in a hall or big rooms. So better get an external music system or a sound bar.\n3) Connectivity is fine and it has all the necessary ports needed.\n4) 100% value for money TV. It does everything that we need. But please don't expect the premium look & finish that you can see it in costlier brands.\n5) Regarding longevity, have to wait and see.. But Thomson providing extended warranty option and I will avail that..",
            "I baught this in Flipkart BBD with a great deal. It's best android tv at this price point. Sound quality is unbelievable, every word of dialogue is crystal clear. 4k & HDR works on wifi, only your net speed needs to be good. Picture quality is also very good. All apps are available to download from Google play. Side loading of apps also possible. Surprisingly it came with Android 10 out of the box whereas I was expecting Android 9. All in all its a great TV at minimal price.",
            "This is one of the best Android TV I have purchased after going lot of research on Flipkart.The best thing which compelled me to buy this tv is the IPS panel which no other brands is offering which makes the picture quality awesome and outperform from other brand. The sound quality is also good and connectivity is also good. There should be no second thought when u purchase a Thompson Android TV.Lastly don't restrict yourself to purchase extended warranty with this TV for added protection. The manufacturer should control the inflation in the price of Thompson TV so that most people purchase this product in reasonable price.",
            "My first impression about this TV is great.\nWhat I liked:\n1) Picture quality is amazing because before purchasing this TV, I have checked LG, Panasonic, Philips and MI TV in the nearby shop. So comparing to these TV's, Thomson TV picture quality is top notch.\n2) Sound output is also great. It is loud enough.\n3) TV user interface and remote buttons are quite good and easy to navigate.\n4) for the price of 25k it is surely a value for money.\n5) TV is very light weight\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n1) I can't connect my laptop wirelessly, like how we cast our mobile.\n2) There is no aux out or HDMI out port (this TV has all input ports). Even there is no RCA out. I use to connect my old TV to home theatre with either of this. But now, the only way i can connect is through digital audio cable and that cable.\n3) Installation was done by jeevs pvt ltd. But the guy who came to install this TV was so pathetic and very rude. He neither gave any demo nor answered to my questions. He was not a trained technician. On top of this, he was asking money to come to our home for installation (but it is written by company that installation of TV is completely free of cost for the first time).\n\nSo for this reason i gave one star less.",

However it's not a big issue, because my second attempt it will work. All in all its very good TV, and it will meet all your needs at this price range. Fantastic product.",

            "After checking all the products decided to buy 50 inch Thomson Tv as it seemed best in it price range . After a week use am satisfied with its performance. Below are my experiences,\n\nDisplay:\n500 nits does show in reality, you can feel the picture is bright in good way . 4K videos are fun to watch - overall very satisfied.\n\nI moved from SONY so hangover from it is still there , it's true that no other can beat the clarity of sony but its worth it for this price.\n\nStreaming:\nI heard in one the review that it's a single band wifi and it's does stream good. But to me it's working fine . Am using jio wifi device and not in any city but still it's able to stream 4k fine , if multiple devices are connected it buffers slightly.\n\nSound:\n30w it sounds good ,,but it's lacks the clarity and bass which I got in sony 24W. Manual user setting of bass to 100 did make it sound better , but may be am still in hangover with sony , will correct this review after a month of usage .\n\n\nOverall definitely worth smart tv at 30k .",

Start up is little bit slow but ok. 4k clarity is great. Picture mod vivid is perfect. Others are not good enough.\nThe brightness of the tv is ok but not good enough...\nThis time I am little bit disappointed with flipkart as I got an opened tv even I bought 3 year extra warranty. The pannel screw s are not fitted correct. And a slight alignment difference between the display and the plastic parts.\nBut I didn't go for the claim as it works fine for me.\nTv is great at this cost...",
            "Well i read some really good reviews and bought the TV. After using for a day i am very delighted with my purchase. Its really value for money. Good discount during BBD.\n\nPros: 55 inch tv has Good quality screen, hight brightness, colors are also excellent. Bezels are very thin, TV looks very glam. Golden line at the bottom adds to its looks. Remote is excellent.\n\nCons: Speakers are just OK. May be ok for normal watching but a sound bar adds lot of value. Single band wifi is also a point but on my network of airtel at 200 mbps it works fine.\n\nImp note: TV came with older software, i saw many quality issue on tv screen, but then i updated software which was available the TV quality improved drastically. Company should consider preloading that update.However updating by yourself is also not a challenge its very simple. Go in settings and look for software update same like mobile phone updates.\n\nOverall: I am very satisfied with this TV. Great product at very reasonable price.",
            "After comparing many TVs and reviews, decided to go for this TV. Really delighted that it fulfilled our expectation. Picture and Sound quality is awesome.

Menu option in the right corner without occupying much screen space is a good feature, enables us to chagne settings without loosing the scenes.",

So far good.\n\nPros\n1) Good Display\n2) TV doesn't hang and quite Fast\n3) Android 10 Update available immediately.\n\nCons\n1) Average/Below Average sound quality. Volume is just loud but not good or clear. (In this price range cannot expect something more).\n2) Visuals are too bright at times. The brightness factor might cause some kinda discomfort for ardent movie watchers.\n3) Not a sturdy wall mount material.",

            "After lot of market research on TVs, Thomson TV stood 1st on my mind. Coz Thomson is not a new brand its a french brand and their legacy still continue in Europe. In India Flipkart is dealing this TV brand. Its been three months Iam having this TV. What can i say its simply superb in all aspects. Amazing picture quality. Sound and networking on par with many costly braned TVs. Price is very reasonable compare to all Japanese and Korian brands. Last but not least this TV completely made in India.

Finally figured that it's port 1.\n2. Worst part is you can't connect to 5g band, you can connect only to 2.4g.\n3. picture is not clear when backlight is at 100%.\n4. Sometimes audio is not coming, had to off n on to get sound back.\n\nApart from above issues, it's definitely worth and you would love the experience.\n\nNote: Installation guys are not so professional, I didn't have good experience with installation process.",

The first TV which I received had some discoloration - visible if you watch sports a lot e.g. cricket or football. I raised a complaint, Jeeves handled the call, checked the TV and confirmed the replacement and replacement was done in about a week. I am very satisfied on how this was handled seamlessly both from Flipkart as well as from Thomson India, though I did have to check twice on the status of my complaint ticket with Flipkart.\n\nComing to the TV itself, I changed from a CRT TV so I am no expert on the color reproduction accuracy but the screen is very clear even from about 15-20 feet away and sound is quite loud and clear even at low volumes , I haven't felt a need for a sound bar. The interfaces provided are contemporary and the Google Assistant is a boon, we don't feel a need to operate any other key !!\n\nOverall, I think it is a great product at this price point (now with even lower price ).",

Programs/settings navigation is easier (as it is android). I did not find any software issues as of now. I am yet to explore other connectivity (like soundbar, arc etc).\n\nWrt build, no rough use please! as the display panel is just placed without any edge protections (and not sure if this is the case in all other modern TVs), otherwise backcover is strong. Wallmount is preferable.",

Picture quality is literally awesome thanks to Flipkart and Thomson for bringing out these kind of TVs in an affordable price. You can experience 4K atmosphere in your living room.

Must be broadband issue.\nBluetooth connectivity works just fine.\nHDMI CABLE & ARC works absolutely fine.\nRemote is very detailed & helpful.\nScreen mirroring/cast does show lag a bit which can be improved.\nThe sound is enough for a hall of 20*15.\nI faced issues with Google Assistant. But as informed by the Thomson suport team, I had to painfully do a factory reset & then it works again like a charm.\nOverall - WORTH EVERY PENNY SPENT ON IT.",
            "After 4 months of usage\nWhat i Like:\n- Good & Bright display\n- Pretty decent audio quality - Loud & Clear\n- Checked compatability - Dolby Audio, HDR - Works with notification on top\n- Apps compatability with 4K - Prime Video,\n- Netflix not checked yet, but should support 4K. But unknown about Dolby Vision.\n- Chromecast works good for streaming apps like Youtube, Primevideo, prime music, Spotify\n- Using a pendrive as an internal shared storage, works well for storing offline content\n- Updated to Android 10!!\n\nWhat could be better\n- Chromecast with apps like MX player, VLC doesn;t work well, huge lag or struggles to play the content stored in mobile to TV\n\nWhat I don't like\nDon't expect pure black in the panel, there are few light leak while the screen in dark or black scene. Easily noticeable when ur room is dark and playing title card with black background and text only.\nBut u cant obseve them in bright light condition.\n\nAlso the Thomson customer care guy calls and asks to give 5 star rating for an extended 3 months warranty. I don't like this strategy.",
            "Overall the TV is very good in terms of Picture and Sound quality... But the image shows gold color panel in the flipkart app but the actual product his silver color. Next the wall mount given along with the TV does not solve any purpose. Once you wall mount the TV with the mount given along with the TV you will lose access to the connectivity ports given behind the TV. Your hands can't leave reach the USB or HDMI ports for any connectivity...\n\nApart from that the TV is very good...",

Audio\nDTS, DOLBY enabled.\n30W speaker output delivers crystal clear sound.\n\n4.Connectivity\n\nChromecast enabled and it works well.\neARC HDMI and optical output available so can connect soundbar to enjoy HD audio.\nBluetooth 5.0\n\nCons\n\n1.Dual band wifi is missing though we can stream 4k videos.\n2. Boot time - initial boot time requires atleast 10 secs.\n3. WCG is missing.\n\nOverall its a best buy for this price range.\n\nSame price range kodak also offers the same features.

There are not many customisation available for this television like custom brightness, sound equaliser etc. One issue observed was with the remote, where it stopped working after 2 months. I had to initiate a support request, make a video to prove that it is not working and had to courier the remote to Delhi on my expense since there was no support person available to visit home and do this. Feedback time from the support team is 2 to 3 days for each mail and after couple of follow ups I got the new working remote. Support team provided alternate option with a mobile application to control television in the meantime.",

On trying to contact Thomson customer care, they do not have information about the stock availability of TV. HDMI socket and all other sockets should be reachable. They are given to much inside.",
            "I have been using this TV for 2 months, I got feel like it awesome, the connectivity is good and the picture quality is also good, I didn't expect so much but I terribly happy with this product.",
            "1st of all i want to remembered that few people are know that it's a 120 years old Company. It has a a great achievement thats also a big reason why I purchased.\nAbout the T.V:-\n(1) Sound quality is superb.\n(2) Picture quality is also super-duper.(note:- If you purchase a big screen size then I suggest you to connect the HD Cabel and also HD Channels.)\n(3) Connectivity is also nice and fast capturing, not any issue with connectivity\n(4) most important thing that money, I didn't believe that i would get such a 43' size smart T.V at such a low price with nice features. So if your budget is low then go ahead for this blindly.\nOverall I want to say that it is a super-duper Smart T.V comparison with also MI and REALME with a best price and best features.",
            "First of all received damaged product due to white patches appeared and claimed for replacement and omnitech retailer proceeded for refund and i refused to get the refund because the omnitech seller misguided the replacement policy, even they had available stock they raised for refund. After subsequent communication i got the replacement because i got 43 inch at 20600 through big billion deal.\n\n\nThis is the only TV at value for money in the 4K segment.\nPicture quality is good even at standard dth connection through AV input .HDMI will be better than AV. Stunning 4K videos. No Connectivity issue found. Chrome cast working fine. No buffering even the network speed low, the videos are continuously playing and faster than android phone. Dolby vision provides the colour enhancement to give crystal clear picture. Dolby digital and Dts trusurrond make the vocal and treble clear. Sound is enough for mid size hall by 30 watts speaker. If you expecting the bass on audio by connecting a 5.1 home theatre along with thomson tv will be the perfect match to experience the cinematic view. Bluetooth connectivity performs well. Pretty bezel less design and bottom stand golden metallic frame at the bottom with brand name make the TV looks premium even the TV in off condition. Dont waste money in branded sony samsung sets. Dont worry Go ahead.",
            "Brilliant picture and sound quality (Works best with HD & above content with Dolby Audio). It has good connectivity to pair devices. Value for money product.

So I'm not entirely sure the quality of picture is expected to be this good or is it actually Thomson TV making such a fantastic impression. Nonetheless, I'm extremely satisfied with the picture quality, sound and connectivity. The delivery and installation from Flipkart exceeded expectation after two back to back horrible experience, not sure if it was the 3yrs extended warranty I purchased this time that made the difference. I'm hopeful this product does keep up with good rating it's been getting. It was difficult to choose between this TV and MI, but I'm happy that I selected Thomson. We used it for 15 years in the past (non-smart CRT model) and the sound and build quality was fascinating then and same now. Keep it up \ud83d\udc4d",

            "Generally I don't write reviews, but this excellent product compelled me to write one. I moved to new place so I sold my last 55 inch tv and got Thompson 55 inch. My last smart TV was of famous brand, with features like 700 nits of brightness, 240 Hertz refresh rate, 55 local dimming zones and double the cost compare to Thompson. But if I compare both hardly there is any difference, so my point is if you don't care for band then this tv is perfect for you. Give this TV HD input and it will not disappoint you.

Sound quality is ok for watching YouTube serials but for music and movies you need a good sound system or a soundbar for the bass\n3. Built in wifi is only 2.4ghz which is a bummer as it is mostly sufficient but 5ghz would have been better buffer times are present but not too concerned about it\n4. No headphone jack is a very big hit as the only other option to add sound equipment is the optical in port or bluetooth\n5. I didn't receive any extra accessories like hdmi cable, screws for the wall mount and spacers for the tv which is not a good thing\n6. MEMC is just a gimmick it doesn't work at all and if it is there i can't find it\n7.

Every time, the electricity was out, and then on switching on, i had to reconnect to wifi from settings, else YouTube, Prime etc doesnt work. Surprisingly Netflix works without reconnecting which shows no issues with internet/wifi router at home. Anyways getting Ethernet Lan cable solved my issue.\nNext came to the TV remote. It stopped working. Ofcourse i thought it was just the battery and purchased new. But unfortunately it wasnt the issue. I wrote to the customer care who transferred the case to their Spares division. I was \"demanded\" for a video of the TV remote not working, so they could initiate it to be shipped to your location. I thought it was straight forward. After sending the video, the Spares department stopped responding to my email follow up. You guessed it right, i still haven't got the TV remote or any calls from the Spares team for a replacement. I lost hope, so back on Flipkart trying to find a compatible remote to meet my needs.\nOn the positive note, i love the TV, its price and the clarity it has to offer. Now waiting to see what other surprises come my way!",

Installation done immediately after one day of product receipt. Flipkart delivery is bang on.\n\nAfter so many reviews and comparison i had taken decision to go ahead with thomson. As am aware that thomson name is well known during my child hood, then now entered into smart TV catigory.\n\nI trust have taken best decision and enjoying the TV now. I usually watch youtube and local HD set top box. Internet connectivity is also good there is no lag in video streaming as long as your signal strength is good. So far i had not faced any issues. Mirror screening also pretty good.\n\nI had faced only issue is google assistance is not functioning post setting up the chrome cast. Have asked company representative to visit once. awaiting for that or else am very much satisfied with this budget TV. Thanks to Thomson and also big thank to Flipkart for customer Oriented Activities.",

            "Hi guys...my old tv stopped working in early days of lockdown...since then i was planning to buy one tv...but atlast i waited for BB days and got this wonderful 43\" Thomson oathpro TV which i had wishlisted since its launched. Orginal price was 24999 but got a very good deal in BB at only 21599/-\n\nGot delivered one day before estimated time. Installation on same day in late evening with very professional work.\n\nPicture and sound quality is much much better than expected.\n\nConnectivity is good... though i had to purchased one extender because my router is placed very far from the tv and loses its access and on the extender it gives very good non stop picture quality...quite happy about it.\n\nRemote is fast.\n\n--Cannot connect to home theatre via AV and aux cable and can connect only with BT....as my Home theater is very old without bluetooth. So i purchased one blutooth adapter and got connected to my HT. Only thing is bluetooth adapter does not connect automatically everytime (may be BT adapter fault). But tv speaker sound is so good that at a time u will no need home theatre.\n\nOne thing i m unhappy about is that in some apps like Prime, mxTV and sometimes in hotstar when i do fwd and backward in videos...it behaves abnormally and than i had to exit that video as well as apps to resume normally thats irritating and no such abnormality found in NETFLIX app it works like charm.\n\nBut in all i got a very good deal and very good tv.\n\nEven in 25k it is better and u can\n\nGo for it.",

Company has given 1.5 yrs warrenty including 6 months additional warranty.After usage of 11 months observed a line on top of the screen. Initially I thought it is a minor. After a lapse of 1 month I observed that the length of the line is getting increased. Then I took a snap and sent to Thomson customer support by mail. No responce. Then I have contacted customer support by phone call. They have informed that it's a screen problem and TV has to be replaced by additional payment of 80% of the present cost of TV. Then I have questioned about the warranty. They have informed that warranty will not cover the picture problem. So, I am advising all not to purchase this TV as there is no proper service. It is advisable to go for a branded TV even more cost also bcz it will give longer life and good customer service. The customer service is very very poor.",

            "Wrting this detailed review after one-week of usage.\nI was confused with Nokia, Motorola and Thomson Tv. After a lot of comparison, I decided to go with Thomson. Before purchasing my main concerns on this TV was on 1.75 GB ram and Singke band WIFI.\nBut during my one week usage I found no lag in streaming 4K videos in youtube, Netflix and Prime videos. No connectivity issues on 2.4 GHz wifi also.\nThough it is Android 9, on the day of installation itself I received an update to Android 10.\nPros\nPicture Quality - Excellent\nSound Quality - Very Good with 30W sound for 17 x 20 living room\nConnectivity - Excellent\nDelivery and Installation - Very Good\nOS - ANDROID 10\nLook - Premium look with basel less design\nUser-friendly remote with google assistant.\n\nCons\nVery light wall mount stand which I resolved in just Rs.600/-\n\nOverall good Indian product backed with French legacy at a very reasonable price. I got the deal for 25k for 55 inch TV on Diwali sale and I opted this TV with a three-year complete protection plan.\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDING THIS PRODUCT who need a quality tv at a very good price.\n\nThanks Flipkart for fast and prompt delivery and Thank you Thomson for your wonderful product with very good packaging.",

Audio is seriously good for casual viewing experience but for movies simple sound bar should help.\n6. IPS instead VA is always good to have.\nCon\nYes in 2020 wifi support only 2.4 hz ?

You will be immensely satisfied with few savings on your name :)\n\nCheers",

It was 25k previously, however in October 2020 big billion days I got it at Rs 19,800. Also I took insurance for TV it may be better these days.

I have looked it's picture quality it is great and it's sound quality it normal not equal to HD sound, however it's ok whereas it is low budget TV. It's connectivity is good. I have connected my Sony 5.1 channel bluetooth home theatre, now it's output is best. The TV design is very nice and bottom legs are very fency golden colour. It have sufficient HDMI ports and USB ports. So finally I give 4.8 Stars.

I didn't face any issues with connectivity, like a lot of people had mentioned. Chromecast works smoothly. I think if you have a router with good range then you won't have any issues with Wifi also.\n\n3. Connected it to my tataSky and picture quality is super awesome. Though you would need an HDMI cable which is not included. Standard blue and yellow AV cables don't give that-good quality.\n\n4. Also performance is more than enough for my usage. I just watch on tatasky and few other apps.\n\n5. Storage could be less for someone who wants a lot of apps.\n\nCons:\n\n1. I felt that the wall mount that came with the TV was not up to the mark. It was just a single rod. It was decent enough but I didn't feel that it could last for 4-6 years. So I bought a TV mount from the installation guy for 1600.\n\n2. Start up time is a little long about 25-30 seconds.\n\nP.S. Images are all taken from 4k videos.",

I was chasing for most economic and trusted TV in this segment and succeed in Big billion days, I see soon this size is now out of stock. Can understand the popularity. If you see, no TV in offline or online purchase has always positive remarks. All TVs shall have some life and you've to live with that.\n\n\n1. This has almost all features what we look for\n2. If you ask for 8k, 5GHZ wifi support, then its not there\n3. Sound quality is really soothing\n4. It gets connected to my 100mbps broadband (not a optic fiber) connection (actual 40-50mbps) very easily. IF your TV doesn't get connected, runs slow then dont blame the TV blame your internet speed\n5. If you are going for 55, 65 inch tV then I guess extended warranty is must. Value looks very high but i think these TVs last for 2-3 year smoothly then start giving you some issues, so better be safe and check for repair service they charge you very high. I've opted for it for three years\n6. Google inbuilt voice assistant works smooth\n7. With all Netflix, Prime, hotstar, YouTube platforms pre installed I'm not liking HD channel on DTH\n8. So I think I 'll be spending on all these subscription too\n9. I couldn't mirror my phone yet, shall try again\n10.\n\nI strongly recommend to all who loves big screen then go for it 55, 65,75 even if you've a small room.",

Doesn't require you to use any FireStick or external streaming devices.\n- Android 9 OS that allows all the play store apps and also side loading of apps\n- 30W sound output is loud enough for a large living room\n- In built Chromecast works great\n- Good connectivity options\n- Very easy to install and use. Installation service provided by Flipkart was quick and good.\n\nCons:\n- Very slow boot time (takes more than 20-30 seconds)\n- Very low internal storage\n- The operating system is slow due to less powerful processor and less RAM but apps run fine.\n- Google Assistant is slow in responding\n- Although the sound is loud enough to listen to the music, you will find it difficult to hear dialogs clearly if the room is very large. Requires sound bar to be installed in such cases.\n- Customer care is very slow in responding. Requires multiple follow ups.\n- Product description claims that the TV supports AirPlay for ios devices. There is no inbuilt support. You need to download 3rd party Airscreen app from playstore to use Airplay. Advanced features for this app are Paid features.\n\nOverall review - It is a great 4k TV to buy in this price range. Do not expect it to be similar to high range premium TVs.",

Reviewing based on my experience in the last two days.\n\nVideo quality is good it tried all the resolution up till 4k\nAudio is loud enough but while watching movies, some time sound is too loud especially during songs and action sequences. This is irrespective of whether you are in the movie more or music mode.\nInstallation was done on the promised date but the service person changed the time thrice and was pushing to buy a stabilizer, though it was not required as per the Thompson contact.\nWifi doest support dual-band (5Ghz) and I don't have an issue, because TV is located close to the router and it is connected via ethernet cable.\nThe Remote is very handy with separate buttons for youtube and Prime video which I use most of the time and sensors are good enough( I tried at 25 feet distance from the TV).\n\nTo summarize, This TV solves the basic needs of home TV for its price, need to wait for long time performance and post-sales service feedback.\n\nI'm rating this 4 star since I couldn't conclude, it is the best in the market. There are other TV's of the same price or lesser, solves the purpose. I'm satisfied overall.",

Dolby Audio\n..\n..\nMany more.\n\nI am using this TV for last 10 days, and the sound quality is awesome (although I already had a 4.1 sound system, but I removed that after hearing its sound quality.) The picture quality is the best in 4k. Moreover, surprisingly, when I played HD (720) content, the up-scaling of resolution worked like a Charm and I never felt it is HD content that I am seeing. No pixelation, etc.\n\nThe service Engineer fitted it on the same day, So good service Expectation.\nHighly recommended.",

Sound- Its awesome. Never heard such marvelous sound from a LED TV. Some songs and movies can be played at soud level 10-15. When you increase the sound above 50, your neighbors will dance.\n3. Speed - Little slow in starting. It may be due to booting of the android system. Rest operating is fine. Connecting mobile with chromecast is good. When connected with Laptop via HDMI, screen was blinking. When connected laptop via chrome cast, few microsecond lag is there. I do not know if it is normal of all TVs.\n4.

            "I bought a 50 inch TV for Rs 29000 and got it delivered two days before Vinayak Chathurthi. Next day, installation was done. It was raining hard on the day it was delivered the box became wet on one side and lyckily didn't damage TV. Flipkart needs to take good care of the items when delivering.\nThe picture quality looks good, sound is great and the remote is great, too. The remote is a bluetooth one so it can be used in any direction within certain distance from TV. TV comes with preinstalled apps such as prime, netflix, youtube etc., and you can install many apps from google play store.\nI placed order for this TV (French technology, made in India) as I didn't want to spend a lot of money on most popular Korean and Japanese brands. Technology changes rapidly and the value depreciates too fast. Honestly, I was looking for a VU TV, but no stock anywhere and went for this TV. So far so good with the decision.\nA few things that are of concern to me are:\n1. It only has 1.75 GB RAM and 8 GB of storage.\n2. It only has single band wifi (2.4 GHz). Having two band wifi helps playing 4k videos seamlessly. Whenever you connect to the smart features, you need to disconnect and connect to wifi manually. This is really annoying. You don't need to enter password, but disconnect and connect again.\n\nAbout insrallation guy from jeeves:\nHe, Sampath Kumar, was horrible. He just came to install it and didn't explain anything neither about the remote nor about the TV. He didn't check any ports, if they were working fine. He came in the evening maybe tired, but it is his job to spend time with the clients to explain everything to the extent possible. Customer service should be top most priority in any business.\nThere is a free wall mount in the box, if you wanna mount it on a wall.\nSoon after you buy the TV, you will get a call from the manufacturer of the TV for a screenshot of your review to get an additional warranty of 3 months. This is kind of luring customers to give a good review, I presume. That call didn't change my mind.",
            "While running the tv suddenly the picture gets blinking for every few minutes. I never expect this type of products from flipkart or thomson y u r doing this type of mistakes for customers i can't understand.

Connected a sound bar separately using optic cable (purchased separately). Blue tooth connectivity to cordless head phones a very big plus point. Remote is easy to use with dedicated buttons for Netflix and Utube. TV resolution excellent and a good sound output. For a theatrical effect though, connection to home theatre or sound bar desirable.

Rest two hdmi ports can handle only 8bpc\nAt 4k 60hz refresh rate which is a little disappointing but at this price u cant argue.\n\nIt\u2019s a pretty decent buy for gaming purposes.
