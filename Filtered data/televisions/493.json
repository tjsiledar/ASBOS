            "Wonderful TV, same day installation, clear and powerful sound. I am using hd set top box..... And can not differentiate that it is HD ready TV.... It's performance is like FHD TV.",
            "First of all i would like to appreciate Flipkart for their delivery service with their partner Gati Courier Services.\nOnly Flipkart is able to deliver large appliances products to several areas here in Uttar Pradesh. Full marks on this.\nProduct delivered early than promised date and with absolute care.\nComing to TV it's excellent , LG has made name for their panels. You can get same type of TV from VU and Micromax at lower price but than again when it comes to reliability and brand value i would stuck with LG, Samsung and won't mind paying extra premium.\nIt's the new 2017 model having 2 HDMI ,1 USB ports and all are easily accessible. Satisfied with the panel as it served my purpose.\nInstallation was done by Jeeves provided free by Flipkart. Installation was done in quick time and engineers were very polite.\nGood job Flipkart and OmniTechRetail \ud83d\udc4d",
            "Excellent led tv provided by flip cart with best price of 15499/- unbeatable.\nTv is very good in this price with great picture quality. I say only one word overall\"amazing\"",
            "Purchased the product looking after review in Flip kart. Guys please do not show interest better to buy at LG or other Stores.\nCustomers will leave hope on Flip kart if delivers a product like this and has to concentrate more of product quality not on delivery time.\n\nCompared the same LG product (different model with same features which i brought in store) lot's of difference in product quality\n\n2 Star for Screen Display,Noticed the white Lines and black lines\n1 Star for Product Quality.\n0 Star for Sound System.U feel as if you hearing the running FM Radio in Traffic.\n5 Star for Flip-kart Delivery in time and Installation by LG executive.\n\nPlease do not show intrest in buying this product.",

            "I purchased a new LG TV. Product is very Nice. Delivery also Super fast, Flipkart working Very Nice and Installation work also Good\n\nI m Satisfied..\n\nThank u Flipkart..\nThank you Jeeves consumer service private limited for Fast installing.",
            "the 5* rating is for flipkart. tv delivered in two days as promised, installation done on same day, a day before the assured date. Well done flipkart!!!\n\nNow regarding the tv, i just had a day of watching...so this review is based on that.\n\npros:\n1. Picture quality is good only for HD channels, SD channels not so good. when i played HD videos thru USB (1TB hard disc) it played smoothly, no lag, awesome clarity. The colors are as good as what you see in naked eye. Even the videos of my 5mp cellphone camera look better than what it looks in my phone or PC.\n2. Sound is good, not great but you wont complain. i played some mp3 songs and the sound is really superb.\n3. The wall mount provided by flipkart (free) is adjustable, so no problem in accessing the ports which are all in the back of the tv.\n4. This is a 2017 model, so better to buy this rather than old 2015 models of samsung (in the same price range around 20k) where the sound is also not good.\n5. the Jeeves installation partner also provides 1 (tv) + 2 years of extended warranty at 1900 that is optional.\n\ncons:\nThis tv has FM radio, but the signal is really really poor in a metro like chennai , so definitely it wont be good for non-metros. One of the reasons i preferred this tv was the FM radio but i m disappointed.\n\nSo far so good, will review it again maybe after a couple of months.",

Playing Full HD videos shows its capabilities.\nFM radio will play fine if you put antenna at right places.\nNote:\n1. For best sound quality , you should have good sound system.\n2. Airtel TV, TATA sky or Dish TV are recommended companion . Local cable connection doesn't match your expectations",
            "Picture clarity is awasome.. Got it for 14.4 K..Sound quality also superb but bass is bit low... It plays almost every format through Harddisk..Over all fantastic deal.. Go for it.. Lve u LG",
            "Decent TV. Above average perfirmance, Worth the pricing @ 175499. If you are looking for plain valina TV, without any so called 'smart' features, Go for it.\nExcellent support from seller QRS and flipcart.",
            "Flipkart commited for two days but delivered and installation completed in one day. LG with this much starting price Rs.18999 is a great deal. Product clarity sound excellent at this budget. It comes with wall mount free. Installation free .Recommended with 5 star.",
            "LG is very good product using from more than one month it's a very good product picture clarity is also very nice with IPS panel and loud sound quality with surround system. the speaker is given in this tv is very good performing. highly recommended to go this product...\n\nThe delivery is also very fast by flip-cart got this product before given on schedule date. and the same day got installation with jeevs service provider. here i can say Thanks to all, and slightly got despondent with TV border colour is silver type and not accepted as slim if the colour is black and slim then the product looks will be very good. Once again Thanks flipcart.\n\nThanks and Regards,\n\nPrabhakar Desai",
            "Great choice which offers great performance at this price range. I bought it at 18799. No extra charges. Service engineer from LG has done the free installation next day. He provided wall mount (no additional cost).\nI prefer buying known and reputed brand to avoid hassles in future, So LG is my first preference in TV. Here's I rated this TV:\nSound: 10/10\nPicture: 9/10\nConnectivity: 8/10\nEasy of use: 8/10\nBuild quality: 9/10\nLook and feel: 10/10\nThough it is not a smart TV, we can connect Chromecast or Fire stick and make it completely smart :)\nI am Happy Customer!!",
            "Excellent product.! Worth buying. Prompt delivery from Flipkart (packing could have been even better). Do not hesitate to buy this product and amazing prizing from Flipkart, thanks for that... Ultimately, a must buy product in HD ready TV segment.",
            "This product is not full HD TV but they looks likes HD TV. Sound quality is very good, picture quality is good, screen size is 32\" and other body and parts is very good . There are no other connectivity sources like wifi, bluetooth, internet, and other feature. It has only usb port, hdmi port, FM . This is a simple HD TV. You can buy this item",
            "Good product. But i face 2 problems\n1 demo person do not format of usb drive.\n2. This led has divx format so youtube video firstly downloaded then convert in divx format' very time consuming .\nFLIPKART support is good. Pl strong your technical team of lg service",
            "First of all I thank to flipkart for giving offer during big billion day.. I brought this product for 15.5k..Y I rated as 4 is reason is due to late delivery.. I got this product after 14days of booking date.. Rest of the things are Good. Valuable for Money..",
            "Good picture quality..,Excellent LG customer support for installation and demo. Checked with LG care about online warranty support after I had been placed the order. Sound awesome and clear output..Really worth for money (Bought on offer 18K)",
            "product worth the price. good picture quality. sound clarity is also good. only thing I see as a con is that the input parts are behind the television which makes it difficult when we fix it on the wall or we must use a moving stand on the wall which they didn't have.",
            "Good product. Good and fast service . Very competitive price. Fantastic experience. Always recommend",
            "The delivery speed of the TV from Flipkart was amazing. Order was placed the previous night and delivery happened the next day morning.\n\nBut what\u2019s the use of this super fast delivery if the installation date is 2 days or so later and no visibility of the progress?\n\nInstallation of a TV is no big deal especially if there is no wall mounting involved. However I was told that the warranty is void if I do it myself.\n\nIt\u2019s 2 days since delivery. But till today, I have not received any information when the installation will happen. My time for the last 2 days and until installation is hijacked as I have to wait at home for the installation. This is not good.",
            "value for money i have purchased TV 2 months before and still date no any issue.\nafter TV purchased within 2 days I got delivery and very good support from flipkart for installation.\nbelieve flipkart is very good as compared Amazon.",

            "tv looks are great . But best recommended to view only with dish TV . do not view with ordinary cable service provider. USB movies looks awesome. sound is cinema mode is excellent.Tv looks classy .",

            "Service from Flipkart was worst. Ordered the product on 15th Oct and got it delivered on 16th Oct. Installation was promised to be completed on or before 18th Oct. But still did not receive any call from authorized agent on installation.\n\nReached out to Flipkart customer care, but no proper response. They are just extending the ETA of installation by just saying that it will be done in 2 days.\n\nPlanning to return it back as no one is properly responding. Not willing to give a single star as well for Flipkart services.",
