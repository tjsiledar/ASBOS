If u are using just as a normal led tv than its good but if u wishes to use pendrives or home theatre with this tv then u will not satisfied as this tv does not run most of the video format throught USB port and does not have any facility to connect the home theatre. The picture quality is very good and audio quality is also godd and useful for those who only wishes to watch TV either with Cable connection or set top box.",
            "Hi,\n\nReceived & completely demo installation within 2 days from the date of Order. Thanks to Flipkart.\n\nThe product is value for money. I have downloaded FULL HD video songs from youtube & played it via USB. It's amazing picture quality and can be compared to FULL HD Televisions. Sound quality is not so bad. Remote is not standard compared to Sony & other brands but doesn't matter.\n\nFinally to keep in mind is high picture quality depends on HD channels, blue ray dvds, HD videos..etc. These works better even with HD ready channels also.\n\nIf you are planning to buy this product then just close your eyes and can go ahead.",

            "This is my third day since I've been using this TV. It's nice, affordable and a wise buy who has a tight budget. Picture is excellent, sountd is prettey good if not excellent. Viewing angles are acceptable. Remote is confusing, as many other reviewers mentioned, but has powerful sensor. In other words, it's a very good basic LED TV.",
            "I have bought Panasonic LED TV about six months back and I am very satisfied with the product. Sound output and picture quality is excellent. Panasonic product is reasonably priced compared to other major Korean brands. Need less to say Flipkart delivery was on time and installation process went smoothly. Will strongly recommend this product.",

            "It has been 12 days since the tv was delivered. Its better than most of the other telvisions in the 32 inch range. It is better than LG, Samsung and others in terms of sound, design and picture quality, supporting almost all HD quality movies, even the 1080p ones. I will say that sony gives a far better product than this tv. Which includes picture clarity and quality and sound also. But considering sony's price and my usage (generally we use tv for tata sky); this panasonic tv is worth it. Also panasonic offers on site warranty and extended free warranty which was an important factor for me buying this tv.",

            "Product Delivery\n\nFlipkart has done excellent job as usual. They had delivered the product in the communicated time frame.\n\nInstallation and Service\n\nService Engineer from Panasonic was ready much before the delivery. I had to stop him as the delivery was not happened that time. I called him soon after the delivery and he came to my place with in an hour time. He has installed the TV and explained us the basic functionalities.\n\nProduct\n\nPros.\n\nGood Product in this price range. The important quality of this brand is its Picture quality. I felt far better than other brands in this price range. As of now no other problems.\n\nCons.\n\nSound quality is ok. But enough for normal family.\n\nYet to explore more feature.\n\nRegards,\nNimeesh Ramakrishnan",
            "Positives\n1. IPS panel. Excellent and vibrant picture quality, better than my LG 32\" full HD LCD TV.\n2. Affordable price. Got it at Rs.16.5k. So why to buy LG/Samsung/Sony at 5-10k higher or why to buy other unestablished brands at the same rate or few grands cheaper.\n3. Good design\n\nNegatives\n1. Confusing remote. Who cares. Once you adjust the parameters, do you need a remote any more.\n\nGo ahead with this if you want to buy a 32\" LED TV",
            "Well to be honest Best LED TV in 20k. I have Sony bravia 32inch led with me. I compared both really this Panasonic led TV is better then Sony.in picture quality.But sound quality not upto mark. But its excellent TV in the price range guys just go for it.",

May be I have to do some research on manual settings. Free wall-mount received but not used as it don't have extending arm, thus spend another Rs.700 to get it from other store.",
            "Writing this review after 3 months of using the TV. The delivery was on time. The installation was also done quickly. The TV is operating as expected. Picture clarity is good and so is the sound quality. This is a value for money product.\n\n8-June-2017:\nI bought an anycast device and the TV works like a charm. Now I am able to view YouTube videos and movies on my TV through my smartphone. Thus the HDMI port and the USB port are also tested and working perfectly.",

            "First when purchasing it ..Not good items But after exchange it good luck with Great items so tx",

            "It was good product and Panasonic brand. Out side market it's cost is 18k. I purchased in Flipkart 16k. But discount given due to it was 2015 model, any way according to brand like Panasonic it was better product. Good for budget planning people.",
            "I just love this Panasonic brand Awesome product best picture quality and sound quality happy to buying from Flipkart, Flipkart made my festival very special.",

            "Very good tv. Wonderful picture quality. Enjoying watching this tv. Even SD channels are displayed with high clarity. Wall mount it on the wall. There is enough gap between the wall and the tv, so inserting pendentive or HDMI cable is not a problem like other TVs.\n\nFlipkart delivery and service is awesome. They called me and asked whether my tv was installed properly or not. Go and purchase this tv from flipkart without any hesitation.",
            "Extremely happy with the TV.. Crisp FHD like picture..good sound quality..sleek looks...value for money. Flipkart services were awesome delivered dot on date..service engineer came on the 3rd day and the TV was on.",
            "Very nice deal bought it on Freedom Sale offer. Wow! deal I booked this tv just for 16470/- which was very cheap compared to any other website or outlets. Now TV is working very good and clarity is awesome in SD channels itself. Desparatly Waiting for the next deal. Hatsoff!! flipkart!!!!",
            "Best Expreience FoR a LED Tv.. Installation is fast even if you are in a remote city.. Tv is awesome with full hd.. 32 inch",
            "Flipkart delivered this in no time. Installation was smooth and happened in 2 days only. TV quality is good. It took almost 1 month to select a LED TV and i am happy with the decision i made. Definitely will recommend this TV.",
            "one day delivery and installation with demo is done by flipkart and panasonic. I am very happy with service. Tv is marvelous and it play full hd video very smooth although the remote design is not that much good as compare to other tv.",
            "Pros:\n\n1. Picture: SUPERB Picture quality!!! Especially HD channels are feast for eyes. Full HD vs HD difference is visible only if you watch the TV within 2 Meters.\n\n2. Angle View: WOW!!! Awesome!!! Those words won't really tell you my happiness for angle view; it is something more than the word \"PERFECT\".\n\n3. Price: WHOA!!! another exciting stuff, already at the best price in Flipkart and an additional happiness of 10% Citi bank cash back with EMI and I got a Panasonic 32\" LED TV just around 15K, yeah, it is not a deal absolutely a steal the deal, I'm in heaven guys!!!\n\n4. Delivery & Installation: As always Flipkart did a good job on delivery and Good experience with installation. I got an install ticket number along with the name & Phone number of the installation guy right after the delivery.\nThe guy who came to install offered me Swivel wall mount for Rs. 1850, but I turned down. Anyway, I\u2019m happy with whole delivery and installation process.\n\nCons:\n1. Sound: Sound quality of the TV is not good. But I can't complain, because my Sony Bravia that I purchased for Rs. 42K, has nothing much to offer in terms of sound output from the TV unless I connect to my home theatre system.\n\n2. NO Audio Output: THIS IS THE BIGGEST LET DOWN. YOU DON'T HAVE AN AUDIO OUTPUT, NEITHER HEAD PHONE JACK NOR ANALOG/DIGITAL AUDIO OUTPUT AT ALL.\nTHE RESULT IS YOU CAN'T CONNECT YOUR TV TO YOUR HOME THEATRE.\nIn other words, when you play your favourite movie or music video that you have in your pendrive,\nyou will be forced to listen the audio through TV speakers, not through your home theatre.\nYou are fine to watch TV when you have an HD set top box, because you could connect the set top box to your home theatre.\nI guess Panasonic deliberately left this feature out considering the price bracket it has. But I would expect basic features like this in any TV and that is the one and only reason I'm taking out one star, otherwise it is always 5 star or may be more :) :) :)\n\nOverall, A VERY HAPPY, NICE AND VALUE FOR MONEY PURCHASE EXPERIENCE.",
            "good TV from panasonic and worth for price for sure. Its been 1 month, it looks fine. sound quality and picture quality looks good too. I felt this is better than my current LG full HD Tv",
            "Splendid TV. picture quality is more than expected and sound quality is good. its a nice product in this price (17K),\n\nThis product deserves 5 star but I will deduct 1 star for its external look.\n\nBut any way the quality and performance is awesome, any one can blindly go for it delivery and support is also fantastic.",
            "I have recently purchased a panasonic 32 \" led tv from flipkart. It has good quality acording to price . Picture quality is best and sound quality also good. I have got panasonic best service for installation . installation completed after 2 hrs of delevery.",

            "Received the item within 14 hours of ordering and installation completed in another 3 hours. Hats off to FlipKart for speedy delivery.\n\nThis is a HD ready TV and for a 32'' that is all we need. We do not really need a FULL HD TV. Excellent clarity and colors. Saw many complaints about sound. If you are an audiophile, then you may not satisfy with the sound. For an average user, sound is very good. It is loud enough for a big hall. No complaints. Another complaint I saw in many reviews...\nREAD MORE",
            "I am using this TV, and my experience is wonderful. Picture quality is very good in both SD & HD channels. Wall mount is very sturdy. Sound quality is good & clear (but not as Samsung or Sony). For 12x12 ft. room sound is Ok.\nPrice also is very reasonable (bought only in Rs. 16230/-). Flipkart gives original product as it says on TV ads.\nVery much happy with product. I will recommend 100% for product and flipkart 4.5 out of 5.",
            "Bought @16490. Delivered and installed as per schedule. Thumbs up for Flipkart and Panasonic.\n\nFeatures:\n1. Display Clarity is superb in both HD channels and SD channels, `cause of IPS Panel.(5/5).\n2. Peripherals: only 1 HDMI , 2 would have helped. (3/5).\n3. USB plays most movies. Tried to play 1080p HD movies. Great picture quality.\n4. Sound is great. You would not need a speaker if your space size is 200sqft. (4/5).\n5. Refresh rate: 100hz (5/5). Cheaper alternatives such as micromax have 60hz. faster moving objects are not best seen on those leds.\nOverall best buy @ its prices. Great quality",
            "Working well so far. Good colors and picture definition is also very clear. All in all a great buy. Good value for money.",
            "Have been using this TV for a past few days and I am really impressed with the TV. These are the pros and cons I could find:\nPros:\n1. The image quality is excellent\n2. Audio is quite loud and clear, unlike mentioned in some other reviews\n3. The menu was very easy to navigate, again unlike mentioned in those other reviews\n4. All the ports work fine, have been using a lot of HDMI and the AV ports since purchase and no complaints yet.\n5. The wall mounting bracket comes as a separate package outside the original packing, and is included in the price (both are delivered together as one package).\n6. Installation is also included in the price.\n7. Delivery was very fast, I am impressed.\n8. With all the offers, it cost me around 15K which is an awesome deal.\n\nCons:\n1. There is only one HDMI and one USB port.\n2. There is no Audio Out\n\nMust also appreciate the service of Panasonic Coimbatore. The service person turned up on Jan 26 ( a national holiday when almost no office in the country works) just to make sure that the TV is installed in time for me to watch the R-day parade.Really appreciate that.",
            "Excellent LED at this price.and looks good,Very good picture quality in HD channels but Picture quality of SD channels just Ok. Sound is good. Overall good deal. Satisfied with this product. picture Quality looks better then other top brands, with out any doubt can get this product.",

            "Hi Dear Flipkart,\n\nI booked one Panasonic 81cm (32) HD Ready LED TV for 13th July 2016 through on your website. Today I have received my Led Item shipped by Gati Courier : 586201202 at 15:00pm after that reached my home with my courier and after that I check my LED but I saw his power cut automatic off/on ,please revert me at soon as possible,\nplease do the needful\n\nNOTE:- I want to change this Electronic item ,",
            "Not sure, which one is more worse. This TV or Flipcart customer Service.\n\nLets start with TV first :HDMI port n USB are placed such a way, after inserting Settop box input in HDMI, u have almost zero place to insert pen drive.if you do a wall mounting u have to forget the idea of watching movies from pendrive. Otherwise every time u have to take down the tv to insert the Pendrive.\n\nTv gets heated up like any thing after watching an hour or so.\n\nRemote is pathetic, not so userfriendly at all for watching stored movies.\n\nSound out put is very very lowwww.\n\nIf u have HD channels subscribed then channels are ok, but if u have normal cable connection , u r bound to have blurry pic quality. This kind of problem doesnt exsist in my other samsung tv.\n\nNow turn for Flipkart :\n\nI did not like the product at all & i want to buy other model TV, but there is no option of refund, only change of other pice is possible.\n\nI have been calling up there customer care for almost 2 times daily for last 5 days but sadly they do not have any authority what so ever. Only thing they can do is call transfer and arrange for a call back, which will not happen in promised time frame.\n\nI trusted Flipkart n i am suffering now.\n\nIf u r not a lazy bone go spend 500 rs extra and buy from local tv shop, trust me they will give far better customer service than flipkart, at least you will be able to check the model much better way.\n\nI guess flipkart product prices are inspired by Stockmarket up n down style. A product Shows up 3 different price tag in 3 consecutive days. U will always in a situation where u think what would be right time to buy the product.\n\nDont step into trap of low priced product, thats a actually your getway of suffering.\n\nWhat they promise in Commercial Ads are far away from actually they do in reality.",
            "I had purchased this product. At the time of delivery & installation I had requested that since I do not live in this city I would like to get it installed after a month. At that time the Pansonic person agreed.\n\nWhen I went to that city after a month, I booked demo & installation. He charged me Rs. 500 because I choose to install after 1 month. Suddenly hidden terms come out. He said \" Installation & demo is only free if you do it within 30 days. Otherwise it is chargeable. He also mentioned that per new policy if you don't install within 24 hours, it will be chargeable.\"\n\nTerrible way to offer a product at lesser price, then recover money from service.",

And also their customer service is not responding properly. When i say as i am going to return the TV but the customer care people said as you can't return it.

Rendering of images while viewing is messed up, makes high resolution pictures look potato quality in the tv.",
