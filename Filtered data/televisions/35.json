            "Picture is not clear n too bright. It appears like 3d without 3d glasses. It's that blurry. And contrast is too high. Everyone's face appears on tv is too flashy. Viewing angle is 120 Though they say 178. U can get good picture only at 90 as u go away U ll see picture go greyish. Looks good from far(10 ft onwards)\nConnectivity is ok. Has glitches like other android TV's. Chromecast is good. Sd box not recommended.",
            "TV is worth in the price range but accessories are not durable. Quality of Remote is substandard, it stops working with in 5-6 months despite decent usage. If you think of buying new remove, need to spend additional 2000. The satisfaction of buying smart tv at low cost vanishes, instead buy a branded tv like sony or samsung which has lasting durable accessories.",
            "The TV is a better option for people who are looking for non Chinese TVs. The picture quality of the TV is above average. The colours are flashy and you need to work to set them up for the first time as per your preference. Same is worth sound. Sound is also above average and can be set using several customisation options. There are a lot of features this TV has. Connectivity is excellent. Pure Android experience is great and we have options to install apps which are our favourite. In terms of build quality, TV is above average. The TV is light weight and is adequately strong. Seeing the price, we can say the TV is value for money. Buying extended warranty is recommended to use this TV with peace of mind.",
            "The setup and installation was on time. The remote is easy to use and Google assistant feature in the remote is very helpful.\n\nHad to download android remote app as sometimes you need to enter email address and password.\n\nThere is an option to select a default mode on startup that is helpful as we do not need to select HDMI option every time to go to the DTH set top box input.\n\nYou tube runs flawlessly. The HD content is clear but SD content looks a bit hazy\n\nOverall, I am satisfied with the product and the smart TV experience. Thank you Thomson.",

Thanking you....",
            "The TV is 2nd Thomson for me.\nPROs: The picture charity is good.\nThe sound is also good. Connectivity was not an issue. The biggest plus point- Non chinese option in good quality.\n\nThe picture and sound adjustment option should be provided even in all modes and no only in live tv mode. The dedicated button for Sinyliv is non functional.\n\nCONs: The memory expansion is not well supported. The access to the USB ports is very difficult due to back design. Could have provided at least one USB port at bottom",

Connecting TV with mobile is also easy like mirroring etc. The remote is nice and responsive. I had purchased 3 yrs warranty as well with this TV and it was little bit higher side as later on same was available at lower price. Delivery was done next day and installation in another 2 days to our satisfaction. Only issue I have, the TV hangs if you are running it on internet and trying to open multiple apps quickly.

After a month of purchase it started to get hanged every time even restart on many occasions. When I called service center they said they will send a technician for repair.

            "Definitely Full value for money. I had bought a 32\" Thompson TV last year too. Bit this 32\"model has Android OS which makes the experience even better and smooth. Build quality of TV is pretty good. Remote is also easy to use and navigate. However, it has 3 minor flaws.\n1. After you press the Power ON the takes 20-25 seconds to reach the initial screen.\n2. The quality of the remote is not satisfactory. The circular navigation button of the remote is of very inferior quality.\n3. The built in Wifi adapter is probably not good quality. Have occasional buffering when playing Prime Video/ Hotstar Sony LIV, etc. Even though there is dedicated WiFi modem in same room",
            "Writing this review after 6 months of use. Clear picture with clear sound is something worth the price. I bought this TV on offer at 10, 499/-. No issues detected till now. Hope it will provide a good service for atleast 3 years.",

            "This is not up to the mark like a smart tv.\nScreen disturb every time when I connect a USB, HDMI cable and any other device and also when wind flow outer side it is not working properly.\nSo this is used like a normal led tv not like smart tv.\nAlso screen caste not connected at any mobile.\nSo don't like.",
            "It's a very good led tv but if the price range should be 11k to 12k or below, sounds as well as picture quality is awesome,and connectivity is normal as you can see in other brand.. overall l felt it is good\ud83d\udc4d",
            "All Good!\n\nBut the Wall Mount TV stand/prop given with the TV made to shock and felt worst, because it is not perfectly designed and not capable enough to hold the Tv safely - it may easily put down the tv from the Wall. So I have purchased a New Wall Mount stand of Samsung Tv.\n\nAnd screen mirroring requires an additional App to be installed in our phone to mirror our phone screen.\n\nRegarding Netflix app - I thought we can install from TV Play store as we do in our android mobile phone but the issue here is the app itself not available in the android tv play store of Thomson Tv. Other than no issues - happy with the on time flip kart delivery with all safety measures and fast installation arrangements! Thanks to Flip kart and Thomson Jeeves service!",

            "I had purchased this TV on 05-Aug-2021 and have good experience with the functioning of the TV. I had also purchased 3 year total protection from Jeeves for this TV.\nHowever the remote supplied with it got defective within one month. When I called up Jeeves's team to help with remote issue, I was told that the support was ONLY for TV and not for accessories provided along with it.\nI then called up the toll free number provided on that TV manual but no body picked the phone. After waiting for 2 days and multiple tries to contact someone on the toll free number, I sent them mail stating my issue. Then I came to know that there is no on-site support provided by company for any issues with TV or accessories during warranty period or otherwise.\n\nI was asked to provide video supporting my claim of defective remote so that it can be verified by support team whether it is really defective or not. After I had submitted the video and it was verified that my complaint was genuine, I was asked to sent remote to the company so that they can send me a replacement. This will result in me not able to watch TV till I get new remote from company. They have not even provided the time by which remote will be delivered to me.\nThis is really a pathetic support from the company and I would not recommend buying TV due to the same",

You can even watch 1080p quality videos smoothly if you have a strong wifi connection.\n\n2. Sound - The sound quality is good, but if you need a movie or theater experience, then I would suggest you to buy a sound system and connect to this TV using bluetooth or ARC port.\n\n3. Connectivity - Most of Android TVs with version 9 are facing connectivity issues. However, I have not faced any such issue. My TV gets connected to wifi quickly, just like a smartphone. Also, TV has bluetooth to connect wireless headphones, mobiles and other smart devices such as Google mini, Alexa. If you have VGA cable, you can connect laptop too. You can connect Play station or Xbox also.\n\n4. Smart features - TV comes with built in chrome cast with only 1 drawback. Netflix app is not supported on this TV, hence the 4 stars rating. The default applications installed are Prime Video, Youtube ,Google Play Store, Google Play Music and many others. For using Netflix, we either have to connect mobile or laptop and cast screen to watch Netflix on TV.\n\n5. Design - the TV looks good with such a low price, even better compared to others. It is easy to mount it on stand or wall mount as per your need.\n\n\nThe only problems you may face if the TV is damaged during delivery of the product. In that case, you can always return it and request for new one as it comes with 1 year warranty.",

It's an Android TV with good looks, quick connectivity, nice sound (maybe little flat for music lovers) and a decent display for the price. I had to change my cable connection from SD to HD, in order to enjoy the real picture quality. The remote is very sleek & convenient too.\n\nI surveyed a lot online, analyzed & compared many brands and then got this TV skeptically, as it is not among popular brands. But I'm happy with my purchase. And I must say Thomson has done a great job from the earlier B9 series 32 inch which my friend owns ! And thanks to Flipkart for quick delivery, smooth installation & demo by Jeeves the partner. Customer support from Flipkart for a few queries I had was also excellent. Thank you Thomson & Flipkart !!",

SMART TV andriod is fast and responsive and easily connects to 5GHZ router speed (ACT)\n3. The setting are easily understandable and connect to external devices like mobile for casting etc\n4. You can connect multiple devices to the tv at the same time.\n5. TV can be connected to PC to be used as monitor\n6. Value for money\n\nCONS: 1. You need to manually change display setting to get best results( change using user defined modes i kept (contrast at 100 brightness,sharpness at 50 ))\n2. When you connect to PC you need to manually change the display setting and resolution in your PC to get usable display, can be used for watching multimedia and gaming\n3. The remote is not very high quality however if you can install \"SMart TV remote\" andriod app you dont need to use the remote.\n4. Sound is ok for the price however if you have sound bars like i do it doesnt matter\n\nConclusion: Value for money and display is very bright I dont think you can get this kind of display for this price",

            "Picture brightness is more than the required level. This can't be reduced for You tube and other wifi related videos. Whereas for the DTH connection, it can be altered.\nAudio quality is superb, giving a powerful theatrical effect.\nOn installation, everything was perfect except no audio when connected to HDMI cable from Airtel HD extreme box as there was mismatch between the resolution. Later it was rectified.\nRegarding the TV remote it is just for on & off, switch between inputs. You can't change the channels as other TV remotes are. So you must have the set top box remote side by side. It is a biggest drawback.\nNot supporting Netflix is a big drawback.\nJust within three months the reverse button of the remote is not working. For replacement I am fighting for more than 15 days, communicating via mails going on nearly 15 times, nothing fruitful. I was asked to produce video clips showing the defect in the remote which is ridiculous and too much. Instead of replacing it, I was advised to download the Android tv app in the mobile and to operate as a TV remote.\nCustomer care team is actually not supporting but dragging on the issue istead of resolving it.\nOverall the perfomance is just okay.",
            "Picture quality is great for the price. HD videos look particularly good. Perfect for bedrooms.\nConnectivity was also very easy for everything. Casting was smooth. Voice commands work well for YouTube search.\n\nOnly drawback is not having Netflix. Even casting didn't work from the phone but i can live with it and sound quality although very loud could have been better.",
            "Good product from Flipkart. Take 2 days for installation\nI was using this TV from last 1 week\nvalue for money good picture Quality good sound quality\nExcellent product from Thomson...........",
            "Very nice colour, good picture quality and value for money. Installation done on the same day of delivery. Overall worth buying this TV at affordable price.",
            "Its been three days since we got Delivery of TV. The person came on second day to install and it was flawless. He was very efficient.\nNow the TV - It's light in weight, small cute remote. The sound output is good and we tried using it with our Home theatre and the sounds effects are supercool. The Apps and Phone casting works fine. Just lags when you start the TV other then that no issues.\nThe colours are too bright for me though my Husband is OK with it.\nI must say, A smart TV with latest Android in this price is a catch. Let's see how it works further. My last Led run for 6 years without any issues.",
            "Picture quality is very poor due to LED panel has a black spot mark on the middle of the top panel and then I raised a complaint about the replacement of the TV. After receiving the replacement one it's quality very good. I like the TV also I like the Flipkart service.",
            "Bought this TV for the bedroom. I paid a total of 18.5K, very happy with the price. I am very happy with this product. Absolute value for money. There was a cheaper model from Thompson available for 16.5K, but it ran on Android 7, the one i bought runs on Android 9. The only downside is, it does not support Netflix whereas the older model does support it. This however is a newer product with better sound (24 vs 20). Maybe they will bring around netflix support at a later stage. It is a little slow to switch between apps, however not slow enough to spoil the experience.",
            "Thomson TV is a Value for Money and its what we wanted. I bought it for my father and he is more than happy with the quality and color. Even the service was fast and helpful. If you are looking for best Smart TV in this budget then you should go for this.",

That's the reason for high picture quality rating here. And shame on you people to rate it 5 star for getting extra 3 months warranty. You all are participating in their crime and deceit. You didn't have to sell yourself for mere 3 months of warranty. They know how the people are and they are playing you. Y'all piece of sh*t.",

They can't provide an ota update to fix this issue. Brightness is the best when compared with Nokia 43inch / Mi4a which only has 325 nits.\nAfter a couple weeks of usage remote nav keys don't work even after switching with new batteries. Their spares team asked me to send a video and now they want me to parcel the remote! this is weird! they don't have service franchise in my city and if the panel gets defective i'll have to parcel it too?!

Most of the time it shows no signal. So, please work on it.

Starting time very high.. it takes around 2-3 minutes just to start the television\n3. Started to hang. Screen gets frozen and nothing works. So you have to restart it. Though this is not a frequent issue. In 6 months I have observed it around 3-4times. But I fear it might increase after some more usage.",

Never had buffering issue till date.\nRemote is user friendly. Not like traditional remote with full of buttons.\nSturdy when placed on stand. Also can go for wall mount if needed.\n\nBought it for the senior citizens in my home and believe it or not the ease of use of this remote made them to make a full use of the smart TV. Thanks to the hot keys (especially YouTube) most of the TV remotes in market don't have YouTube as hot key. Believe me this simple thing will make the life easy for the seniors in your home.\n\nCons:\nRemote is not smooth. We need to aply little pressure sometimes. Those who used Firestick remote already will feel the quality difference. Surely the remote lags some quality. For the brand it should have been more premium. But serves the purpose so I am happy with it.\n\nSimply go for it. I see no negatives. Best TV for this price range. I already bought a 55 inch TV for my sister even that rocks. With that confidence I went for this 40 inch and even this satisfied me.",

Remote disign and function is very smart. But installation system by 3rd party neither Thomson nor Flipkart is very very bad. They have no professionalism, responsibility is less. It should be develop. Lastly they charged Rs. 490 for a HDMI Cord which is available in market or even in Flipkart within Rs. 140 to 229.Bound to pay 3 times of market price at that moment.",
