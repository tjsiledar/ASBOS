            "Netflix not available on this \"So called Smart TV\"\nWe are not able to install Netflix. because in Google Play Store Netflix not available even if you download from third party even then you will not able to watch Netflix because remote will not work support or work properly",
            "Best TV in this price range, best value for money tv\n\nPros\nSuperb 4K Video, your WiFi or broadband should be of good speed like 100 Mbps to enjoy online videos at high resolution\nPictures are clear and crisp, the default colour setting is high or vivid so that you can reduce from settings.\n\nAudio is loud and clear for a large living room or hall\n\nRAM is good 2 GB and it has a quad core processor so speed wise it's good.\n\nCasting from Mobile and Laptop is very easy and works like a charm since it has inbuilt chromecast.\n\nWifi and bluetooth connectivity is easy to setup.\n\nIf you have voltage fluctuation in your city/town ask company customer care if a stabilizer is required or not, in Mumbai there is no such issue so I am not using a stabilizer.\n\n\nCons\nYou cannot change the brightness contrast and colour when using Android apps or youtube you have to go back to TV AV mode then change\n\nNo netflix button on remote and no support to install Netflix app from Google play store, when you call Thomson customer care they will send you a link by which you can download the Netflix APK file and put it in a USB drive then connect it to TV and install the software. The Netflix app that they provide is a bit buggy since navigation is not easy in that but if you cast using your mobile or Laptop netflix to TV it works fine.\n\nOverall I think it's a good tv",
            "Got it as part of the sale. The picture quality is very clear and connectivity options are plenty. Using chromecast works like a charm. However the sound quality is a bit awkward. At lower volume levels there is some lag in the sound. Very helpful customer service that provides the patch for sound issue over email. After patch works seamless and very good quality. Picture colour and clarity is awesome.\nAll android apps work except Netflix.",
            "The build quality and picture quality is great and the sound is also good the only con is that it does not have netflix support . Also , I did not face any issue with sound as mentioned by previous users I think they have solved it for the new units. Pretty happy i got this product at a steal price of 17699 only.",
            "Only two points to rate the TV down.\n- No Netflix by default & you can\u2019t download / install it.\n- connectivity- specifically \u201cBluetooth connectivity\u201d it will keep paring & will pair when it wants. So you will much time in between to cook some snacks while watching TV.\nSuggestions\n- if you tends to buy this TV. Better to take sound bar along with this so you listen good sound. Though TV inbuilt speaker are good enough.",
            "I think I bought most valuable item I got great items in very less amount Thank you Flipkart.. for provided me such a great deal..",
            "Awesome tv.\nSound not that good though.\nAmazing clarity and quality. Multiple connectivity options. Very bright screen. Minimal but workable remote controller.",
            "Good product. Nice picture quality. Good volume.looking nice I am fully satisfied",
            "Got my tv installed today ,was so eager given the details and onboarding features ...\nAs I was switching thru different features and exploring tv capabilities I found out that there was fluctuation in sound or audio of the tv , at first I thought there was problem rather defect with the audio configuration of the tv ,and it turned out to be a software glitch with the tv which the company fixed by contacting each and every buyer of the tv and notifying them on how to fix the issue ,after following some easy steps the issue was resolved and the tv just became Perfect .\nAlso appreciate the friendly gesture of the company .\ncoming on the display panel,it's just amazing ,colors are vivid also there is an option to set it according to your preferences.\nInterference is smooth and easy,\nNo lag as of now , the processor is upto the mark .\nMoreover this is not a CHINESE product .",
            "Picture quality is awesome. Colors are more vibrant than Chinese brand realme and mi . Sound is good. There is no problem of sound fluctuations in my 55 inches 9R series as mentioned in others reviews. So go for it. Installation guy from Jeeves is not knowledgeable. He has no idea about the functions of tv. However Thomson customer care call me day after installation from their own and guide me well about the functions .

Told me that this brand uses faulty and cheapest quality parts imported from China that barely last a year.\n- Quality-wise nowhere near other brands in the same price range.\n- Low-grade HDMI, USB, 3.5, and 3 Pin Video ports.\n- Use a voltage stabilizer to power this otherwise you never know what can go wrong.\n- Within 2 days display backlight started flickering.\n- Company-provided tv wall-mount is only good for hanging towels in the bathroom.\n- Was able to connect the headset and speaker via Bluetooth but the quality of the sound is still terrible.\n- Although they say it's 4k but looks only as good as Full HD.\n- Very bad viewing angles, 60 degrees at max.\n- White color washes out, lack of picture depth & details.\n- Picture light is too bright by default. It spoils gray color. The worst part is that brightness, contrast, color controls are difficult to find. You have to switch to some HDMI input in-order to see them. Stock OS doesn't show them.\n- Internal speakers are pathetic. I tried connecting 2.1 speakers using a 3.5 mm jack. It produced too much noise. Faulty port.\n- Too much color saturation at 1080p and above, whereas lack of color production when the same content is viewed at a lower resolution.\n- Cheapest build quality/plastic used.\n- Thicker bezels compared to OATH models.\n- Display panel is exposed to damage as there is no outer glass or plastic screen guard like the other models.\n- No Netflix app in the play store.\n\nOverall you will regret buying this. Please save your hard-earned money. Instead buy a used led tv of a well-known brand from a local shop or olex if your budget is so tight.",

Very pathetic. Please go for Hi-Sense.. worth the money. I have hisense and Thomson and this review based on pure comparison.\n\nUpdate on 21st June 21:\nNever go for Thomson TV. Pathetic customer support. My TV suddenly got into split screen mode and I tried factory reset. But now it's not even booting up. Have raised complaint and waiting for 5 days on resolution. Very poor support and there is no escalation contact too. Don't waste your money and repent later.",

            "good",
            "Dont buy Thomson 9R series 4k TV.\n\nReason\n1. The picture quality is good. On the flipkart website and thomson website, they have mentioned 10bit 4k HDR and HDR10+ 60Hz display but when i connected my Xbox one X ( native 4k HDR gameplay) it detected 8bit 4k 24Hz display. People can try this to check the display. So its clear lie. Further, none of the HDMI ports are able to provide 4k experience.\n\n2. The remote quality os really poor. It is made up of cheap plastic.\n3. Those who are intrested in watching netflix, there is no chance that you can install netflix and watch series withput lag. ( i talked with netflix customer care). However, thomson gives you netflix app ( one with apotide and other with atv launcher) both apps are slugidh and it will hang tv Os or restart tv automatically.\n\n4. There isn't any option related to HDR. Try and 4kHDR 60FPS video and difference will be visible. I'm using Galaxy note and i found the difference that there isn't any HDR option in the Tv.\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nIf you have extra money, you are free to spend on Thomson tv. Otherwise spend little more or go with EMI and and purchase standards company product.",

Viewing distance less than 10 feet may irritate the eyes.\nOne word for JEEVES TEAM. They are the technical support team of flipkart. Excellent experience with them. Installed within hours of delivery. It was neat and fast. Mr. Katare, the technician was a competent person. The topping on cake was the post installation support and follow up on part of JEEVES. They answered all my queries on phone. Called themselves to check my overall impression about the product and their service quality. Mr. Manoj, who called from Pune, arranged a con call with a technical expert to answer my doubts.\nOverall satisfying buy.",

            "The TV set has serious sound issues. After the Replacement, the issue still remains. I have tried Settings but no result.\nI am going to Return the Product.\n\nI contacted the Customer Care of the Company. They sent a patch link. After following the instruction, the TV is working fine. Thanks to the Company for their prompt response.\n4K quality is not so attractive, Sound is good.

            "The sound is very fluctuating, at low volume you cannot hear the dialogue and if u increase the volume you will not be able to sit as when the dialogue is audible the music is too high. Serious sound issue. Its irritating.\n\nSome linings from top to bottom after using 30 minutes\nI have requested for return.\n\nI got the replacement. I am changing the review from 1 star to 4 star. One is left as i have used this tv for 2 days only. Now the picture quality is good. There was sound problem but the thomson people are very helpful. They call on the next day of installation and sent a patch file and sent the full instructions to run the file in video also and its worked. Now the sound is good. Connectivity no problem. Thanks thomson people. Thanks Flipkart. I am",
