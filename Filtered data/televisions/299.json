            "Received it today and writing this review after watching 3 movies (approx usage 4 hours).\nDelivery:-\nOn time and the delivery boy opened the pack infront of me to show that no damage has occurred. 5 star for this.\nInstallation:-\n1) The person from Jeeves has come and assembled the legs as I wanted only table mount. But the handling of TV by him was cumbersome and I see the bezel got a slight bent as he lifted the TV by holding just one of its leg. These electronics are so delicate and costly. A well trained person would hold and lift the TV carefully with 2 hands. I hope I am not going to face any display issues due to this.\n2) The person from Jeeves only checked whether the TV is working for AV input. A responsible company will train its technicians to check AV, USB, HDMI ports for any faults and show the customer that all the inputs are fine and then confirm that the delivery and installation is fine.\nTV performance:-\nThe display is above average but if you are buying 43 inches the distance has to be at least 10 feet. Else the clarity will not be satisfactory for SD channels.\nI did not take smart TV. So I loaded few movies in MKV format on pen drive and watched them on TV. They look perfect.\n\nOverall the TV is good. Go for it. But the Jeeves service needs improvement and the company has to train them on handling the TV as it is someone's hard earned money and they should check at least three inputs AV, USB,HDMI.\nTV rating is 3.5. But I am giving the rating as 3 as the service needs improvement.\nShall update my review probably after using it for a month. I hope the after sales service is good with cloudwalker. Lets see.\n\nRegards,\nG Arun Kumar",
            "Product delivered and installed the same day. Must say a quick service and installation. Great service from cloud walker. Amazing customer support and best quality tv. Definitely a must buy.",
            "I'm 4 months used after Writing this review. CloudWalker tv is awesome TV no issues til now. it support 1080p Full HD Screen quality is very good. Multi Audio Video Files is not support in usb drive other wise no issues and all video format work well. my bad luck is after i purchased item 1000 down. HD CHANNELS is super clarity I'm used Airtel HD setup Box. TV Speakers are very Loudly very good quality Box Speakers used in this tv. and I'm Tanix TX3 Max Android TV Box used it is Support 4k Videos. after I use this tv box my tv normal tv to smart to converted. Lowest Price Awesome Tv Received My Family is also Very Happy.",
            "Good built in quality. Bazels are thin. Viewing angle is good. Remot control built in quality is good. User interface is friendly n easy to understand. Upscaing video processing is good n overall output of SD channels is fine. HD channels are shown uo to the mark. Ports are divided, some are kept on bottom to the panel n rest are kept on left side back to the panel. All are easily reachable n accessible. Booting time is normal. Sound output is loud n clear enough to listen in 25*20 sitting room. Surround sound gives theater like sound effects. Mounting clamps are strong enough to hold the TV unit. I have 32 inch samsung smart TV too at home n found cloudwalker gives a great picture quality and good sound output. I'm totally satisfied with it's performance n found this product is truly value for money. I purchased this unit on 14th January with amount of 19999 n was delivered on 16th n installation procedure was carried out on 18th.",
            "Firstly, its a great product no matter what for its price. Fast shipping. Bought this for 19,999 including 2 year extended warranty by jeeves.\n\nMaking it simple.\nPros,\n\nPicture clarity is superb for this price range. Viewing angle is good. Comes with IPS panel. Contrast ratio is good. Comes with all accessories in the box.\nLess bezzel which makes the tv looks big.\n\nCons:\nFirstly the finish is kinda cheap with all those transparent buttons at the bottom.\nSound clarity is poor had to buy a 2 channel panasonic to fix it.\nPorts are not numbered/named, had to refer the manual everytime i want to use any of the ports.\nAudio doesn't cut off in the tv when headphones are plugged in. Which is kinda odd because even after muting head phone still recieves audio.\nMenu function could have been better.\n\nOverall:\nIf you are on a budget and want a bigger tv. Definitely go with this. Spend couple of ks for a good sound system. Which is not bad comparing the price of the tv. Definitely worth the buy.",
            "At first flipkart service is too good ,same day installation.after 10 months my review\nCould walker tv 43inch full hd\nPicture quality fantastic for HD & normal\nSound all over good\n3USB\n3HDMI\nBox surrounding sound\nIps a grade panel Crystal qlty pic\nthis product value for money .",
            "Good product, worth every rupee paid. One issue is that the TV does not support Digital Dolbey sound hence no DD sound when using HD channels in DTH, normal sound work just fine",

            "Received it today and writing this review after watching 3 movies (approx usage 4 hours).\nDelivery:-\nOn time and the delivery boy opened the pack infront of me to show that no damage has occurred. 5 star for this.\nInstallation:-\n1) The person from Jeeves has come and assembled the legs as I wanted only table mount. But the handling of TV by him was cumbersome and I see the bezel got a slight bent as he lifted the TV by holding just one of its leg. These electronics are so delicate and costly. A well trained person would hold and lift the TV carefully with 2 hands. I hope I am not going to face any display issues due to this.\n2) The person from Jeeves only checked whether the TV is working for AV input. A responsible company will train its technicians to check AV, USB, HDMI ports for any faults and show the customer that all the inputs are fine and then confirm that the delivery and installation is fine.\nTV performance:-\nThe display is above average but if you are buying 43 inches the distance has to be at least 10 feet. Else the clarity will not be satisfactory for SD channels.\nI did not take smart TV. So I loaded few movies in MKV format on pen drive and watched them on TV. They look perfect.\n\nOverall the TV is good. Go for it. But the Jeeves service needs improvement and the company has to train them on handling the TV as it is someone's hard earned money and they should check at least three inputs AV, USB,HDMI.\nTV rating is 3.5. But I am giving the rating as 3 as the service needs improvement.\nShall update my review probably after using it for a month. I hope the after sales service is good with cloudwalker. Lets see.\n\nRegards,\nG Arun Kumar",
            "Product delivered and installed the same day. Must say a quick service and installation. Great service from cloud walker. Amazing customer support and best quality tv. Definitely a must buy.",
            "I'm 4 months used after Writing this review. CloudWalker tv is awesome TV no issues til now. it support 1080p Full HD Screen quality is very good. Multi Audio Video Files is not support in usb drive other wise no issues and all video format work well. my bad luck is after i purchased item 1000 down. HD CHANNELS is super clarity I'm used Airtel HD setup Box. TV Speakers are very Loudly very good quality Box Speakers used in this tv. and I'm Tanix TX3 Max Android TV Box used it is Support 4k Videos. after I use this tv box my tv normal tv to smart to converted. Lowest Price Awesome Tv Received My Family is also Very Happy.",
            "Good built in quality. Bazels are thin. Viewing angle is good. Remot control built in quality is good. User interface is friendly n easy to understand. Upscaing video processing is good n overall output of SD channels is fine. HD channels are shown uo to the mark. Ports are divided, some are kept on bottom to the panel n rest are kept on left side back to the panel. All are easily reachable n accessible. Booting time is normal. Sound output is loud n clear enough to listen in 25*20 sitting room. Surround sound gives theater like sound effects. Mounting clamps are strong enough to hold the TV unit. I have 32 inch samsung smart TV too at home n found cloudwalker gives a great picture quality and good sound output. I'm totally satisfied with it's performance n found this product is truly value for money. I purchased this unit on 14th January with amount of 19999 n was delivered on 16th n installation procedure was carried out on 18th.",
            "Firstly, its a great product no matter what for its price. Fast shipping. Bought this for 19,999 including 2 year extended warranty by jeeves.\n\nMaking it simple.\nPros,\n\nPicture clarity is superb for this price range. Viewing angle is good. Comes with IPS panel. Contrast ratio is good. Comes with all accessories in the box.\nLess bezzel which makes the tv looks big.\n\nCons:\nFirstly the finish is kinda cheap with all those transparent buttons at the bottom.\nSound clarity is poor had to buy a 2 channel panasonic to fix it.\nPorts are not numbered/named, had to refer the manual everytime i want to use any of the ports.\nAudio doesn't cut off in the tv when headphones are plugged in. Which is kinda odd because even after muting head phone still recieves audio.\nMenu function could have been better.\n\nOverall:\nIf you are on a budget and want a bigger tv. Definitely go with this. Spend couple of ks for a good sound system. Which is not bad comparing the price of the tv. Definitely worth the buy.",

            "i am writing this review after one month of usage.\npros:-\n1very nice price. got the tv under 15k. this is a very attractive price for 43 inches tv.\n\ncons:-\n1. blur image. the image gets blurry when some fast moving scene s are on screen. the tv is not optimised for high fps shots.the image quality is not up to the mark.\n2. audio:- if you are even a little bit choosy about sound, you will be highly unsatisfied with the speakers of the tv. the speakers seem to be of very cheap quality. i put my altec lensing speakers and outperform the tv audio by way too much margin.\n3. remote.:- my remote died after 25 days of usage. called customer care and they told me that the remote will run only on duracel batteries. but in my case, even the duracel were unable to get the remote working.\n4. the customer care:- i called the customer care several times but even after 10 days the dead remote is waiting to be replaced.\n\nverdict:- not good. if you want a low cost tv then there are more brands available with some reliable customer care. try those. go for good refresh rate, some good audio output, and i suggest 4k for this screen size.",
            "After 10 days of use..I recommend this tv ..best in class tv with low price... installed 2 hours After delivery ... clarity both sound and video is very good...cons is it play only selected format files... clarity is good with TACTV setup box",

            "TV was delivered on 23 jan and am writing this review on 25. Based on my limited usage picture quality is really good and sound is also very loud. I really liked the remote for functionality, my older tv was LG and in it, to change source was a huge task. But this remote has dedicated buttons to toggle for hdmi, usb, tv. Also dedicated button to change picture and sound mode. Installation by jeeves was thoroughly professional, with installation engineering coming at promised time and taking full care to not to spread dust caused by drilling. Thanks to Flipkart for making this purchase a pleasurable experience. five star to Flipkart, jeeves and last not the least Cloudwalker for excellent product",
            "Great product. Superb picture clarity. Very easy to operate. Sound is ok and decent. The delivery was on time. The next day installation is done by Jeeves services which is probably a third party who has a tie up with Cloudwalker. Overall experience is nice. I am using the product and totally loved it. It is really a great deal for the price of Rs.19000 and quality of picture is not at all poor compared to products like sony, samsung or LG. Go for it guys. Thumbsup to Cloudwalker for such an amazing product at this prize range.",

I did not wanted the smart TV or android TV or 4k or curved TV.... because TV is meant to be TV and I don't like to play with it so I choose this simple LED and believe me it's a real bargain for the money. sound and picture is perfect. viewing distance is 10 ft and it gives a theatre like effect. guys, go for it if you don't want to play with your TV like a mobile.... Cheers!!",

But I have connected my laptop to tv using hdmi and able to use all files.\n2) For wallmount, usb connecting is bit difficult because very less space will be available backside.

But this TV is superb beyond the thoughts . No words to describe. Just go for it without any doubt.
