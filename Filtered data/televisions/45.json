The overall build quality of the tv is good. The display clarity is good along with the colour reproduction. HD channels is recommended for best experience. USB port is available to connect your phone/pendrive. The user interface is simple and won't confuse first time user. The sound is loud enough for 20 sqft room.\nBad things:\nThe remote build quality could have been better but not a deal breaker. The speakers can be improved by adding more bass.",
