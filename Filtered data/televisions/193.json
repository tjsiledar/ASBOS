            "So I bought this TV last week. And I already knew the why and what of this product. Why to buy it and what to expect out of it. Actual user experience is of one week.\nKodak's CA series is one of the best range of LED Television that the company has put out, competing directly against the likes of VU, Redmi, Motorola, TCL..etc.\nSo let's get straight into why and what -\nWhy - Because it's a purely made in India product which can compete and win against some of the best in this price range when compared feature to feature.\nI had two concerns with this model. First it has single band wifi that will only connect with 2.4Ghz signal (I thought for streaming 4k videos you need to have 5ghz wifi frequency which will require Dual Band wifi which comes with additional cost), and second the storage is 8 GB out of which only 3.7 GB is available for use.\nHave been streaming 4K videos without any lag whatsoever over 2.4 GHz wifi. So that solves the connectivity issue.\nSecondly, being an android TV, it easily allows you to setup pen drive (remember to use USB 3.0) as a storage for apps. I am using a 32 GB Kingston Swivl pendrive which cost around 600rs. So this solved the storage issue. And hence my why was justified.\n\nNow what to expect out of this model -\n\nPicture quality - as good as any other brand in this price range and even higher. (Not comparing with LGs, Samsung's and the Sony's)\nSound quality - as good, if not better, than other brands in this price range.\nProcessor performance - more than enough for my requirements - UHD/4K streaming of OTT contents and XBOX gaming.\nCustomer service - Yet to experience it but guys from Kodak called me and asked me if the TV is working fine and also shared the customer care number and promised on site support. I live in Gurgaon. Customer care experience can vary from place to place.\n\nBased on actual user experience I can say that this TV has proved to be more than what I had expected.\n\nA pure value for money buy!",
            "I ordered on 19th march morning got delivered to home around 20th March 12.30 PM and installation done with in 2 hours\n1) It's like easy to install I can say plug and play\n2) 4k video quality is impressive\n3) Bezel less screen looks grand\n4) Almost 2 days so for no problem\n5) at great in online market cheapest in the segment\n6) personally I am happy for the selection - KODAK 65\" 4k,ANDROID 9",
            "Superb TV in this budget category, panel is extremely bright which gives fantastic experience while watching 4K videos there is no lack and transition is smooth, lower resolution videos are also giving good experience, easy to cast from mobile and laptop. Sound quality is optimum but i have good sound system and I have connected that system with TVs Bluetooth very easily. So it's the best value for money TV in this category.",
            "Quality of the product compared to its other competitor brands like Xiaomi, Realme, VU, TCL, etc is below expectations.\nHere is feedback after 2 months of usage:\n1. Sound Quality is very flat with no clarity and there is no Bass, just feels like loud noise for a low cost speaker.\n2. TV remote is of very poor build and not durable. My remote stopped working after 2 months.\n3. Picture quality at low resolutions like 720P or 1080 P is very bad and there seems that upscaling feature is not effective as expected.\n4. Even though its a Android TV there is no Update relaeased from manufactures of the softwares. Other brands offer a much better software patch updates.\n5. Android interface is very slow over the period it starts to get hanged and need to be hard reset. Some issues are there like volume missing which requires a restart. Also it takes time to restart the android boot screen.\n\nIn my opinion other popular brands are a safe option to buy since they have been there for long and large customer base ensures better software experience, features, better support from manufacturer.",

            "My journey to buy KODAK 4K UHD LED ANDROID TV...\n\nAlways i dreamt about 4K LED TV. After long months of research i came into the conclusion of buying KODAK 4K UHD LED ANDROID TV. As a online purchaser i know the cons & pros of products, so i started searching, comparing the products & reviews. Like you, the first came in my mind was brand names like SONY, LG, SAMSUNG, etc.. But as of the present situation it was hard for me to buy those brands in limited budget. I need 4K UHD LED ANDROID TV with in my budget but without any compromise in features & performance. And it was the time for the new budget TV search. I ended up with the competiting Smartphone Brands like MI TV, MOTOROLA, NOKIA, REALME, ONEPLUS etc.. While, one of my friend recommended KODAK. The first memory arised in my mind was the old Kodak film camera. But i was really confused about buying a TV from KODAK. Started deep researching gone through different reviews, finally decided to buy it.\n\nAnd today, after using for one month what i can say you is..\nPROS:\n>The most attraction on this TV is its design. Its very light, slim design. completely BEZEL-LESS display as they offer.\n>Outstanding Display performance compare to other brands. Viewing angle is also great.\n>Data usage is very very less compare to smartphones.\n>Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Built-in Chromecast everything works perfectly\n>4K videos is very smooth & sharp.

            "So I bought this TV last week. And I already knew the why and what of this product. Why to buy it and what to expect out of it. Actual user experience is of one week.\nKodak's CA series is one of the best range of LED Television that the company has put out, competing directly against the likes of VU, Redmi, Motorola, TCL..etc.\nSo let's get straight into why and what -\nWhy - Because it's a purely made in India product which can compete and win against some of the best in this price range when compared feature to feature.\nI had two concerns with this model. First it has single band wifi that will only connect with 2.4Ghz signal (I thought for streaming 4k videos you need to have 5ghz wifi frequency which will require Dual Band wifi which comes with additional cost), and second the storage is 8 GB out of which only 3.7 GB is available for use.\nHave been streaming 4K videos without any lag whatsoever over 2.4 GHz wifi. So that solves the connectivity issue.\nSecondly, being an android TV, it easily allows you to setup pen drive (remember to use USB 3.0) as a storage for apps. I am using a 32 GB Kingston Swivl pendrive which cost around 600rs. So this solved the storage issue. And hence my why was justified.\n\nNow what to expect out of this model -\n\nPicture quality - as good as any other brand in this price range and even higher. (Not comparing with LGs, Samsung's and the Sony's)\nSound quality - as good, if not better, than other brands in this price range.\nProcessor performance - more than enough for my requirements - UHD/4K streaming of OTT contents and XBOX gaming.\nCustomer service - Yet to experience it but guys from Kodak called me and asked me if the TV is working fine and also shared the customer care number and promised on site support. I live in Gurgaon. Customer care experience can vary from place to place.\n\nBased on actual user experience I can say that this TV has proved to be more than what I had expected.\n\nA pure value for money buy!",
            "I ordered on 19th march morning got delivered to home around 20th March 12.30 PM and installation done with in 2 hours\n1) It's like easy to install I can say plug and play\n2) 4k video quality is impressive\n3) Bezel less screen looks grand\n4) Almost 2 days so for no problem\n5) at great in online market cheapest in the segment\n6) personally I am happy for the selection - KODAK 65\" 4k,ANDROID 9",
            "Superb TV in this budget category, panel is extremely bright which gives fantastic experience while watching 4K videos there is no lack and transition is smooth, lower resolution videos are also giving good experience, easy to cast from mobile and laptop. Sound quality is optimum but i have good sound system and I have connected that system with TVs Bluetooth very easily. So it's the best value for money TV in this category.",
            "Quality of the product compared to its other competitor brands like Xiaomi, Realme, VU, TCL, etc is below expectations.\nHere is feedback after 2 months of usage:\n1. Sound Quality is very flat with no clarity and there is no Bass, just feels like loud noise for a low cost speaker.\n2. TV remote is of very poor build and not durable. My remote stopped working after 2 months.\n3. Picture quality at low resolutions like 720P or 1080 P is very bad and there seems that upscaling feature is not effective as expected.\n4. Even though its a Android TV there is no Update relaeased from manufactures of the softwares. Other brands offer a much better software patch updates.\n5. Android interface is very slow over the period it starts to get hanged and need to be hard reset. Some issues are there like volume missing which requires a restart. Also it takes time to restart the android boot screen.\n\nIn my opinion other popular brands are a safe option to buy since they have been there for long and large customer base ensures better software experience, features, better support from manufacturer.",

            "I have been using this tv for the past 5 months, so these are my thoughts:\n1. Picture quality is very good, can play 720p videos without any blurry effects. Dont recommend to watch 480p videos since the clarity will be less but still watchable.\n\n2. Sound is ok if u r in a quiet room, but with external noises it will be hard to hear unless you hav a external speakers or any other setup\n\n3. Connectivity is good, i am using jiofi to stream all the content, hav not faced a issue. Only having 2.4ghz connection though.\n\n4. OTT services like prime, disney+, netflix, content is good to watch with the HDR effects.\n\n5. (Major issue) Everyone's in a while tv will turn of automatically while watching any content ( not app specific). I have encountered around 10 times till now. NOT SURE IF ITS SOFTWARE ISSUE OR HARDWARE ISSUE. but it kills the experience.\n\n6. Remote is ok but sometimes the response might be slow, while turning on the tv ,mostly.\n\nPlease note: After purchasing this tv, will get a call from the representatives from Kodak telling that they wll extend the tv warranty by extra 6 months if we put good comments about the product and whatapp them the screenshot.",
            "Update-Review after a couple of month's usage:\n\n> The HDR is stopped working via HDMI( tested with ps4 and gtx 1650). Netflix dolby vision works.\n> The remote stopped worki g properly after 2 months. Support center wont troubleshoot propely. They asks for video proof constantly rather than understanding the issue. They won't event hint how to buy a new remote.\n> The customer service only works in the first week to get a high rating and slowly they wont care after it.\n>Cannot enjoy tv properly due to the misbehaving remote(automatically returns to home/skips content. Changed battery 3 times. Battery is not the issue)\n\nFirst Impressions:\n\nMy previous TV was VU 43inch fHD tv. 3 years old. The colors were bright washed, the gradient banding was high. The sound output below average.\n\nAt Present:\n\nAfter a weeks usage i would say the experience is good. Like its worth the pay, but not perfect (if you like to nitpick). But as a fily driver it performs and wont let you down.\n\nDisplay:\n\nThe display is good, there are slight gradient banding but wont affect the experience.\nThe blacks are deep. But the overall gamma is cold(can be adjusted)\nWhen viewed from sides, small blueish tint is experienced(may be gamma thing!!).\n\nSometimes the colors gets over saturated or flushed out. (Have to fiddle with settings to correct these)\nTested HDR with PS4, it does make a difference in gaming.\n\nDolby vision: there are a couple of movies/series in Netflix that support. Tested and works.\n\nRemote TV connectivity: update: dies very quickly, un reliable.\n\nWhen switched on, takes a little time for the remote to pair up and initialize or so. For a few mins the controls will lag, after 2 mins things will become smooth.\n\nSound:\n\nThe tv speaker is moderate. It does the job and way better than my old VU.\nConnected my 2.1 using toslink, the output is good(supports pcm and Dolby digital)\n\nHaven't tested hdmi arc's performance and support.",

            "Hi, Writing this review after 19 days of usage. I always believed in the myth that TV means we should go for Sony, Samsung or LG. But the myth is finally busted. I am the proud owner of Kodak 65 inch 4K UHD TV. I cannot be we can get such a big master piece at 49K which is the cost of most of mobile phones today. It is absolutely 5 star in every aspect of technical spec.. With all the anti china sentiments around, it is perfect time to bring home a product Made in India by a very old TV manufacturing Indian company. Not sure why people should go for major brand like Sony when we have everything and more in our Indian made brand at such a competitive price. I would say just close your eyes and click the BUY button, because I have done all kind of research before buying this master piece.\n\nI honestly request Kodak to make 75 and 85 inch TVs. I will be the first one to buy a 85 inch TV if they launch. If you ask me, every Indian should support this brand for their honest efforts in selling such a class product at this price. I used Sony 55 inch for last 5 years, this product beats Sony in every minute technical spec. I did quite a bit of research before finally settling on Kodak 4K TV. I myself is proud of my decision. Just go for it and say final good bye to all Chinese companies like mi, OnePlus, realme etc.,",

            "Writing this review after 3 days usage of a 50\" TV-\nPros -\na. Delivery and installation were done within the given time frame\nb. The picture quality is very good, you don't see any pixels even from a 4 feet distance.\nc. Android works pretty well, connects quickly with OTT platforms (used with PrimeVideo and Hotstart).\nd. Bezels are very thin, even the bottom one is just wide enough to show a Kodak logo.\ne. 1.75 GB RAM works fine, I don't see any lags even while watching part of fast action movies like Aquaman, Avengers, or any dance sequences.\nf. Works very well even with the hotspot network of my mobile. Watched 20-25 minutes of a movie on hotstar using my network mobile, and there was hardly any lag.\n\nCons -\na. Sound quality is okay, certainly has some room for improvement. Good thing is that it doesn't distort even at max volume.\nb. If I unplug the TV then I have to tune the TV again, which takes almost 3-4 minutes. I think it's more an android thing, rather than Kodak, or maybe I am missing something.\nc. Build quality can be improved - If I go very near to the TV, on the sides I can see a gap between the front-panel and back-screen. Thinking if I should report and ask for fix/replacement.",

            "Nice TV with Android supporting apps.\nOnly thing that is lacking is sound quality, it should have been much better as you cannot enjoy songs if you are music lover.

Kodak please work on your sound system.\nDelivery was proper and installation was also quick and the person made us understand how to use the remote as well.",

After pressing 3 to 4 times it is responding rest all everything is awesome in this tv I can say.",
            "Good value for money, picture is of a decent quality and brightness, it has good features with Android TV OS and plentiful connectivity. Only thing missing is a standard 3.5mm jack (although optical gives better sound output) and the inbuilt speakers are a little bit of a let down (which inbuilt speakers aren\u2019t right?). Happy with the purchase, the delivery and the service so far.",

            "I am writing this review after usage of 5 days. I will try to be detailed with least possible words ;)\n\n1. Picture Quality - It's decent given the price at the same time don't expect it to BRAVIA level. Color repro is also good and white/black is also repo'd well. Though the viewing angle is not that great. You would want to sit around 130~140 instead of 170ish as mentioned.\n2. Sound Quality - This TV is loud and can produce decent mid and highs. Dont expect to produce good low's.\n3. Product Quality - That's questionable as in my TV unit, I can see gaps between screen and it's base. Interestingly, it's not interfering with picture quality or with colors.\n4. Apps - YouTube started crashing on 3rd day. Though, rest are loading fine.\n\nAs mentioned in title it's a decent product give the price. I will try update the review after some more usage.",
            "Quality is hell good picture and surrounded sound, premium remote with hot keys like Netflix, YouTube,prime video, playstore and remote is made of aluminum and glosy plastic gives premium feeling ,worth buying 50\" 4k UHD HDr10 TV go for it. Sound is of top quality Dolby digital DTS assurround Sound , from 30 watt 3 speakers, new Android 10, mediatek processor, wifi 2.4,Bluetooth 5.0 latest, I can download from 5000+ app from playstore from t.v. it got inbuilt google search hot key too, internet connectivity of this Tv is very fast good, even I can play YouTube video from my mobile Hotspot and we can connect so many Bluetooth ,wifi devices.",
            "sound Quality and picture is excellent, thank you flipkart for delivering wonderful product. but i am not happy with wall mount provided with tV its not getting fit because of that i am using table stand.",
            "Good One ActualLy..WorTh For This Price. Its Comes With Table Stand Which is Better. So It Dosent Require That You Should Wall Mount. If You Have Internet Connectivity In Home Then This Tv Is ReallY WorTh BuYing. You Can Browse nd Access EverYthing You WisH For. ChroMeCastiNg Works PerFecT No Matter, What Videos You Watch in Your Mobile You Can CasT It With Your Tv And SiT Back and Watch RelaxedLY. Even For Gaming Such as PlasyStation 4 Is Also Awesome. So At this Price Range You Can Go For KodaK Tv!!",
            "Nice Product from Kodak at this price range.\nIt has an Amazing display. Sound quality could have been better but cannot ask more at this price range. Overall a very good quality with an aggressive pricing.",
            "I bought 65inch Kotak. This is my second 65inch TV. I purchased the second one after a year from first one. I am quite impressed with Picture quality. Good price range for this size of TV. Flipkart delivered it on time and installation was very good as I have to do wall mounting.",
            "A good value product for the cost. The product arrived one day before schedule, neatly packed. The installer immediately followed up and it was installed on the same day. Picture quality is good. I could watch my favorite videos in 4K quality through you tube. But you must have a good Data plan. Else switch to HD or lower quality. I was a bit worried about the sound quality but I could adjust the settings to switch off the system sound and keep only the surround sound ON. After doing this, I really enjoyed listening to lot of music videos. A user friendly remote with a voice search assistant. I liked the product very much. The only con being the wall mounting stand could have been of extendable type.",
            "This was a great deal ofcourse at this price especially, kodak amazes us with its immense picture quality(comparable to some mediocre and premium brands ) and sound effects from Dolby , connectivity and other android features are all great, Google voice assistant is also responsive. Yet there were some flaws that I could identify such as the design and build quality , when the tv is wall mounted it's difficult to reach the usb, hdmi and av ports as they are placed at the centre of the back panel. It's manageable but quite annoying sometimes. The build quality is not very good but it does satisfy us. The screen is very close to being bezel less. The 1.75 GB ram does it's job , I wouldn't say it's very fast , but yeah it's fast enough , the 8GB internal memory was a disappointment because we cannot install a lot of apps , yes we can add an external memory support , but some apps cannot be installed on usb. The product is actually the greatest we can get at this price range. Installation was done within 4 days of delivery. Overall performance: works like a charm. :)\nEdit:\nThe remote had some issues after approx. 1 month of purchase, I contacted customer care and their service is not very satisfactory. Haven't received remote yet and the process to get it is very complicated.",
            "I found that it was an awesome one. Picture quality is excellent. Sound much better. Connectivity is good. Overall very worth for money. Best product in a low cost. Prefer this.",

            "Kodak Brand TV It's Very Nice,\nSpeed Connectivity & Mirror Cast It's Speed Super Very Easy Conenting settings, 4K Video Quality it's awesome Super Product value for money",
            "I was little hesitant to buy a non famous brand and since I wanted to avoid the Chinese brand, I researched online and got few options like Kodak and Nokia. Then on the budget constraints I went for Kodak. I purchased few months back and I had no compliance and it works beautifully. Specially the brightness and the sharpness is too good. Sound is also very good. Keep the good work guys.\n\nOne small suggestion from my side is the wire connector. If there is an option to have a 90 digree bent plug, it will be good to have the plugs connection hidden behind the TV. I had attached the picture of the plug black of the TV.",
            "Its been two weeks now that i have bought this TV and i have the best experience so far. Top quality at affordable prices.",
            "Review after 9 months: Simply awesome. Awesome picture quality: the clarity, the true color rendering, the vivid and lifelike colors, the great contrast, the rich black color resulting in great dark scenes. I used to have a plasma TV before and this comes very close as far as true black is concerned.\nGreat sound: Nothing like you've heard before on earlier LED TVs. I mostly use the sound through my music system via the optical channel to get true digital/Dolby experience, but am impressed by ...\nREAD MORE",

Thin Bezel. You hardly notice the tv frame.\n3. Adequate space between the tv and wall when mounted.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Sound Quality. Its good, not the best, but if you have an external speaker or soundbar, then trust me, the TV watching experience is very good.\n2. 2.4GHz Bluetooth band. Not that it's not enough, but latest TV ...\nREAD MORE",

            "Excellent TV in this price range, you get HDR10, Dolby Vision, MEMC, After lot of searching finally settled on this model.\n550 nits of brightness & high contrast ratio makes the picture look quite punchy.\nRemote control is also very good as you can control VLC/MX player & KODI from it\n4K videos are treat to the eyes, also high bit rate 720p & 1080p videos look nice.\nFor DTH HD channels look awesome & SD channels are also watchable\nOverall best value for money TV & last but not the least a made in India product",

            "Just go for it without thinking best picture quality and bezless design . Sometimes remote control lags in functioning like if you press the button then it doesn't response . Loud speakers and free installation . Thanks to Flipkart for safe and fast delivery",
            "every thing is nice 1) picture 2) sound 3) connectivity another thing it will be batter if some thin blaze is incorporated in this tv, otherwise some glue stickr like cellotape is sticking there to keep the pannel (display) attached with body ( back side). thank u kodak tv.",
            "As a basic smart tv is good but you won\u2019t get camera option in app settings. Hence u can\u2019t connect zoom with cam. No point of meeting without cam and smart tv of no use in lockdown where we have online classes and meetings.",
            "Great display panel quality at this price. Minor light bleeding towards the left hand side corners.\n\nSound is just okay - doesn't feel like 30W speakers. My panasonic with 30W speakers is much louder, crisper, and overall has a better balance.\n\nThe tv is very light and the build quality is okay for this price. Do not expect flex-free solidness.\n\nThe user interface is stock android tv 9. So that's good! Hopefully it'll get updates to at least android tv 10 and 11 in the life cycle of the product.\n\nThe remote is great if you have a live tv source. It's a big remote.\n\nIf you only watch content from streaming services, you might want to get a smaller smart remote and pair it with the system. Something more like the remote on a mi box 4k or fire tv stick.\n\nThe mount provided with the tv was extremely flimsy and not worth it. I paid the installation person rs.1500 and bought a new proper adjustable mount from him which looked a lot more solid.",
            "Very Good Smart TV in this range but I am not able to install some of the important Apps like Adobe Reader and so on. Otherwise Excellent.",

Value for Money.. Thank you Kodak.\n\nDelivery and installation was so quick and also provided on call assistance. Thanks...",
            "Smart TV at this price is certainly incredible. This is Android and true 4k experience with excellent sound with expected bass. Remote Interface is too good to move around and voice commands through google assistant makes the entertainment hassle free and smoother. This can easily be compared with leading brands and I would rather say nothing could be expected beyond within this price range.",

            "This is an excellent value for money purchase with brilliant display. The colours are extremely accurate and it has great viewing angles.

Right corner some white light dominated the output picture. When i complaint about this to kodak company they said that \"its IPS panel backlight,that is not the issue.\" This is the only issue that is also mild. If you use hd setbox it is not effecting output picture.\n\n2. Back panel usb ports, hdmi ports located middle of the tv. When you fix the TV with wall mount it is difficult to insert pendrive etc. These 2 are small issue only i have.\n\n\n\nFinal word.\n\nBest in 42\" smart TV.",

            "Best for its value for money. I think its safe to say it has exceeded beyond the the expectations. The colors and tones are easy on the eyes. No harsh blue light. Sound is pretty decent. The design in sleek and elegant. The build quality is average, but it can't get any better for the price we pay.\n\n4k gaming and streaming has been great with this device. An external device (ex.gaming console, setup box, etc...) helps the 4k content run more smoothly.",
            "Being using it for a year now, awesome tv for the price. Good visuals, sound and features. I am using it as my PC monitor and the texts and visuals are crisp. The only issue is the UI could be improved as there is no way to control the brightness of the tv or other such settings when you in the android interface of the tv ... you can only see these settings on the lock screen or when you are connected to any input(hdmi, etc). But otherwise go for it as no other non-chinese brand in the market can beat this price at this time.",

It is mix of old and new style.\nSD picture quality: decent enough to view.",

This TV fulfill your all requirement.\n\nSound quality is also good but it would be good idea to buy good external speaker if you are sound lover otherwise for general home use, sound output is good enough.",

If ur budget below 25k then u can choose this tv.this my honest review.thank u.\nI here that remote doesn't work after a month,you can control your android TV with Android TV remote app from ur Mobile then y u need remote.\n\nReview after 5 - 6 months\nPicture quality is awesome in this price range\nIf u compromise with build quality definitely go for this.\nI observed the con is build quality and sound remaining all good.",

I trended this product for a week to book and get it. But this tv is not working after 10 months of installation, inspite of guarantee n warranty the KODAK CO. team delaying to repair/replace the TV saying due to lockdown they are unable to give the repair service.

            "Quality and design of TV is horrible & faculty. Line started appearing on screen within one year of use. Interface is very slow and connectivity of the TV with internet is very poor. Most important fact that they don't even have their own service Centre. They sent flipkart personal who was not even a technician, he simply took photo of TV & sent to someone. Their is no physical damage either on screen nor on body of TV, However, flipkart personal said it's internal crack and not covered in warranty. I said how internal crack can develop without any physical damage either on screen or body of TV that's means it's due faulty design of TV and should be covered in warranty. He said you speak to manufacturer.\nSo please think twice before buying any products of Kodak brand as their quality and design is faulty and prone to to defects that they will not covered in warranty. Further their service Center network is very poor and also they don't even cover defects developed during transit from or to their service centre.",

            "Great TV\n\nHi all,\n\nI was sceptical in buying this tv since it was new. But the pricepoint and the reviews lured me and I gave it a shot.\n\nIt's been one month of use but I think it's a good tv.\n\nThe picture quality is really good. I watch 4k shows on it and it looks spectacular.\n\nThe sound is also pretty amazing. Most TV's the sound does not work as well and you need to buy external sound bar or system but this tv has Dolby sound so even at low volume you can hear things well.\n\nLook and feel : it looks really good. The stand is also metal so it looks premium. I did not wall mount the TV since the stand look is exceptional.\n\nThere are few cons that are not mentioned elsewhere :\n\nWiFi connectivity : maybe this is unique to my tv but everytime I restart the tv, it connects to the wifi but shows no internet. I have to create a hotspot on my phone, connect to it and then disconnect and connect with the wifi again for it to work. It's slightly inconvenient is all\n\nUSB connectivity : I didn't realise this untill I bought the tv and it's not written anywhere specifically but you cannot connect your hard disk to the tv. It only supports pendrive with 32 gb storage. That's a real bummer because I used my hard disk to watch movies and shows on my previous Samsung TV. This is a disadvantage. If I had known earlier I would have bought another tv. But what is done is done.\n\nI am overall happy with my purchase and Kodak should continue to make these TV's.",

Finally one needs to switch off the Main power supply and restart it to function properly. Initially thought it's a connectivity challenge but finally realized that it's getting heat up and getting stuck. No movie runs for 3 hrs without getting stuck and restart. WiFi often gets no connection. Mobile hotspot also not getting the connected to the TV. However, I am greatly disappointed and dissatisfied with the purchase.\n\nI Rate it 3 out of 10 with this bad experience. Hope the service team will connect and rectify.",
