            "This 43\" Full HD Motorola TV is a game-changer at the price point at which it comes. Because almost everything we expect from a TV in today's time, comes bundled with it. And what we don't expect, for example a wireless Game-pad, that too comes out of the box. With thin bezels, Dolby Audio, great quality front-firing 20 W sound bar, this TV ticks all the boxes. The remote also comes with Google Assistant button as well as dedicated buttons for Netflix and YouTube for an easy experience. The presence of Android 9.0 (with future updates) makes sure it won't go obsolete in near future.",

            "I reviewed after one week analysis on 32 in TV.\n1)Picture quality is awesome but only maintain some distance from TV.\n2) Sound is also very good with enough bas,no need of home theater.\n3) Connectivity is also fine, Game pad take some time only first time paring after then it connects fastly.\n4)Two USB also connect firstly. Instead of screen mirror, cromo cast is given and connect easily by third party app 'Home' download in Mobile, and on Hotspot. By opening Hotspot you will cast YouTube v...\nREAD MORE",
            "till now product is pretty good but not excellent.... as i expected. Motorola said in description about its speakers is that front firing speakers. but in real its is at bottom firing. so i am suggesting to Motorola that,----- tell people ...proper information and proper specification of product and build your own trust for customers... there is little bit gap between screen and bezels. flipkart service is good .\ni will suggest motorola to manufacture 4K TV in 32 Inch also with 2GB or 3GB RAM . 1GB is enough for normal use but not preferred for heavy uses\ngaming controller is much pretty",
            "Please avoid this tv,it may bundle many feature but the screen is really bad.\nmy point is tv fundamentally first should have good display please don't go behind the features.\nI would recommend you to go with LG , Samsung or Sony .the smart feature can be brought with a steaming devices which could cost around 3000,\nI was using a LG TV before I brought this ,within minutes with this tv I was able to identify the flaw display It wasn't any defect display itself is like that.\nEven a SD channel used to look so good in my LG TV but even hd channel don't colour that well.\nScreen is not bright, contrast ratio, sharpness and colour reproduction is bad and not accurate. Hence much of said parameters aren't mentioned any where.More over they have used cheap edge led method which means led backlight are present only at the edges resulting in permanent grayish shades at edges when on white screen.\nFront firing sound bar is not as per they are advertising for 32 inch ,it's actually bottom facing two speaker. You cannot consider them as sound bar,they don't form a channel/chamber where sound resonate and that to it is made up of plastic doesn't have the that look asthenic wise as that you see in the adv pics.\nMy finally point is give most priority to display,things like speaker and any other smart feature can be addon at any point but display can't be done anything you have to bare with it please keep this on you mind.",
            "Excellent. Good experience but connectivity is bad\nsound is good and remote control is good but mirrior screening feature not availble and value for money led\nExcellent Delivery boy was good and installation engineer is good All Good",
            "Great tv for a price of 12800.... extremely smooth UI ...gameplay is stutter free even on a gud graphic game such as asphalt 8......boots quicker than Mi tv ....build quality is far far better than Mi tv.....if you want to buy a budget smart TV...you can blindly go for it...",

            "till now product is pretty good but not excellent.... as i expected. Motorola said in description about its speakers is that front firing speakers. but in real its is at bottom firing. so i am suggesting to Motorola that,----- tell people ...proper information and proper specification of product and build your own trust for customers... there is little bit gap between screen and bezels. flipkart service is good .\ni will suggest motorola to manufacture 4K TV in 32 Inch also with 2GB or 3GB RAM . 1GB is enough for normal use but not preferred for heavy uses\ngaming controller is much pretty",
            "Please avoid this tv,it may bundle many feature but the screen is really bad.\nmy point is tv fundamentally first should have good display please don't go behind the features.\nI would recommend you to go with LG , Samsung or Sony .the smart feature can be brought with a steaming devices which could cost around 3000,\nI was using a LG TV before I brought this ,within minutes with this tv I was able to identify the flaw display It wasn't any defect display itself is like that.\nEven a SD channel used to look so good in my LG TV but even hd channel don't colour that well.\nScreen is not bright, contrast ratio, sharpness and colour reproduction is bad and not accurate. Hence much of said parameters aren't mentioned any where.More over they have used cheap edge led method which means led backlight are present only at the edges resulting in permanent grayish shades at edges when on white screen.\nFront firing sound bar is not as per they are advertising for 32 inch ,it's actually bottom facing two speaker. You cannot consider them as sound bar,they don't form a channel/chamber where sound resonate and that to it is made up of plastic doesn't have the that look asthenic wise as that you see in the adv pics.\nMy finally point is give most priority to display,things like speaker and any other smart feature can be addon at any point but display can't be done anything you have to bare with it please keep this on you mind.",

            "Very nice TV I loved it. I bought especially with the name tag which is Motorola and yes the name itself was the main reason to buy as Motorola entered in the world of television. I bought 43\" led tv which is beautiful in looks and have a great screen view with picture clarity. However now there is no use of 4k as of now with this FHD is really lovely viewing experience. Second thing the game pad which is additional benefit that we can play games also when we get bored.

Well done Flipkart and Motorola in getting this product to the market at a affordable pricing. Mission accomplished",
            "Motorola 32\" TV just bought 1 day. it's highly recommended. It's complete Android smart TV.\nIt's come with Metal frame , Android 9 with Google assistant, IPS panel , 8 bit colour depth, 3 core GPU, 4 core CPU 64 bit, 1 GB RAM & 8 GB ROM. ITS MOST UPDATE SMART TV COMPARE TO OTHERS 32\" SMART TV IN THIS PRICE RANGE. PICTURE & SOUND QUALITY AWESOME but sound bass are low, for better bass you have to connect external woofer/speakers. PERFORMANCE IS GOOD. Only there have some connectivity issue as there have no Audio out jack available to connect external speakers/woofer however you can add/connect your external speakers/woofer via Bluetooth. 2 HDMI & 2 USB port available.\n\nRegarding delivery & installation, thanks to flipkart for delivery within 1 day . Installation done on same day.\n\none negative point that is I just forgot to add complete TV protection of 3 year & unable to add right now after several call to flipkart customer care. it's worst policy, flipkart need to expedite & should have some alternative solution may be with some post facto approval / with some additional amount need to pay by customer ect.",

            "in time delivery, same day installation and demo, happy with the product, go for it guys, over all very good smart tv, value for money, this is my first day review after using 6 hours..... thanks for flip kart and Motorola, and seller....",
            "First of all delivery and installation was on time and satisfied, however installation guys had no knowledge on seting up TV, They just fixed..turned on and bye bye\n1)Starting with the DISPLAY, its good to see when viewd from a distance, I have noticed that the brightness drops or there is a little bit of dark shade when viewed from extreme sides(colors are normal only brightness varies) but its not much issue. HD contents have very good clarity but dont expect that from normal SD quality channels, The colours are natural too.\n2)When it comes to SOUND its pretty good, one thing to note is that the speakers are not front firing (32 inch model) but down firing, sounds are very loud but don't relate loudness with quality, quality is also good enough nothing to worrry about.\n3)CONNECTIVITYis the one thing that I found a little bit low, The wifi gets disconnected some times and remote some times need 2 or 3 clicks to respond(not sure if its a perfomance issue), also it takes a bit to time to connect to bluetooth or wifi, overall conectivity is on a bit lower bound.\n4)PERFOMANCE seems to be on a balance here, can't say its a well performer or it's a mediocre perfomance. Takes around 20secs to turn on, Didn't find any lags on gaming.\none dissapointment is that it cant play contents above 1080p in YouTube and also 4k content not playable from USB (tried mx player,it just plays,but not usable)\n5)FEATURES : Please dont fall on gaming pad gimmik there is not much games to make use of, CHROMECAST is very slow and poor quality for me(dont know why,its totaly unusable),Remote mic is good enough,google assistant takes 2 sec to start hearing.\nApart from connectivity and chromecast issue everything is overall good",

Embossing the Motorola logo on some third-party cheap Chinese product and dumping them on Diwali sale is not cool. Now the shortcomings.. 1. Sound quality is poor. In all the Cable, DTH, OTT Streaming services, talking voice is very low compared to back ground sounds and music. No matter what the equalizer setting is, your music volume is suddenly too high while the talking audio is too low completely off the balance. You constantly need to have the TV remote to adjust the sound volume. 2. The LCD looks very cheap when seen in different angles. You can almost see the rainbow effect, when there is a light source hitting the surface of the screen from a specific viewing angle. 3. The 1 GB RAM definitely proves this piece of hardware is not enough equipped for the year 2020. Forget playing any games or running any apps. You can install streaming apps though. I installed Netflix, Prime Video, YouTube, Sun NXT, Hotstar which all worked fine which is a relief. I didn't even get to connect the Game Controller due to Bluetooth issues. So that's all my review. Wouldn't recommend if you can go for better models.",

Picture quality is good though some time black is not proper black maybe because of VA pannel.\n2. Sound is good and I have given 5 star then also sometimes sound cracks.\n3. I was not at all happy with the installation and the wall mounting bracket provided and installed by the engineer.

But half a way compensated with gaming joy stick. Wall mount is free where as chargeable with MI tv. Overall good to go with Moto compared with MI",

            "Actually I've ordered for exchange but Flipkart people denied due to minor scratches. Now a days Flipkart is doing worst in exchange because they're denying exchange even it has small scratches as same thing experienced in mobile phone as well.\n\nAbout Product\n\n1. Sound is too good\n2. Need more improvement on build quality because design is not attractive like showing in the image. Looks like a half baked design and feel second grade and you can't compare with LG & Samsung build quality as it's too far from this product.\n3. Video is good but able to see some big blur lines when switching from one app to another using remote dedicated key (example Netflix to YouTube OR App to DTH connection.)\n\nFinal verdict, you can also consider LG or Samsung smart TV as those also in same price range but there are not giving Gamepad. Actually I ordered this product because of Gamepad else I would go for LG or Samsung. So think twice before selecting this product.\n\nAbout Gamepad, it was connecting well 3 Times using Gamepad keys but now am unable to connect using those keys. So every time am doing Unpair and Pair.",
            "Better Than \"Mi\" Tv's........The Best Is That It Has Prime Video Support.....In Picture Quality....Sound Quality.\n... Everything...It Has Also Optical Audio Output So That High End Home Theater Are Also Supported.... Andriod 9 Is Also There....Frame Is Of....Metal....And Remote Has Dedicated Button",
            "Writing this review after using for 7 days. I was very sceptical about buying this as I was not sure about which one to choose among MI, VU and Redmi. After checking a lot of video reviews on YouTube I decided to go with this one. The delivery was fast and on the same day evening installation was done. The build quality is good with very slim bezels and the picture quality is great for a HD Ready TV. The front speakers are loud enough and much louder than others. The stock android is awesome. If you have a WiFi bring it closer to the tv or else you will face connectivity issues. I had a very old router on the next room with thick walls so I had to buy a new dual band router. Now it's working like a charm. The gaming performance is good but don't keep very high hopes with the free gamepad. It's not that good. Feels cheap. But the TV is absolutely great. Go for it. Beats Redmi and Realme in terms of sound and picture quality.",

            "The product is great and totally worth it! If you are someone who wants a smart TV for the living room for casual use, browsing Netflix, YouTube, etc with not a lot of heavy usage then go for it. Also, if your parents are going to be using the device it is very simple and easy to operate for them. My suggestion for those with SD dth connection would be to switch to HD connection for the best clarity as SD quality is not that great. Overall a good buy.",

            "Pretty much exceeds expectations in all respects. Picture quality is decent, nothing special but not bad at all. Scales SD content pretty well even when playing via old set-top box and vga connection. HD content is good enough. Colours are ok. Sound is really good. Enabling dolby and surround sound really makes a difference and does feel like a mini home theatre. However there is a slight struggle with finding the optimal setting ao that background sounds and music doesn't become too loud but dialogues are still audible. As for connectivity, no issues whatsoever. TV is located really far from wi-fi router and doesn't face any issues even with 2 closed doors in between. RAM management is good enough, apps don't lag. Response times aren't instantaneous but are good enough. All in all - great tv for the price.",

            "Perfect tv. I gave 5 stars for tv and not for flipkart service because they took 15 days for installation.But I can understand it's because of coronavirus. For tv it's IPS panel and viewing angles are perfect. Sound quality is too good. I did played game it worked fine. I didn't faced any problem with connection. Overall I think it's best tv.\n\nUpdate : It's been three months and tv is working fine. My tv remote stopped working but I mailed Motorola and they responded within 2 minutes asking for invoice bill and registered mobile number, after a day a guy came to check remote and said they will replace it within 5-6 days.\n\nUpdate: I got it replaced, they gave me new remote which is working fine. Some people said Motorola don't respond till 10-15 days but in my case they provided good service. Highly recommend tv, tv is superb.",

BEE energey rating 1 star is the biggest disappointment. it consumes 20%- 30% more electricity than LG or Samsung Tvs\n2. Major group of users are facing Connectivity issues as (a.) login issue to streaming app . After several attempt I m unable to log in at Prime (b) chromecast streaming is lagging and picture sound sync is not happening. so cant watch movies through chrome casting.\n3. Fit and finish is average, you will find gaps between plastic frame and glass panel edge\n4. Provided wall mounting frame is such that screen is projected about 200mm from wall anf looks little awakward in small room\n\nIf ypu are okay with the aboves then it is a really great Tvs. These are really good-\n1. Clear pictures\n2. sound is awesome, little bass is also there. you will love to watch youtv videos and song with clear picture and sounds.\n3. Android works well\n4. Screen mirroring with smartphone is good. you will enjoy to see old group photos, tour photos, wedding photos at home with all family member.\n5. Bluetooth remote is a relief\n6. 32inch model price is great and enough for a room or small family\n7. With 3 year warranty it is good and worry free.\n8. Juniors can play light games with gamepad\n9. I have connect with airtel hotspot and working well\n\nIf you want a TV to run with septopbox and want enjoy smartphone like feature then it is good for you. If your priority is to run TV with wifi and online streaming is your priority then spen 2-3k more go with Samsung/LG as they provide better connectivity for online streaming",

So told at customer care on call to send me a new remote, but they denied and told a service person needs to visit and check the product which is chargeable then they will send the remote. The representative came and saw the product which is already dead and without any reason I had to pay him visiting charges. He also told me that when he will come to change the remote I only have to pay the charges of the remote, no additional charges would be there. Then they called me and told the charge of remote and again I will have to pay visiting charge as he will come to change the remote and when I told that servicing person told I do not need to pay the visiting charges again, he simply denied and told I need to pay the remote charge + 2nd visiting charge.\nPlease do not buy this TV, remote and other accessories are also not available in the market, so if the product stop working, then You will have a hard time to fix it.\n\nSEE ONLINE VIDEOS, MOTOROLA TV REMOTE GIVING TROUBLE TO EVERYONE AND NO ONE IS SATISFIED WITH MOTOROLA AFTER SALE SERVICE.",

The sound quality is okay.\n3. The attached soundbar gives it a premium look.\nCons:\n1. Soundbar doesn't produce good quality audio at high volumes. Volume beyond 30% is pointless as hardly any change can be heard after that.\n2. Gamepad lags often and connectivity is a big problem.\n3. Limited RAM and storage make it difficult to play even decent quality games, forget high quality.\n\nMotorola could have done better, but I guess it had to cut some corners to sell at 20K price.

            "I was using a Sony Bravia LCD TV with Google Chromecast before this. It offered much better user control on picture and voice quality.. Bought this one as an experiment only because it has a video game setup with wireless gamepad. This is the primary feature of this TV. My 9yrs old enjoy playing games on this TV. No problem with gaming as of now.\nIn terms of TV, it certainly lags behind Sony Bravia. While there are options to change video and audio quality according to user, but it's limited. Also, as an Android TV, it performs as expected, just that it sometimes gets disconnected from Wi-Fi without a reason and shows a lag on TV remote.\nAlso, one more LOW point is that the TV hangs at times and you have no option to switch it off directly from power source. As the remote stops working.\nThe TV definitely needs a lot of improvement, if Motorola wants it to be seen as more than a limited video game for kids.\nThis review is after more than a month of usage.",

It heats up quite a bit and tends to smell. I doubt it's a manufacturing issue. Not sure how long this product willl last in the long run. But for now I am keeping distance between the wall and Tv stand just to let more airflow (no wall mount). It will be safer that way.\n\nOverall, it's a good quality product but because of the game pad, price is a little higher. And now there are better options in the market to opt for.",
