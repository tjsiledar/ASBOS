            "Its worth and just a best tv in this budget. Very good picture quality and dolby speakers are amazing sounds user friendly. Current trend android TV i will suggest to others if you want to buy big screen tv in budget level vu tv is the best choice",
            "Much awaited smart tv and I brought in the right time.. Vu Did the job at the best quality and exiting features. Speedy delivery too From flipkart.",
            "Best TV of all at that too at low price. I have done complete research on all tv. In case of images and colours like red black blue its really very awesome and brightness of the TV is 350 nits which no TV in this tange will provide. Also the Quality of sound is good. And with regards to other connectivity its connects really very fast and can easily be used hassle-free. However dont know abt the quality of parts they have used hope it would be durable good and can be used for longer period. I got my order yesterday i.e. 15 june 2020.\n\nPlease note i have also attached the images one from front angle and one from side angle. In side angle u wont see the images spread. Which in good too watch the tv even from side angle.\n\nUsually i dont comment however if something is really then that needs to commented. Really happy.",
            "Awesome picture quality. Sound is beautiful experience like sitting in theater. I use to listen songs in fresh morning. Screencast is superb. Picture quality of hd channels are very crisp and clear.\nOverall satisfied with the product \ud83d\udc4d",
            "VU tv the best in all compared to various brands.. this was the 5th TV i bought from VU (50inches to now 32 inches).. awesome experience since 2yrs.. wifi connectivity was good all user friendly features and good experience with this tv.. I recommend this tv in product performance and value for money.. Bluetooth connectivity was good. Delivered right in time specified.. Thank you Flipkart",
            "I did a lot of research before purchasing this tv. It provides stock android interface, Bluetooth 5.0, and easy to access remote keys like hotstar, youtube etc. The software gets regular updates and is easy to use. It is far more better than purchasing some chinese brand TV.",
            "Super android TV in such a excellent\n\nSuperb smart android TV such a excellent price, it's really value for money.\nSuperb picture and sound quality. Good smart features\nSmooth connectivity and screen cast is also good through crime cast features",
            "Reviewing after three months of extensive usage.\nIt's a tv which pays you for every penny. Realme is a good choice now, but I had no other choice when I was buying. But, still I think you should go with this tv just because of the reliability and trust it has made in recent past.\nAnd when it comes to buying a tv, always look out for an Android tv. You will everytime be amazed knowing how capable your television gets with an OS. And moreover, it has all the ubiquitous apps pre-installed.\nWithout being too subjective let us go through the pros and cons::\n\nPROS::\n+ Great picture quality at this price. The dark scenes are darker. Vibrant and soothing to eyes.\n\n+ Sound quality is awesome. (I had to turndown my plan of attaching a 2.1 sound system)\n\n+ Netflix actually works at 1080p :)\n\n+ Remote is detailed and user-friendly.\n\n+ Wi-Fi connectivity is flawless.\n\n+ Doesn't heat up even after 8hrs of continuous usage.\n\n\nCONS::\n\n- Chromecast is troublesome. The working is very intermittent and flaky. I am unable to cast my laptop yet. Mobile casting is less of a worry (if unlucky try to unplug the power cable and re-plug).\n\n- Some times the response time is noticeable. But yes, SOME times. This is understood at this price and the RAM it got.\n\n- Missing a microphone on remote control. Actually, I am very much used to Sony BRAVIA. But that costed me more than 1lac. But, it is obviously a trivial change to deploy and would raise the brand value.\n\nMy verdict::\n\nBeing an electronics professional, I can tell you this tv can keep you entertained for atleast 3 years. After that, if not hardware the software and OS would get obsolete for the RAM size it's equipped with. But, at this price I suggest it as a definite buy. Go for it, you won't be dissappointed. :) :)",

            "Pitcher quality is not good (compared with Motorola 32inch smart tv)\nNo dedicated app provided for Screen mirroring.\nScreen Mirroring works with internet connection only (like Google home. Etc..)\nSound quality is ok kind in this price range.\nIt was delivered on th june today is 17th june still the installation not done by jeevas team worst service by flipkart",
            "+Special Thanks to Flipkart Installation Team and Customer Care Team for keeping my request\n\n+Vale for money of course no doubt in that\n+ VU doesn't disappoint you with picture quality\n+ Dolby & DTS surround sound is giving immersive feeling\n+ Pure Android 9, no tvs own os or software.\n+ Fast connectivity\n+ Smooth, lag free and fast connectivity\n\n\n- don't have voice recognition option in remote.\n\nThey need to work on voice command for this tv model.",
            "Best one in 32 inch by premium is the bench marker of tv and thank you Flipkart ! For giving me such a great product.",
            "This is my 3rd vu tv.\nI have 55 inch for hall. 32 for my bedroom and this one i purchased for my sister.\n\nBcoz its really value for money with all features.\n\nThere are also many other local brands in lower the cost but this one is best in everything.\n\nI always recommend vu to all.",
            "Being a technology lover, you can rely on my review.\n1. PICTURE QUALITY: Just Awesome. No doubt, vu panels are one of the best.\n2. SOUND: Um. I prefer turning the dts sound off, normal sound works perfectly. Dont forget to turn the DTS-Studiosound Off.\n3. CONNECTIVITY: Works perfectly.\nWell. To be honest. Cannot expect more at this price range.\nLets see, how long this led is gonna last.\nHopes up.\n\u2665\ufe0f\nThanks VU & Flipkart.\nIt was worth the 8 days wait.",
            "Although probably not many people will come accross this review, but still going to explain anyway.\n\nThe panel is brilliant. I haven't tested other tvs in this range but I've seen high priced tv panel and this definitely holds up it's ground. Considering it's only hd ready not full hd, it's really good. Though the default settings of the tv might make you think otherwise. Remember to reduce the sharpness to only 2 or 3 for best results.\n\nThe speakers are loud enough. But it's bottom firing not front. Also the speakers has more mid range and not much low end. Means not much base or clarity. Best with a surround sound system. With dts it's amazing.\n\nWorst thing is about it is probably connectivity. In my house, in the farthest corner my phone can pick up the wifi signal with ease and without much signal loss. But this can not do that. If by chance it gets connected it can't even access internet due to massive signal loss.\n\nYou can probably buy a separate bluetooth remote with google assistant button if you need, but it's much easier to use your phone as the remote.",
            "Value for money.. picture quality is very good, but don't expect quality like sony and samsung.\nSound is awesome, you can hear pretty much wide stereo sound ..\nAnd obviously ,being an android 9.0 os tv you can enjoy all the stuffs associated with android os.\nOverall good product\nJust go for it.",
            "Happy",
            "Sound very good\nPicture quality also good\nChrome cast screen mirror good working\nGoogle assistant not working\nBluetooth not working properly\nOverall good and better than MI tv",
            "First of all I thought 43 inch looks quite bigger than 32 inch .... But once the product received i realised Nd it was like 55 inch tv. I am satisfied with the size.\n\nSecond is smooth remote and migration from one app to another nice interface.\n\nPicture is amazing wonderful panel\n\nSound is average for those who watch movies and songs\n\nBuild quality is good\n\nFinally I am unable to use Google assistant which is more important for me. That's missing.\n\nExcellent delivery and installation.",
            "1. Easy to delivery with 2 days\n2. Easy installation\n3. Picture quality awesome\n4. Sound clearly good\n5. Connectivity awesome including screen mirroring",
            "Delivery and installation was real quick (all done in single day). No issues in Connectivity, work fantastic with built-in chromecast. Only sound quality led my down, not that rich and powerful, but in this price, this TV is best.",
            "#CONNECTIVITY: PLEASE USE GOOGLE HOME APP TO CAST MOBILE AND GOOGLE CHROME CAST FEATURE TO CAST DESKTOP SO YOU WILL NOT FACE ANY CONNECTIVITY ISSUE. THE BAD REVIEWS ARE MAINLY WHO USE THIRD PARTY APPS TO CONNECT.\n\nWell it is a nice tv\nI received it in 3-4 days and also got it installed the same day.\nBut packing was not up to the mark there was not corners protection nor any flipkart packing on top of it.\nThe sound is very good (just like tv). You may see some bad reviews on sound but sound is up to the mark according to me. If you feel the sound is bad , you can turn off DTS stereo surround in settings and you can change sound effect to music or movie then it will sound better.\nRegarding connectivity: I tried both chromecast to mirror laptop and google home app for mirroring android screen and i not received any problem. I think people who write bad review on connectivity might be using a third party app. And yes bluetooth is there in 32US model . It is in the settings by name remote and accessories",
            "VU tv is the best to have in our home. This is my second order for this brand. Best quality in affordable amount.",
            "Really amazing purchase. I have researched a lot before buying it. But now I can say that you won't be able to differentiate picture quality with Sony tv without close watch. Picture quality us really good. Smart tv features are also very good. One demerit is voice assistance button is not available in remote but voice assistance feature can be availed by installing android remote app in your mobile phone. Many here are counting many demerits but one this I can tell you even if you buy a Sony Tv for 50k you will also face some issue in that tv. I got it for 19,000/- after credit card discount during sale.",
            "This tv is amazing and the picture quality is super amazing , sounds great and connectivity very fast and smooth.this is my second vu tv first I bought vu premium 43 inch in March and vu premium 32 inch now in August both are wonderful.\nUse Google Home app for fast Chromecast and Google Android tv remote app for Google assistance voice commands. No need voice commands remote.\nGo for it for VU TV.",
            "This tv ia amazing ? ?\n1) Picture :-Brilliant picture quality . You can see it's screen in Bright sunshine easily.\n2)sound :- Real Dolby sound . It creates a good quality sound and very high volume . It has Dolby digital Plus , Dolby audio , and an aussum studio sound . Sound is very clear in it and it's full volume is mind blowing.\n3) Connectivity:-Very smooth connectivity to wifi and lan .\n4) value of money :-It is perfect tv and value of money.\nYou will love this tv.\nBuy this tv only .",
            "It was a pleasant experience. Order was delivered on the same day it was mentioned. Took 72 hours to get it installed. Fine in this Corona times. Quality seems good at the end of a week use. 3 year extended warranty is a wise choice, it seems. Rated 5*s.",
            "Truly satisfied with the product. Picture quality is top notch and sound is also quite good but lacks in low pitches and in base otherwise its a decent speakers.

Due to covid, it was not available for so long, once its deliverable, i ordered it immediately.\n\nPicture is very good (for this prices), internet items like YouTube, Netflix, Prime, etc,. are really good in visuals. For cables, use HD box and HD channels to get the full utilization for picture quality.\n\nSound: if you have a closed room then the TV sound is good and clear, otherwise u need to have full volume when u use Netflix or prime. For YouTube, sound is clear and low volume is enough. For cables, you can adjust both the volume for your requirement. For Netflix and Prime, I would just either use sound bar or home theatre or Bluetooth headphones if you have windows in the room where you keep the TV.\n\nConnectivity of the Bluetooth devices might be a problem. It works without any issue but every time u need to pair the device with TV.\n\nFor casting or mirroring phone u need a app to be installed, that another manual work which we need to go through.\n\nBuy a HD TV stabilizer, if you're buying smart tv for first time, otherwise old stabilizer will be useless for smart TV.\n\nAs of now its good and I'll update after 6 months.",

The apps won't open immediately. 1st of all its take too much time to go from one app to another app. I am not understanding why this TV got disconnecting from WiFi again and again many times in a day when my phone and laptop still connected with WiFi. The picture is good. But u cant enjoy the sound as can't listen the dialogues because the Re-recording dominates. God only should know What kind sound system it has. While u operating this TV u get two kind of thoughts. One is, you feel that better to switch off the tv and watch some funny videos in phone to get piece. Second one is just break the TV and buy a new one. So... Still you want to buy TV??",

            "I researched a lot before buying a 32 inch smart tv. I do not regret buying this tv. But surely the sound quality is a quite an issue. When there is a high background music like in an action scene, the sound volume goes up, but where there is a conversation between characters, the sound volume is too low to hear, and you cannot go too up otherwise in next scene if there is a hard music, volume would go crazy. Such a weird problem with this tv. Vu really needs to figure out this issue, the sound has to be adaptive and not uncertain between channels to channels and scene to scene. I would really request you to research a bit before going for this option.",

I mean, it's fine till it hits about 40% and that is actually pretty loud, but then what is the need for the sound till 100%? it's totally distorted.. like with full of noise.. so yeah.. 4.5 it is for me.. will update on service and stuff if anything comes up.",

            "The VU 43 Inch full HD LED TV is exactly as described and total value for money. Have been using the product for about two weeks now and have been fully satisfied.\n\nPros\n\n* Value for money.\n* All apps that are routinely available and required for a smart TV can be installed.\n* Self installation is easy if setting up on a table top.\n* Decent connectivity with two USB ports and two HDMI ports (including one ARC) which am using to connect to my home theatre system.\n\nCons\n\n* Not related to the product but support from Flipkart. It has been two weeks since the product has been delivered and the promised free installation is yet to materialise. Speaks poor of the support. I am not sure if warranty issues too would be poor too.\n\n* There is a slight initial lag in starting any app immediately when the TV is switched on. Once it stabilizes, there are absolutely no issues at all. Just a minor issue and not really a problem especially considering it's almost half the price of brands like Sony.\n\nOverall, fully satisfied till date except for the installation part which is yet to happen.",

May be this is expected for an Android OS TV with less RAM.\nSetting up of Apps takes time at the first try because of slowness.\nWithin few days my Dad asked me to authenticate to Prime Video again as somehow App got reset losing data. Again, not a big deal once or twice but this can't keep happening. Hopefully it doesn't.\n\nOverall a good TV for a small family or a small room.\nI was also looking for Infinix which was launched while I bought this TV. Infinix has more or less same features and at 3K less price point but since it is first time Infinix released TV we didn't want to take chance. Moreover we already had 55\" VU TV bought few years back which is working perfectly and hence we voted for VU.",

I request the company to look into this matter, and if this problem can be rectified through a firmware update do it immediately.

It gives a amazing picture and sound quality.\nI have just tried installing Android game and tried playing. It was also amazing. We can feel the graphics in that game and it works smoothly.\n\nI issues that I faced with this TV is the connectivity of mobile and TV with cast option.

            "Excellent picture clarity, the right size for a medium sized room, clear and loud sound, enough connectivity and free wall bracket these are the highlights of the TV. Whatever you look for in a new premium TV you'll find in this one. I bought the 43 inch version, it is full high definition, it is an Android TV, it supports all the various OTT platforms, can play any movie you throw at it, has a full form Bluetooth remote and everything you want in a TV like this.\nHowever everything is not perfect. It is not a voice remote and you will want one once you have a TV like this. in the cover of the TV it says it supports Google Assistant, however I was unable to make it function. It could be my problem. I also noticed that Amazon prime has lesser volume than other OTT platforms like YouTube. I have some Anime with 8-bit and 10-bit encoding and the native player could not work it, but once I downloaded MX Player, it ran smooth enough.\nThe TV arrived within 2 days and installation happened the very next day which was professionally and neatly done.the TV was wall mounted perfectly with the wall bracket that came with the packet. It is always better to buy a TV from Flipkart especially during these times. Flipkart and Vu is the perfect choice.\nA side note: Once you buy a TV, never look for TV's or TV advertisements in any platform because you are going to get depressed. Right after I bought VU premium TV I was inundated with VU Cinema TV and the new cheaper Oneplus TV. I am not unhappy with my purchase, because this was the right choice for me at this price point as both the TVs I mentioned were higher priced. I paid an extra 1500 for extra 2 years of warranty. And don't forget an apt Voltage Stabiliser that you have to buy.\nMy final verdict: Buy it, you won't regret, I love the theatre experience with the big bright screen and the loud 24 watt speaker volume. It is always better to buy a full high definition TV or 4K even though it might consume more power, in the end, you will be more satisfied with the brilliant picture.",

VU tv delivered on time by Flipkart thanks to Flipkart service..\n5.For installation I have called them 4-5 times then the technician came n installed the tv. But not gave proper tv features in detailed I have disappointed with that.\n6.overall it\u2019s a budget smart tv under Rs 12k , if your affordable I would suggest to buy full HD tv or you can go for 4K tv.. For better experience on picture.\n7.for connectivity - 2 Hdmi & 2 usb -that\u2019s good features.\n\nOverall my rating for tv:\nPicture quality ***\nSound quality **\nSmooth Android 9 ***\nConnectivity. ***\nRemote ***",
