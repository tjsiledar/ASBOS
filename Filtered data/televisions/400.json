            "It's really amazing choice...Thanks to samsung. I choose installation with samsung by help of customer care and it worked superb for me. This tv features are really amazing..the multi view, pc mode, ambient and art mode....many many more. If you have a proper hd content to watch..one of the best screens with 120 hz refresh.",
            "TV is fairly nice. The 43 inch is a bit different from other sizes in few aspects. The major one being, you wont get the no gap wall mount. Instead there are 2 very small and sleek wall mounts. That made the whole installation process a big hassle. The Jeeves executive was also surprised to see that wall mount and it took him approx. 30-45 min. to mount the TV. However, once installed, TV looks flushed inside the wall. But still, Samsung could have provided a no gap wall mount with smaller sized TV.\n\nIn 43 inch, you wont get the 120hz or VRR. So, if you are looking for a TV for your new Xbox/PS, better go for 55inch or higher. If you have an older Xbox/PS, they work very nice with the help of game mode. Picture quality and sound is good. No complaints on that. Streaming Netflix/Amazon/YouTube is very nice. In some places, Black or dark scenesdoes not come out to be that nice. But it is bearable.\n\nIts USP is the art mode. And it justifies it. It do looks like an art piece. You would only get limited no. of pieces. However, I am not able to access those free artworks even after signing into samsung account. Help me out in this. But, you can add your own photos through smart things app.\n\nAll in all, TV is very good, except for the installation process.",
            "Art mode is a great feature and it's an add on for your leaving room..Very good display.. colors are really pop out and looks amazing. Intelligent mode works quite well. 40 watt sound is good enough. Tizen OS is very smooth and all the apps work well. Looks really great on the wall..\nInternal storage is 6 GB and it's enough..",
            "The tv was delivered to me within 2 days but the installation didn't happen for 5 days and i had to call flipkart and Samsung several times for the installation and then it happened, so i am really disappointed at that front. As for the tv, i found it ok, i was expecting a quality lile oled but that's my fault otherwise pics and videos are good vibrant but i highly suggest you invest in a decent soundbar.\n\nAlso the offer included a free magnetic bezel worth 9900/- but flipkart is very very reluctant to honor that offer, i called the flipkart support for almost a month and more than 10 calls and Finally it got delivered after almost one Month of buying the tv and that too after my constant call to them.

No lag\n- Super thin display with an additional One Connect Box\n\nCons:\n- Average sound quality with low volume levels\n- No support for Jio TV and very few apps available compared to an Android TV\n\nNote: Remote reception is on One Connect Box. So if you keep the box inside the cupboard or somewhere far, it will affect the responsiveness of the remote.",
            "Samsung is the pioneer of QLED tech and their QLED panels are borrowed by all other TV manufacturers. But when you compare the picture quality Samsung TVs have the edge over other brands. Like everyone I did a lot of research and came to know that Samsung is way above TCL, Mi, IFalcon, Hisense and 1+. The only let down is the refresh rate given to 50 inch tele. 60hz refresh rate if absolutely fine but could have been amazing if it had 120hz refresh like 55 & 65 inch models. Brightness is easi...\nREAD MORE",
            "Awesome product from Samsung. Great picture quality and sound is good. The art mode is simply super. Only issue I faced was that I had to follow-up multiple times with flipkart on the free bezel. Other than that I don't think I have any other issues from the past 3 months that I have been using it. It may be pricier than other QLED tvs but trust me, it's worth it.",

It is included in the package but not mentioned.\n2. Installation not performed by Samsung\n3. Third party vendor was slow. Less communicative.\n4. Third party vendor was slightly unaware of installation procedure. Here Samsung is to blame, due to their highly complex 2 piece wall mount which is difficult to balance. Install...\nREAD MORE",

            "The best QLED under 1 lakh in India.\n\nPros:\n\n1. Excellent color reproduction (change default settings though)\n2. 120 hz support, but the screen response time is like 11-12 ms so some ghosting is visible, but that's still better than 30 ms or above in most panels.\n3. Sound is decent, although I have hooked it up to a JBL soundbar.\n4. Frame functionality is very good. Recommend that you buy the free bezels that are available online.\n\nCons:\n1. Artpieces are paid with the monthly plan that is quite steep.\n2. Mounting it is a hassle with regular tv wall mounts.\n3. Google assistant is a pain to set up and doesn't work half the time.\n4. App selection is very limited compared to Android TV.",

The display of the TV is also good but I think there are even better displays out there in the same price range.\n\nThe installation team is also worth a mention as he was very helpful and the service offered was awesome.\n\nThe only downside of this TV which I felt was is its speaker. I bought the 50 inch variant and the speaker was 20W, this is not a bad speaker at all but after paying more than 70k for a TV we would expect a bit mo...\nREAD MORE",

            "Samsung The Frame TV has perfect colours/contrast and the blacks are also deep and accurate... 40 watt speakers are well balanced for optimal output... MEMC software needs little improvement and the Greys need little balancing but overall the TV has got amazing picture video quality....",
            "This tv hardware is no doubt its one of the best but only con its operating system tizen os it's lacks in 3rd party apps u can't sideload any apps outside of it's app store which Is a big con compared to Sony or any Android TV...Samsung should adopt to Android TV or atleast give us options to hv Google play store or shld give us options to install apps out side of appstore of tizen os.\nEven samsung's own samsung TV plus freezes now & then\nSony liv apps has some issues with in even good network speed like 50mbps it showed poor quality video like 720p only not 1080p always or apps from tizen os doesn't hv options to forced it apps to stream 1080p only like apps from from apps store of fire stick sometimes during live matches.\nFlipkart delivery is good & super fast",
            "One of the major reason for buying this unit was it's aesthetics. While the unit is sleek and sits petty well to the wall but the picture art availability is a disappointment. After shelling out 75k we have got only 1 default option, for additional artworks one has to buy them from the app. Add to that, for additional frames, one has to shell out 6-7k .\nOther than that, samsung delivers nicely in terms of conventional parameters - sound, display etc. Interface is also quite good and easy. Remote style is quite refreshing.\nAlthough more options could have been provided for pre-loaded apps.",

Motion sensor is very weak we need to stand in front of Tv for 1-2 secs then Frame wakes up from sleep mode remotve is also very slow it is very laggy.
