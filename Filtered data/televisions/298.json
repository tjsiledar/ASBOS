            "It has much brighter colours..i was using samsung smart 4k ultra hd, the picture quality which i had experienced in samsung tv is different than this kodak tv coz my new tv picture quality is little less than my old tv. Kodak tv render the much dynamic colors and no pure clarity.\n\nAs android tv rest every thing is good. Google assistant is my favourite thing in it. We can download interesting apps and enjoy.speakers are also fine but if connected with 2.1 bar speakers that would be a treat to our living area and to our ears. Moreover this tv operates in android 9 and is capable of speedy performance and i like its User Interface (UI).

            "Love the TV it been a week and yes enjoying the watching it.. Very worth for money.. Thank you flipkart and kodax for beautiful TV and installation in less time.",
            "Good at the price point.\nCons first\nA lot of people have mentioned about remote not working and that is truly the case. The remote does get unpaired and stops working. Without an input to the tv, u realy are stuck as the bottom buttons don't have an ok input but only power on and off and volume control so u can't pair a new device or remote without it. Simple workaround - when it arrives, pair ur smartphones with the tv (lot of apps on app store but none from kodak for this like mi and that is sad) so when the remote stops working, just unpair and pair it again using ur smartphones and it starts working again. It is really annoying otherwise. (Happens once a week to ten days with my tv, might be more or less with others)\nSound\nNot good not bad. Clarity is good for shows and movies but if u enjoy music, get a soundbar.\nPros\nGood display\nAndroid apps\nVery cheap for a 43inch uhd ( got it for 19250 during BBD with all card offers clubbed)",
            "It's a good value for money also the most affordable 4k Tv in the price segment. Slim baseles, great picture quality.\nDelivery of this tv was on time. Installation is also done professionally. Being a online media consumer the only down side is it doesn't support Netflix.",
            "Really liked the product quality. It's far better than its rivals at this price point. KODAK has done an excellent job in packaging this fabulous product at this price point, an excellent 4K smart tv.",
            "My Kodak led is very nice much better love it",
            "Thank you kodak family.Iit's Very nice sound and best picture quality of this product ..we like it most .but one thing is that the wall mount clip is very poor quality..all most ok ..thank you one's again kodak tv family.",
            "Awesome Product must buy.\nPretty decent service provided by Kotak and FK guy, loved it and recommended to everyone.",
            "No complaints about the picture quality. Could have been better but I think I am fairly satisfied at this price.\n\nSound is ok but you might want to get a speaker if you are using it in a big hall.\n\nBluetooth connectivity is poor even at a distance of 6-7 ft.\n\nApp support is fine but can't install Netflix.",
            "Very nice pictures quality....Very low cost best quality led tv..Kodak is the best Brand for LED TV",
            "Happy with Kodak TV performance. Picture quality is amazing. Sound is good. Bluetooth Connectivity is fast and remote works good.\nIf you compare it with other TV's in this range, Kodak comes as a valuable package.\nCon:\nDoes not support Netflix.\nHDMI port is on the back side of TV and if you are doing wall mount, uu will have difficulty using it.\nBluetooth range is low and hence, you can't use it if you try to connect your headphone and sit at a distance.\nThe installation guy was worse, he spoiled my wall using his driller and later blamed the wall for not letting him drill and left. (He did try to sell me some wall mount worth INR 2k before leaving though). I then called a local technician and he was able to install the TV easily without any mess.\nThe only reason I had to wait for installation for 4 days because Flipkart has this shitty policy that the warranty or return can only be claimed, if the product is installed by their authorised technician",
            "Kodak 7x pro very nice led wajib prize good sound good picture quality good service prize money I am happy thanks Kodak product and Flipkart",
            "such a good Android 4K tv with inbuilt chromecast . delivery and installation also up to the mark. A branded tv like LG/SONY/SAMSUNG , and good to see that it is Made in india. Dont think more. Just go for it",

            "The product is reasonably priced and am happy with the features. In the subsequent models I request Kodak Team to work on Sound Output by providing an option for higher watt Speakers.",
            "Best Android TV at this cost. Best sound , Best Picture quality. Happy buyer.",
            "Awesome clarity and sound.. Best value for money TV... It has almost all the apps inbuilt and the 4k videos are worth watching.. Best tv in the market for this price...\nThe demo and installation was done before the expected date.",
            "It's perfect for the price paid. Good picture quality, the blacks aren't deep and needs some adjustment before you hit the sweet spot. I only use internet based apps so the picture resolution is good. Another great thing is the presence of 3.5 mm jack or the Aux port or the headphones jack to which I connect my old Sony speakers so sound quality is no more an issue. The newer models these days do not come with this aux-in port since the sound bars and all connect via hdmi or arc or optical port. So if you have an old set of speakers which only connect via the headphones jack, make sure your TV has that. Coming to build quality, it's pretty flimsy and have to be real careful with it, basically u're getting what you paid for.\nI wanted a TV which will hold good for atleast 2 years so let's see how far this one goes. Overall I'd say I'm pretty satisfied with this purchase. Thanks to Flipkart and Kodak.",
            "This LED Tv is Awesome.The only trouble i faced in the the installation process with the installation guy.He was very rude and not installed my TV properly i complaint on flipkart as well but didn't receive any proper response.The picture quality is Amazing ...sound quality needs to improve but it sufficient..overall an excellent package in this price range.I am totally satisfied with the product",
            "this is the second time i am purchsing KODAK tv prior was 55ca series , which is super fine and working wonderfully , and this ismy second purchase , i absolutely have no problem with kodak , i see the price is very less than other brands and quality is super good , i am a happy customer choosing KODAK",
            "It's very amazing tv in deserving budget, sound, picture, connectivity quality is awesome. I suggest to everyone if they buy smart tv it's \u092a\u0948\u0938\u093e \u0935\u0938\u0942\u0932 don't think another brand.\nI'm happy with Kodak & this brand",

            "Tv has great colors, sound, clarity, etc. Everything is fine however there are minor enhancements required for this TV to be the best in its class.\n1. It should support Netflix out of the box. Right now it is not supported, upon talking to helpline they said to use netflix mobile version APK to be installed in TV using pendrive.\n2. It doesn't support any well known browser which you can use to browse netflix web, history web, etc.\nYou can't download chrome, firefox, microsoft edge or netflix even from playstore as they are not supported in this TV.\n\nNote: you can use puffin TV browser for browsing however you still can't run History or Netflix, etc on it.",
            "The Product is Excellent ...\n*No 43\" 4K TV is available in this range\n*As my set top box is sd there is slight distribution of pixels and not all channels in same visibility but better the Old tv\n* Smart TV with android features\n* Loved the remote very impressive and easy to use.\n* I got an Extra discount using SBI Credit Card\n* People who want a budget 4k TV below 25 K , I prefer this\n* One disadvantage is the stands used to install on table are plastic so should be careful while handling.",
