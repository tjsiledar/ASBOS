            "Splendid product, nice installation system within few hours, vibrant colours filled with nature like pigments.\nThanks# Samsung India ,# Flipkart.",
            "Beautiful tv.... Amazing quality. This Qled 55 inch in this range is the best option for people who are wanting the latest qled and hdmi technology.\nGo for it.",
            "The Frame- as the name suggests is more for as a decor than being a TV. You can get a better configuration TV at a cheaper price but this one has an edge due to its aesthetics.\nIn standby mode the image gallery gives a look as if an art piece is hanging on a wall. The wallpaper can be put in a slideshow and it keeps on changing.\nOne Connect is another feature which makes this TV almost wire free. Due to its zero space stand the Frame almost attaches to the wall without any gap.",
            "Writing this after just 3 days of usage.\n\nThe Frame TV stays true to its title. The art mode really gives a feel of having a real high quality painting hanging on your wall\n\nPros\n- Picture Quality : The movies look amazing on the TV. The picture produced looks almost real .Even the quality with Tata sky is good\n-Sound: Better than what you would expect from a TV. Slight base too gives an additional zing.Although ,I have to keep the sound level above 60 mostly.The TV is not so loud even at full volume.\n- Art Mode : This is what you should buy the TV for. Don't forget to avail the 3 months free subscription\n- Remote : Minimal and feels premium to hold (Except the volume and channel button which are slightly flimsy)\n-Ambient Mode : Music visualizer is a cool feature\n- You can install the most popular apps\n- Tizen OS : Runs super fast and smooth on the tv\n\nCons\n- Universal remote is a little buggy with Tata Sky with back function not working and some more issues\n- Bixby is not the best voice assistant out there.Takes 2/3 narrations to do what i am asking it to do\n-Art mode doesn't have a slideshow mode (or I couldn't find it)\n-App store still is not as rich as android tv\n\nOther Observations\n- No indication on one connect box whether its on or off\n- The engineer is more scared than you to handle the one connect cable\n\nOverall , If you are looking for a new TV in this price range,This will give you the most differentiated experience\n\n& Impress your guests with the art mode\n\nWell done Samsung !",
            "Excellent TV for the price we opted for the 50\" as the viewing distance was comfortable for us,At first i thought the 50\" wont be as good as 55\" but to my surprise it is fantastic as the volume is sufficient for the room consideration 20w viewing angles are great using this TV for 1 month and can definitely say worth the buy rather than LG & Sony in this range as they won't offer Qled at this price & their Oled's are more than 1L,The 4k looks excellent with major OTT platforms (Netflix, Amazon prime,Hotstar) Ai upscaling is also great1080p is also great dosent look like a downgrade at all.Also the concept of no gap wall mount is awesome which generally no other companies offer whic looks cool as there is negligible gap between tv and wall which offer much cleaner looking Fame look to your TV.Just go for it you won't regret.\ud83d\udc4d",
            "This is the first high-value product I have brought online and this TV is amazing.\n\nPros:\n-Awesome Display\n-Awesome Flipkart and Samsung Installation service.\n-Amazing Audio Quality. Thank god it has a 40W speaker for 55inch. I would recommend going with 40W speaker TV.\n\nCons:\n-It's costly. as per the concept of FRAME TV, I don't think in India it will help unless you have a big wall with many frames and I don't think so anyone would keep the TV switch on while leaving home or sleeping for Art Display.\n-It's Frame TV without giving Frame and there is no way to find a Frame online in India, not on Flipkart or on Samsung site.\n\nIf you find similar tv with the same specifications at a lower price, it's worth thinking about.\n\nGiving 5 Stars rating for the Audio, Display quality, and Service of the Flipkart.",
            "I got this only for my PS5. QLED and 120Hz Refresh Rate were my major reasons to choose this TV and now super happy with my purchase. Crystal clear visuals and butter smooth gameplay. Also watching movies feel like being infront of a theatre because of its booming speakers. Trust me you wont require any external speakers for this TV. Blindly go for it. \u2764",
            "Excellent buy, value for money. If you are looking for a tv in the 75-90k budget, then samsung frame is the best choice right now. The most value for money tv, no other brand comes close in this price sector. The frame concept is excellent but even without it, the TV stands high on its picture and performance. The Tizen os is a bit laggy but besides that this is the best tv to buy, the 55 inch version is most aggressively priced and should be the one to be bought. :)",
            "The frame experience hanging on the wall is great.\nGood quality material, high clarity picture display, ease of operation, good sound output, best part is just one single wire to the TV and there is no clutter of wires... Awesome",
            "Gift for my parents and Good product must buy. But in my area it is first TV no other have and installation person was also new for that. I don't know whether he installed properly or not. As TV say no gap wall mounting but gap is there. Samsung has to Verify the installation once. Request please forward to Samsung. Thank you.",
