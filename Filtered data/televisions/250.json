HDR format settings are not available in picture settings, but it is automatically switching to HDR format (HDR day / HDR night / HDR dynamic) when I play 4K HDR / 4K Dolby vision supported movies from Netflix / i tunes, and it is supporting HDR 10 format upto 50 Hz. If you love watching movies, then go for it. I personally feel I am getting more than what I paid for, and MARQ may increase the price once this item becomes more popular.\nCons, I noticed a small black bar, in some 4K scenes, horizontally while fiddling with some settings, but it disappeared when I turned TV off and on.

            "it looks good slim and stylish sound quality is awesome picture quality is good using fr last one week. marq service is good. YouTube and Netflix clarity is super. wifi is also good. cast screen working for some mobiles only. Lenovo k8 plus not supported for screen cast. amazon prime also not working. but in this price range quality of picture sound and other smart features are good. if it's durable then it's excellent in this price range and quality. after few days of usage I will rewrite my review.",
            "Value for Money for sure. you won't get a product packed with so many features at 10K mark. Picture quality is superb. Sound is loud enough for a 150SqFt room. Super quick delivery and installation by Flipkart and Jeeves respectively - within 24 hours of order placement.\n\nFew issues with connectiviity though. Here are few cons that I have been encountering after a week's usage.\n1. WiFi connection takes time. couple times it took more than 3 minutes for the TV to get connected to WiFi. I checked and it wasn't an issue with my router.\n2. You can't download softwares on the TV. This is not an android TV. There are other versions of MarQ that are full Smart TVs.\n3. No way to cast your phone. the built-in software (Aircast Live) is no more available for download on your phone as the company is no more in business.\n\nOverall I am satisfied with the performance. Netflix and YouTube work exceptionally well. haven't tried connecting external devices through HDMI or USB.\n\nFinal Verdict - If you are going to view DTH / Cable programs on the TV primarily with minimal usage of SMART features, go for it without a doubt.",

            "absolute value for money .. sound quality is great .\ntotally satisfying... but if u are looking for real smart TV then u should go for another option because it is not a Android TV .. means it not support hotstar Amazon prime or any third party application.. you can only use YouTube or Netflix which is induild",

            "pros:\n-Mind blowing picture quality. being a VA panel, it has deep blacks making watching movies a great experience. Play the right 4k video on YouTube or Netflix and you'll be transported into the scene by the colors and details. it's a smart TV not Android TV but I didn't go for the Android TV as it has IPS panel which is good for gaming but doesn't give the best blacks.\n- Excellent sound. Different modes of sound available like speech, night, theater which really have an impact.\n- HDR looks great on Netflix\n\ncons:\n- no audio search in remote\n- connectivity issue in Netflix. whenever TV wakes up from sleep, Netflix doesn't always work even though internet shows connected. requires tv to be powered off and turned on again.\n- limited apps\n\nThis is a tv meant for watching good content and in that front, it's the best out there no doubt. but it does lack features which make life easier. using the remote to search is a pain. and some bugs present in apps. a firestick should solve all these problems if needed. if lots of apps and ease of use is a priority, go for the Android version of the same tv but you will be sacrificing picture quality as it's a IPS panel.\n\noverall, a 4k tv for less than 35k , I can't help but give it a full 5 stars.",
            "Absolutely Great.\nDecent picture quality better than the Mi TV. Sound quality is the best in this range. YouTube, Netflix all work flauntlesly. If you wanna buy it, buy it without a hitch.",
            "just bought this for my friend . He is happy with picture sound n quality of tv. service was also good . overall best in its price range",
            "Not as expected. Wifi is showing very low network even though all other devices run smoothly in my room.. Cant connect to youtube,.. Luckily I have Amazon fire stick which works very well.. Audio is horrible.. 1 is very low 2 is medium 8 is max and its same after that till 100.. So i connected my bluethooth speakers on Amazon fire stick to resolve that.. So its just a bad basic 43 inch tv for me.. not a smart tv, no audio (i am not using tv speakers, its irritating) .. I would not recommend this to anyone.. Disappointed.. I bought this even after reading all these similar reviews.. That's a bad decision on my part..",

            "Not up to the mark as per the promise by flipkart. Most of the apps are not working most of them are paid download apps are not supportive. and the technicians also not so cool. How to watch sports particularly cricket not supporting zee and Hotstar. Not able to connect home theatre this is the worst part and no support from flipkart.",

            "picture quality is superb and if you connect it with 5.1 or something like Sony speakers then it's worth else it's a normal TV . Second most important thing is cast, unfortunately it only supports Netflix and youtube casting that's it , you can cast hotstar or any other applications. ( HDMI cable is only hope , and it works good for me )",

            "Excellent value for money. Good screen resolution. Nice look. But sound doesn't look OK. Sound doesn't increase after a certain level. My earlier TV has 12 watts speakers and they were much louder.\n\nOverall its a good TV. I personally recommend this TV.",

            "Lovely Tv Marq by Flipkart value for money spend....Only problem i faced was installation and demo as after receiving the TV on 12th November installation and demo was done on 18th November. Customer service girl from flipkart helped a lot in follow up till installation thanks for her. The engineer did the installation and demo very nicely ...... over all experience was good little follow up was needed. I always shop from flipkart they are good in delivering plus affordable price goods they provide. thanks flipkart.",
            "I bought the Tv for 10k ...It's the best available smart tv at this price....screen casting is superb...nice quality ...Go for it ...Better Wifi connectivity ..The Tv remote is good compared to the Mi Tv...",
            "First of all personally thank flipkart for extending delivery of this product to interior areas. Coming to the product, Valued product for the given money. Dolby is not good but a small difference was observed than ordinary led tv. YouTube n Netflix r working great. For better sound compulsory we need a sound bar.",
            "wow what a tv excellent awesome display great picture quality wonderful sound superb connectivity best price fantastic features. totally worth it.",
            "I think anyone can go buy a led TV from marq at this range n experience the Dolby digital sound with a HD ready screen resolution along side a perfect finish for a perfect look. Flipkart delivery is so quick n within time things done which are promised. thanks to flipkart.",
            "Good product and worth the value.... Amazing clarity and sound....",
            "Purchased from Flipkart after extensive research. Had some doubts about brand and service network. Called up Marq call centre to confirm presence of service centre in my city.\nOn time delivery and prompt installation provided by Flipkart. Now coming to the TV unit ...\nPros\n1. A+ Grade Full HD Screen\n2. Multiple Connectivity Options\n3. Screen Mirroring from Mobile\n4. Slim, non-protrusive bezels\n5. Good inbuilt speakers with Dolby Digital\n6. Good Refresh Rate and Contrast Ratio\nCons\n1. Not many useful apps in app-store\n2. Poor browser\n3. Only YouTube and Netflix are pre-installed apps\nOverall very value-for-money purchase. Totally recommended.",
            "Good TV for the pricing. There are some screenbleeding/light glow issues when the viewing angle goes more than the recommended one. For that you have to adjust the contrast and brightness.\n\nIt's only a smart tv and not a Android TV (just to include it here) you don't get playstore, you cannot sideload apps. Justifies the price though.\n\nYou can watch YouTube and NetFlix, but you cannot watch PrimeVideos and not even Hotstar as that isn't supported even by the browser it has.\n\nApp store has limited apps which aren't useful in our daily life usage.\n\nWhat is the use of this, For this price range, you get a good big screen with good in-built speakers which is quite loud and clear.\n\nYou can connect this TV through WiFi, Ethernet, and also with your wireless mouse or keyboard (only which has Wi-Fi adapter).\n\nThe panel as per my knowledge, It looks like a VA panel to me. Though only A+ panel has been mentioned, so I can't really tell.\n\nBut, VA panel is what I think it is.\nThe colors are good, Blacks are also good.\nAnd if you watch it with proper viewing angle (right in-front of the TV) then you can experience deep blacks as if you are using a big sized smartphone with Super AMOLED display. When we move to a bit off side then we can see the blacks decreasing and slowly starting to appear dark grey and medium grey (at more extended side view).\n\nColors also fade from side view because of low viewing angle.\nIt's not a IPS panel, So it is understandable.\n\nGood for houses which has 4-5 people's who can site in front the TV on a sofa.\n\nTip: Keep this TV in the center wall of your hall or bedroom to actually enjoy the richness of this TV.",
            "tv itself is good.. but no one thinks or no one knows that they didnt gave any aux port... then how can u connect speakers or home theaters to tv.... u should see tv through tv volume only like a bafoon... ..pls pls my request to every one is while buying tv pls check the specifications clearly whether they have provided aux port to tv or not... if they dont.... dnt buy that kinf of bafoon tvs.... u cant connect any home theaters to tv...",
            "its best tv on this range. nice pictures quality sound and net connectivity is awesome. product delivery is on time after ,10 min of delivery demo engineer called me and within 30 min he was in my home. thnks Flipkart to made ka best product and uour trustable brad marq by Flipkart",
            "Picture - Sacrifice viewing angles for contrast. VA panel gives you better Black reproduction than IPS panels. Do not tap on the screen while the TV is on. It causes white flashes. Not sure if that would damage the LED's in any way. So avoid doing that.\n\nSound - I've got my TV hooked up to a Yamaha Home Theatre. The TV's stand alone 20 Watt speakers are good when i switch to Netflix or YouTube. However, I cant seem to get the home theatre to work when Netflix or YouTube is on.\n\nNavigation - Its a pain typing something in the search bar when using Netflix or YouTube.\nLinux OS is pretty smooth and crisp. Somehow, I am yet to figure out how the Tv is able to control my Yamaha Home theatre. I just turn on the Tv and it turns on my home theatre intuitively. If its a planned feature by Marq then its pretty damn smart i must say !!!\nDedicated buttons for Netflix and YouTube on the remote is quite handy.\n\nBuild Quality - Don't need anything better than what's offered my Marq. Its worth every penny.\n\nDelivery by Flipkart - As usual - Before time. Delivery guys ensured that my tv wasnt damaged in transit. A thorough check was done and feedback taken immediately on delivery site.\nInstallation - A day before the scheduled date. It would have been installed on the same day if the engineer hadn't been held up with another client. That's completely understandable. The engineer took a while to figure out the wall mount mechanism. But with a little brainstorming, we managed to get it done. (The wall mount has to be off-center by 2 inches for this tv.)\nOverall experience 10 days since - Pleased to the point that I would recommend the brand - both Marq and Flipkart.\n\nCheers!",
            "For the price it's one of the best led television in the market. Plus a e-commerce giant like flipkart who's the manufacturer it makes it more reliable then the Chinese brands available out there. Hope it meets up to its expectations.",
            "Wonderful piece of beauty and yes the main Pros goes to its Dolby Speakers.\nThe Resolution is Crisp with vivid colours. Panel looks Durable, sleek and sturdy.\nJust a thing to improve could be with it's operating system. So guys let me clear it out, Yes the Product mentions that it's a Smart TV but to be honest, it not an actual smart TV, it's not an Android TV rather ways. You can just connect your WiFi which can be connected to a couple of pre loaded apps like YouTube and Netflix, cast your screen, That's all you get in this Smart TV. But on the other hand considering the Price for what you pay I don't think you'll get anything better than this.\nThe Wall Mounting is already included whereas you have to pay \u20b9500 extra in case of Mi Tv's.\nOverall good product by MarQ Flipkart. Value for Money",
            "Here are my initial impressions of my recent purchase of Flipkart Marq 55 inches TV.\nI was not in market for a new TV. I have an 40 inch AOC TV which has served me faithfully and has excellent picture quality.\nHowever, while surfing Flipkart site during recent sale, I came across this TV and was interested. Additional 2 years warranty sealed the deal.\nI chose this non-android TV as Official Android TV is still work in development & doesn\u2019t support many apps yet.\nThis TV supports a VEWD App store, which provides few HTML5 based apps including Netflix and youtube. When paired with good Android TV box with minimum 2gb ram, there are hundreds of apps available to install. Android TV box is able to install all of them, unlike android TV. I use Tanix 3X Mini with 2GB RAM and it is able to run more than 70 apps. It comes with inbuilt kodi app and there are lots of apps on aptoide TV store, which provide contents for free.\nAnother advantage is VA panel, which provides a good contrast. Also I had seen OLED panels go haywire due to thermal runaway, thus needing whole panel to be replaced.\nNow about Flipkart. The earlier TV was damaged during transit. However, with timely follow up by Flipkart and Jeeves installation team, replacement was done quickly.\nTV was finally installed yesterday and I am happy with experience. Viewing angles are very good despite poor reviews about VA panels. Contrast is very good and viewing is pleasing to eyes.\nThis TV needs a good set top box as sd channels are not sharp.\nSound is loud and clear. I am unable to connect my home theatre as audio output socket is of S/PIDF type and headphone jack is missing.\nI will update review after few days.",
            "Good TV with nice display and excellent sound. People who is looking for a pure Android TV should not confuse with this TV. This TV is not a complete smart TV as it lack voice control remote also this is not a anroid TV. This TV is Linux based having few applications only. Will give detail review after few weeks",
            "After using and watching this tv for 5 days am posting this review .\nFor anyone who is looking to upsize for an 40 inch smart, LED tv , this is the best choice. Please do not compare with any other leaders in today\u2019s market.Basically it serves my purpose of having a smart LED TV\n\nPros\n1.Delivery was prompt by Flipkart, to add this the prompt service and installation was first feel good factor.\n2.Installation by Jeeves person was too useful and the service engineer too was very much helpful and coordinating.Keep up the good job Flipkart and Jeeves team\n3.When it comes to features it does fulfil all basic requirements. Picture quality is also good, sound is loud and clear although bass effect is missing but clearly not a worrying factor.\n4.Overall it\u2019s an Yes\n\nCons\n1.As such no negative points but worth to mention, 176 deg viewing angle doesn\u2019t give the same effect as watching it from front, you feel the difference in watching it beyond probably 135 deg sideways with change in sharpness and brightness but not to worry as we tend to watch sitting in front of the TV\n2. The extra HDMI ports and other extra ports are located beyond the TV making it uncomfortable to reach\n\n\ud83d\udc4dOverall This is one of the best at this price and hope to have sustainable features as it is for a long run",
            "crispy clear picture sound quality was super connecting internet is to easy ,early delivered the TV and same day installation done over all satisfied thank to flipkart",
            "I bought this tv because many of my friends recommended the brand and i was happy with 43inch marq android tv. I bought this expecting similar quality but the display on this is pathetic. The 4k upscaler which they mentioned is of no use. If i play 4k content it looks good/ok. If i play any content in even 1080p it looks very bad and skintones are very white and not at all natural. The HDR doesn't work at all. Imagine playing 720p content like your HD channels from dish tv, they look very very poor and you can't recognize faces. If it's not HD channel then its better you don't take a dish connection. Very poor display quality. Blacks are gray and not black. The contrast ratio is very very terrible. Trust me guys i can adjust for a average display quality but this is pathetic. It looks very gray and if you set dynamic contrast its uneven and changes abruptly. It makes faces very bad. Even with little increase in contrast makes it look bad. There's no way to return this and i regret that. If flipkart accepts it back and replace with a more costly better version, i m ready to pay for it and i will be happy to exchange this with an ips panel. This is pathetic don't buy this please.",

            "this is not a smart TV. it is a wanna be tv with a mask of a smart TV. this is good for people who want to save money and watch content exclusively with set top box which is an archaic and redundant way of watching stuff.\n\nCons:\n1) it's not an Android TV. so no apps are supported. Hence forget about Jioapp, hotstar, sonyliv, curiosity stream or any apps. you will get bunch of default apps and that's it.\n2) You open the browser and try to see the content on the website, good luck. the system memory is so low that the browser crashes. if it doesn't crash in sharp 5 minutes then it will freeze there for eternity.\n3) Screen mirroring is supported only on certain handsets. and this shouldn't come as surprise to Flipkart or service partner (Jeeves) . in fact it is their default answer. You might ask: \" hey if they know that all devices are not supported, then why are they not communicating it\". well you better ask them because customer experience is a thing of the past. all they need is your money. have tried Moto, Lenovo and Yu yureka. didn't work. worked on one of the 2 technician's phone. hurray!!\n\n4) Overall OS is lagging\n\n5) no return policy. only replacement is entertained. no upgrades either. so if you buy it you are stuck with it.\n\nPros:\n1) good image and lag free for set top box\n2) good sound quality\n\nConclusion:\nif you are lured by the price and the tag of smart TV, then pls don't buy this dumb tv. rather buy Marq normal tv if price is the criteria. And buy an HDMI or Chromecast in future.\n\nif you want a genuine smart TV which supports apps blindly buy MI Tv.\nand visit their experience center and buy it from there. they are honest and upfront about everything and not sneaky\n\nwon't recommend this or Flipkart to any genuine buyer.",

BAD- 1.you might not be very happy with it because of the fact that you can't pair samsung phone to the tv (if u use Samsung) 2.I would suggest you to get the Android version as it has good connectivity as well as good user experience. 3.

The sound is not bad because it has dolby sorround feature, but it is a bit bassy and not in a good way because its a bit hard to hear the treble (vocal) voices. Adding a speaker system will easily solve the problem.\n\nBut the display quality is just brilliant for the price. I strongly recommend using Netflix (FHD) to witness the full potential of the smart TV.\n\nSpecial mention : The UI is also very responsive and convenient. The same applies to the remote controller.\nThe UI and remote are much better than MI TV's (personal opinion only).",

            "Actually this was the first Time .. I refered to purchase A online based manufactured product ... And coming to the point flipkart was Gud brand for the products we use daily .. Like earphones Some Home appliances etc. and To see the view in A Tv range .. we may Go ahead for the top brands when we are plaaning to buy a tv .. But Marq changed all those .. Having so many features in this mid range Tv .. Nice connectivity and picture is Quite dull when we connect it to A local cable .. I think it'll also set when we have Perfect dth connection .. sound was quote awesome .. real Dolby was coming out of the speakers they gave .. And finally the product makes me happy .. . And am proudly saying u can buy it .. Withour thinking more ..",
            "Have been using this TV for almost 10 days, got a good deal for just 9200 including 3 years comprehensive protection, completely satisfied with the performance so far considering the the price I paid. The picture quality is pretty good, sound output is decent. Best feature is you can cast your mobile content on TV very easily",
            "Best smart TV at this price point.the picture clarity is so good that you can mark even a point.a lot of people complaint that after 5 or 8 audio level doesn't increase actually.i didn't faced such situation.it is actually increasing even after 20 also you can notice the level up or down.and you don't need a subwoofer or soundbar.the TV itself more than enough.and the sound quality is also just wow.plus it has a Dolby option which makes the listening experience more pleasantful.you can also edit the picture modes and lighting and colour options under personal modes and take the viewing experience as u desire.full HD videos runs flawlessly.one small cons I found so far is accessing the connectivity ports located at the back once the TV is wall mounted.but that doesn't seems to be a big issue i guess.most of the most used required ports are located at the side panel for easy accessing.if you observe very prominently you might feel a small lag/delay when you use this over wifi due to its lower RAM.but that is completely negligible.you won't even able to mark it in normal situation. overall it's a good buyout i must say.trust me guys you ll definitely enjoy this purchase for sure.",
            "This is an awesome smart LED TV, price is very competitive and provides additional 2 years warranty (1+2) by paying just nominal amount. I purchased it during offer and it is highly recommended to anyone looking for smart LED tv.",

            "Using this TV for more than three months, works perfectly fine. the sound system could be but better as I see sould when TV plays with Tata sky input and TV only sound mismatches a lot. connectivity could have been better as I always go to WiFi and manually connect all times. otherwise, TV plays fine with expected quality.",

Connectivity: 2/5: iPhone screen mirror not possible well that is understood. Most of Android Phones you cannot connect. But Wifi is good and auto connects also.\n4. Apps: 2/5 - YouTube crashes after 12 minutes and Netflix crashes after 6 minutes. So you need to delete all apps and pre-installed apps are useless apart from YouTube and Netflix. Netrange is too funny. There is nothing inside that. You also cannot install apps from Pendrive.\n5. Value for money: 4/5.. At 10K this is the best TV you can buy. So if you want to enjoy smart tv features then get a Amazon Firestick.\n\nDelivery and Installation: 5/5",

No issues up until now and awesome delivery time by Flipkart, got delivered the next day of order.\n\nI upgraded from a 49\" TV and this definitely seems bigger. The sound output from this TV was a pleasant surprise. I did not expect this TV to sound so good. The picture quality is also good enough and you can play around with all the different modes and contrast options to get the best video output for your environment.\n\nAlthough, there is a smoothness setting that can be adjusted within the settings as well, this does not work as I expected it too and if you set to the smooth option you can see quiet a lot of frame tearing. However, I shouldn't really expect the features or processing of a TV which is 3 times its price.\n\nOverall I am a happy customer, for now. Let's see how it holds over time.",

So, If I am ready to overlook my struggle to find the ideal picture settings without getting saturated washouts for fine gradient colours on rich pictures, the other things are nice about this TV. Sound is excellent; The built-in APPs work very well (including NetFlix at 4K). The WiFi and Ethernet is solid.

The sound is not up to the mark. The background noise is more than the dialogue while watching movies. I've tried adjusting the settings but there's no difference. Also while connecting my phone with the TV through casting there are lags in some intervals.\nRest the TV is good if you use it for normal viewing or playing files through USB. WiFi too works smooth.

            "Flipkart is selling 2 types of 55 inch 4K TV, one for 35k and the other for 39K. I wanted to buy the one with IPS panel which has Android 8 software. The features that you get for the extra 4-5k is worth it. Also I too the extended warranty for this model which was for Rs 2999. Mysteriously for the 55K IPS model the extended warranty is for Rs 999. Unfortunately I inadvertently ordered the inferior one and according to Flipkart the only provide a replacement, not return. The picture clarity is however very good, so is the sound. The apps are very limited (YouTube and Netflix are the only face savers). HD channels have great clarity however you will be unhappy with the ordinary ones. Since I happen to purchase during the Diwali period the product got delivered in a lethargic 2 weeks time. Also I had to place repeated complaints with Flipkart to get the installation done ASAP as it had crossed 3 days after delivery period. If you purely want to watch HD channels and no app gimmicks then you can quietly go ahead, I would however fully recommend for the IPS version. 3 stars dor picture, sound and connectivity.",

No issue with the remote, I have used multiple remotes but the issue persists (of course I disconnected the remote and then tried so don't tell me to take out battery as some button may have been pressed). There is no customer care or service center we can reach to. This TV was flawless until a week ago, 55 inch for such a low price is incredible, the quality is unbelievably good, sound is fab but all in vein as the volume issue seems to be a major drawback.. Checking on YouTube I see the issue can be fixed by opening the back panel, it Means I will have to reach out to a professional so it will cost me a fortune.. I had given 5 stars earlier will give it 3 after 14montns use..",
