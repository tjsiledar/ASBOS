            "Excellent Led Smart Tv this Range\nSound quality excellent\nNet connectivity excellent\nRemote looking also excellent\nGoogle assistant also excellent",
            "This TV is a great purchase with all the lastest features. With Android 10, the TV is super smooth and the boot time is very very less as compared to other TVs. And also it boots up extremely fast if it is in stand by mode. Picture quality is just awesome and it is able to play 4K videos from youtube and at the same time it supports dolby vision which makes the picture quality more awesome (the video which you are playing should be Dolby vision as well). I did not have any connectivity issues till now. It connects to wifi very quickly and casting is pretty smooth (you need to have a good internet connection which will give you the best experience as far as the connectivity is concerned). I tried playing videos using a pendrive and it could play videos from there as well. Bluetooth pairing is fast and it can work as a transmiter and as well as receiver. From play store u can download a lot of apps. I did not try playing games till now. Only app i could not find is JioTV. Sound quality is excellent and it can get very loud (25% is quite loud for me) and dont forget to switch on dolby atmos. The remote is bluetooth paired and it works from anywhere as long as it is connected. TV installation was done by jeeves and the service engineer was well educated about the TV and installation was done very quickly and perfectly. He aslo gave a demo about the TV features and showed every thing he could. Overall I am happy with the TV, flikart's delivery, packaging and installation. I hope the TV will keep working good and also hoping for motorola's support in case of any issues.",

Yes it supports 4k videos but like you can setting for dolby sounds but not for vision, it is just set upto vivid and shows that supports hdr 10... Sounds are good when it is kept under 50 increasing sound level will hurt quality of hearing...",

            "Used it for more than a month now. For seamless experience I wanted a TV with atleast 2 GB ram and 16 HD and I must say this tv's performance with 2 GB ram is far far better than all other TV's with 1gb of ram. Picture quality is absolutely stunning. Sound matches what they promise. This TV should be foremost priority for anyone planning to buy 32 inch tv. I have 32 inch realme and 43 inch VU tv installed at my home but this tv exceeds in all parameters when compared to them. I regret that I ...\nREAD MORE",

Overall TV is good ,Great product to take.",
            "Picture quality is not up to the mark. My old Samsung tv is giving better picture quality.\n\nUpdate: I have an issue with my Set-Top box. After getting a new set-top box now it is providing prominent picture quality. Still, I can say that Samsung has better picture quality if you want to choose cable TV.\n\nBut if you choose OTT services, this TV can show awesome quality \ud83d\udc4d\u2728, where Samsung lags a lot. For casting, if the default app is not installed, it is a bit laggy sometimes, where sony comes in place. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc4c\n\nOverall, I'm happy with the product.",

Picture quality descent(not expect somthing like premium bands but it is good)\n3. 5GHz wifi supported. Good connectivity\n4. Table stands are very good.\nCons:\n1. Build quality can be improved more.(not bad although)\nOverall good product. I am satisfied with it upto now.",
            "It's been a month of using this product and I'm pretty satisfied with the picture quality and really impressed with the sound quality and loudness it comes with. Being a non 4K TV it allows running 4K videos which various other TV of this range does not support and are restricted by the software itself. Connectivity is really good, it connects to the wifi and play highest quality videos without buffer at places where my mobile and laptop lack connectivity due to low range of wifi in that particular area, so the company must have implemented real strong wifi card inside. Overall, really satisfied with this purchase.",
            "Best in class product.\nWithin 1 day delivery, within 2 day's installation.\nBought at a lowest price of 16,000 rs.\n\nTotally satisfied with the overall experience, have recommended lot of my friends and they gave the same feedback.",
            "One of the best tv u can get in this price segment.good picture quality and sound quality also though the speakers are overrated but still the sound is clear but lacks bass.\nOverall picture quality is satisfactory but blacks are not tha good u can see some discrepancies on the screen when u watch a movie which has high blacks.\nConnectivity is good and the voice assistant works so well.",
            "Best buy , go for it . Dolby Sound system is excellent , display is supper , Technician is very supportive \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",
            "Picture and video quality of the tv is very nice but they need improvement in sound. It produces very less base effect. Using tv as a computer monitor, the picture and the text quality and clearity is not very good but it's ok it support 1920*1080 display resolution",

            "I have been enjoying the experience of this TV with android OS. The best part is the Dolby atmos sound. The sound is good enough for most viewing. I keep the volume at 10. More than that neighbors get disturbed. For better base and theater like experience will definitely need soundbar with woofer. The picture quality is very nice, even though it is not 4K. For our requirement 1080p was more than enough for now. The bluetooth remote and the bluetooth connectivity is wonderful. I have kept a dedicated headphones in the hall for watching at night without disturbing anyone around. Just pair the headphones once and you're good to go.\n\nI have experienced TV restart a couple of times. This could be with the voltage fluctuation. Also I have noticed the voice recognition not working in the remote once. I restarted and it started working. It did not repeat so i did not call support still.\n\nOverall i am happy with the product and i would definitely recommend buying this.",
            "Best Android 10 Smart TV at this price range. The TV offers the best picture view and sound quality with the support of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. Motorola is probably the most preferable TV brand after Sony and Samsung in India.",

            "Initial impressions with the TV after using it for 10 days. Picture quality and sound quality is very good. Worth the money for the specs this offers.\n\nFew issues observed.\nThis TV has support for 5ghz wifi but it was unable to connect automatically after restart of the TV. Works fine with the 2.4ghz wifi but issues is only with 5Ghz. Seems more of a software problem issue.\nInterface offered with the TV is not that intuitive as it is not easy to open apps which we use frequently.\nGoogle assistant works in opening the app but not the movie or videos inside the apps like hotstar or prime video.\n\nOverall issues seems to be with the software. Hopefully Motorola can fix and release an update.",

Doesn't even last for minutes and starts lagging and then stops working. Have tried with different phone same thing happened. Other thing is it shows model as flipkart tv makes you wonder if this is really motorola tv or what? Even after reset its model will always show as flipkart tv which even though should not matter but doesn't feel good to me.\n\nOver all its a good tv and if you you want to use it as a tv for HD content, this is a pretty good deal.",

It can play 4K videos in Netflix and YouTube which is added advantage in HD ready TV. The TV doesn't get heated up even if we watch all day. Casting takes place easily and even screen mirroring works. Google Voice search gives accurate results. Viewing angle is fine but can be better. Color saturation reduces a little from higher angle.",

I purchased this smartTV around Diwali and writing this review after almost 1 and half months of usage.\n\nMotorola ZX2 is a solid device overall. The overall performance is satisfactory and so is the picture quality. This is the best smartTV in this price range. The device comes with 40W AmphiSoundX Pro Audio and has Android 10 which is first in this class. This is world's 1st HD TV with Dolby Vision & Atmos which is another USP of this smartTV.

This is the only TV with 2GB and 16GB, even some of the bigger TVs doesnt have that feature. IPS panel was a must have at this price but unfortunately its a VA panel. unavailability of IPS panel takes away the clear viewing angle from sides (my Old VU TV had IPS and viewing from any angle was same experience, same color).

RAM 2 GB and ROM 16 GB\n\nCons:\n1. Fewer settings for Audio Output\n2. Dark spot seen at the right bottom of the screen\n\nOverall a Good TV at this price. Has good features compared to other brands. If you are on budget and don't care about BIG BRANDS then go for it.",
            "Purchased the tv nearly a month ago. It's a great tv.\n\nPros:\n1. Picture quality is amazing.\n\n2. Build quality is top notch .\n\n3. The remote is very responsive. It catches voice commands very easily.\n\n4. Sound is very loud and clear.\n\n5. Android 10 adds a feather to this masterpiece.\n\n6. Bluetooth connects very easily\n\nArea of improvement:\n\n1. I wish the sound were little bit more bassy. Being a bass lover I miss it. Considering its 40 W sound output, woofer like bass could have worked like wonders.\n\n2. It's a bit unresponsive although very rarely .\n\n3. Aspect ratio could have been worked upon .\n\n4. Power consumption is on the higher size. May be because of its 40 W sound output.\n\nOverall it's a decent purchase. I would recommend you all to go for it. Some pictures are attached to give you some ideas regarding the Tv set.\n\nThanks for reading my review.",

            "Review after initial usage.\n\nPanel Quality is very cheap. I mean like seriously cheap. Amusingly the model name of the TV is Flipkart TV everywhere and not ZX2, so it makes me think whether its just a rebrand of Marq TVs! Side by side compared it with MI 40 inch and Sony Bravia 32\".\n\nPicture and Sound Quality of 4 Years old Sony Bravia is way better than this. In terms of MI, picture quality of MI was found to be better with more accurate colours, whereas sound was bit better of Motorola.\n\nAlso, my sony has 30 watt speakers which is way louder and better than Motorola 40 watt speakers with Dolby Atmos. Almost double. So it is not actually 40 watt speakers but 20 actually at max.\n\nAnother problem I encountered was that with every Boot Up, the TV first enters into channel scan or whaterver source mode you have kept(say hdmi 1) default and you need to press home to go to smart tv android homepage. It wont directly boot up to android tv home page like every other android tv and there is no option to change. A big con for me who just wants to use smart tv features like Netflix and Prime videos etc. and doesn't need to use any type of input source. With every bit I have to hit an extra button to use my tv normally.\n\nPros : 1. Connectivity options\n2. Good Processor.\n3. Ram and storage\n4. Dolby Audio and Video\n5. Remote with some extra features\n6. 4K runs on YouTube, Prime Video and Netflix automatically.\n7. Latest Android\n8. Metal Stands\n\nCons : 1. Flipkart TV and not Motorola.\n2. No different than previous android version. Exactly same.\n3. Sound Quality not as good as advertised.\n4. Picture quality and colors not at all upto the expectations\n5. Cheap Panel Quality.\n6. Very short lenght of Power Cord.\n7. No external adapter present on the power adapter\n8. Google Assistant was having alot of troubles recognizing voices but not sure because I had plastic cover on the remote.\n9. No apps button on tv remote.\n10. Bulky remote. MI remote is by far the sleekest best remote.\n\n\nWill edit with every discovery.\n\nAlso, if flipkart rejects my review, I am suing them for fraud and hiding facts and misappropriation of reviews on a product page.\n\nEdit 1(29/11/20) - Software is extremely buggy and there is not a single software update or fix since launch. Also, motorola customer support is really worthless and unhelpful. They dont even know their own product. They just sold their brand name rights to flipkart. Flipkart is manufacturing, servicing, marketing and selling the TV. Motorola just gave its name. It seems a star will start to fall from my review with every passing month. Serious TBH. Best if you just want to enjoy normal live tv from your cable or dth operator. Bad for Android TV and OTT experience.",

Even though it is a 720p tv, FHD videos look just awesome\n*Great Sound\n*No bullshitry of bluetooth, wifi, hdmi, casting connection getting lost, or not working properly. Everything works just fine\n*Dual band wifi which is again future ready.\n\nCons-\nWarranty - Only 1 year warranty on tv. LG is giving 3 years. This makes me question the quality of panel. I just hope it works fine for years to come.\n\nSo all in all, it is the best tv. 1 GB, Android 9 tvs are now obsolete. Go for this, if you don't mind the warranty. This is the best tv and obviously other companies will now come out with variants that match Moto TV but for now this is THE BEST.",

But in certain cases AI in video processing makes some videos look artificially fair and we don't get the true image... Motorola should provide function to disable it's AI function.\n\nAudio is not okay.. Without Dolby Atmos switched on it is just pathetic. Even with the Dolby Atmos turned on it is lacking punch (Bass) and clarity... seems Motorola has not provided the hardware (woofer/sound system) to compliment the software. HDMI ARC supported in HDMI1 is a great feature and using a HDMI sound bar can improve the audio quality.\n\nNetwork support for both dual band wifi is a BONUS specially since the TV supports 4K content streaming.. Cannot ask more in this price bracket.\n\nAndroid OS performance is excellent , boot time is good no noticeable lags. Gaming .. no compatible joystick Found after trying a few.",

It's sound quality is incredible .40 Dolby surround + dtc gives us theater like experience with modes like sport,movie, music etc. The clarity of sound is very pleasant and hard to believe to get tv with Android 10 with YouTube, Zee Plex , bluetooth, wifi etc support can come at such low price.

The description says it has headphone jack whereas it doesn't have one.\n\n2. The description says it has Prime video pre-installed. Actually it is not. Also while searching Prime Video app in Play Store it doesn't show. So i had to sideload the app.\n\n3. In the description it is also mentioned thay 6 months Spotify Subscription is free but have not given the details to claim the same.\n\n4. The sound is really good but bass is missing. Those expecting high bass as per the description of speakers will be disappointed as i was.\n\n5. The Bluetooth sound quality is good but the volume level has to kept more than 50-60 % for loudness and kindly note that the TV doesn't support Dolby Atmos or Dts sound effects on Bluetooth audio.",

            "I am writing the review after using the TV for over a week.\n\nDolby Atmos: The sound quality is very good; one can distinctly hear all the beats. Further, one can choose a user mode, if interested, but I quite like the auto mode.\n\nDolby Vision: Given that it is an FHD and not a UHD, the picture quality is very good. One should not expect a UHD quality on this TV. Then the colours rendered are crisp. The black colour is pure black and the white colour is pure white without any blue tint which is very good. All other colours are distinct. I found that, in auto mode, the dimming or brightening was not as efficient as I expected but I used the user settings as per my choice and I am happy with the output.\n\nOperating System: The TV got about 1GB download at the time of installation to upgrade itself to the latest Android 10. Android 10 brings with itself a lot of benefits like dark mode, an efficient operating system, etc. Hope, Motorola provides continuous updates and upgrades.\n\nOne thing I liked was that the TV remembers the last few operations quite well, so when you press the back button, it will play the last item that was being played, so you don't have to go and search that channel again.\n\nRemote Control: Remote control could have been slicker. It has lots of buttons which are useless for the TV. If someone is using a dish TV, maybe it was more useful. I expected a smaller and simpler remote control with fewer buttons like most of the other brands are providing.\n\nThe icing on the cake is Flipkart's unmatched customer care.",

So totally I have now 3 years of warranty from JEEVES\n6) Installation was done within 3 hours of delivery and delivery person was so gentle and explained everything very well\n\nAlthough this looks kind of simple TV, they could have given different colour metal stand like nokia to give it an elegant look, also the sound bar is integrated, while the sound bar on Nokia TV looks better .... Another thing is that we would have to use 2 remote if we want to play normal TV since our DTH set top box can't pair android TV remote... So this remote control is just for TV features and DTH remote is for channel watching\n\nBut overall, no complaints at all ... This product might look normal from Outside but it's technically beast from Inside...\n\nI bought this product for 12750 during sale and I feel it's very very good buy for this product !",
            "Good experience with awesome picture and sound quality. Black background can be better. Noticed gap near bezels on top and bottom and LHS too",
            "This is amazing tv my whole family love it... and I'm a tech geek and also UI developer as a profession... when I first opened it and till now I love everything about this tv guys don't get fool by other brands this is what you should invest your money in im telling you no other brands can compete Moto Tv 2020",
            "Awesome",
            "Amazing experience..\nGot delivered & installed too within one day..\nSound quality,connectivity,picture quality is good..\nOverall its a very good product & worth."
