            "its a good tv in the price range. far ahead of existing MI,TCL and all other tvs of this price range. color is awesome, contrast level is also very good. it offers extra picture enhancements like live color, black correction etc. picture wise no complains. many ppl wrote its a VA panel has viewing issues but trust me its awesome to watch this tv.\nSound is awesome, my hall is 22*18ft and sound is nowhere less in any corner, dont expect it to be like hometheatre. i did not face any connectivity issue yet but yes, it takes almost 1 min to get all the connection ready which means if you just start and open youtube it will not connect after 30-40 sec it starts all connection.\nsome thing Nokia may improve :\n1. I personally dont like the surround sound feature as as soon you make it On the bass vanishes.\n2. frame rates could be better like if it gets an update like MEMC or motionflow technology of Sony it would be an awesome deal. currntly it is also good\n3. 5G wifi is not supported only 2.4G is supported\n\nGo for it if you dont want to spend 1.25 lakh for Sony\nCheers!",
            "During 2020 big billion days i bought it.After so many research ....( I was planning to buy a Sony TV... but we can blindly save a lot of money if you go for Nokia with same config.)\n\nGuys...I\u2019m sharing my feedback after 30 days of usage.\nTV clarity , design & sound everything is good ( you don\u2019t even need external speaker). Delivery was super fast .\n\nMy installation agent was very hurry & rushing.. which makes me uncomfortable. Except everything is good at this moment. Thank you Flipkart \u2764\ufe0f",
            "The TV is just awesome, don't believe in any roumors it works like a charm. Picture quality and sound are unmatched in this price range.\nThe issues which this TV had earlier\n1- Wifi issue : This is fixed via an update (though it was possible to do manually )\n2- Tv reboot : This only happens when u play Dolby vision HDR videos and that is due to slow internet speed, I have 20 mbps wifi plan and it only buffers in Dolby Vision HDR 4k videos but when i pause the stream for 15-20 seconds it works like a charm so a solution to this is to have good internet speed 40mbps recommended.\nI didn't find any issues with wall mount as well, the sound is simply breath taking i never increased the volume to more than 25% its that loud and crisp. Considering playing 4k videos it works beautifully on all ott platforms like Netflix, not having Dolby vison and dual band wifi doesn't make any difference as the picture quality is excellent even without Dolby Vision for a normal user you simply cannot find any difference in Dolby vision 4k HDR video and a normal 4k HDR video and single band wifi works like a champ no issues faced as of now (except Dolby Vison enabled 4k HDR videos on youtube), rest all 4k HDR videos stream without any issue even with 20mbps speed (on youtube and all ott platforms).\nComing to setup box i have Tata sky setup box and believe me even sd channels look brilliant (recommend viewing distance more than 5 feet), Haven't tried hd channels on tata sky yet.\n\nMy conclusion is just go for it without any second thought, 50\" variant is much better than 43\" in both picture and sound.",
            "After Lot of Search i Choose this Tv and it's Very Good Decision for me and My Family.\nEvery one is Happy with Tv.\nSound is very Good\nPicture quality is awesome\nConnectivity is superb over mobile Data and WiFi also\n\nBut Only one things is not good it's Installation the person is came and he was in hurry so he didn't give proper time for demo.\nEven i feel tv is not Proper install on wall mount.\n\nOther wise almost 5 out of 5",
            "I start with cons as pros are everywhere.\nCons:\n1. Panel don't have good viewing angles especially in bright daylight conditions, u can see lots of reflection if you are sitting slightly on left or right.\n2. Don't support 5Ghz wifi, so my wifi do have 5GHz with 100 Mbs but this TV connects to 2.4GHz having 40Mbs speed, you can still watch 4K content, but I noticed it's not super smooth, also live HD channels viewing experience is not that great.\n3. Sound quality no doubt is good, but sometimes you feel there's a need for external sound bar n sub woofer.\n\nThat's all, I have given it 4 star just because of its value for money, I can't find a TV under 40K giving this much features.\nIf nokia can improve on first 2 points, there's nothing much left to argue to be honest.\n\nSo whom I should recommend:\nIf you have a closed room, with minimum sunlight, this panel display works for you. I have added pictures, refer them.\nAlso if you have wifi speed of > 40 mbs at 2.4GHz, this TV displays smoothly.\n\nHope this helps, I have added pics with 4K video running at 90 degree n around 140 degree, check them out.",

Excellent display of 4k content with great contrast and quality\n\nAlthough slightly pricey when compared with other QLED counterparts like TCL, 1+ but can be justifiable for the amazing sound system offered (especially for 65\" - 48W output is awesome)",

Issue resolved.\n\nOverall fantastic smart 4k LED TV, very much comparable with big brands.",
            "After 20days suddenly the screen is not turning on . Power led is on, but when i try to on the tv it's get a blink in the screen and turning off again. I raised a complaint with flipkart.have to see what they going to do.I bought on the first sale day. The delivery was very quick ( one day delivery mine not being a metropolitan city) . Installation was also quick the very next day. I am satisfied with the picture quality and sound. Great value for money. Should look into durability and performance as the time pass. I see the tv is hanging some times and i have turn it off and again turn on the tv . I don't know whether it can be rectified by software updates. Any one facing the issue ?. The tv is a bit slow. It is hanging at moments.",
            "I bought this TV after a lot of comparison for almost 3 months. Finally manage to buy this one. Using it for the last 10 days and it's a super tv. No negative points so far.

            "I was waiting for a tv for so long that was the same price as the chinese tv like mi and realme but wasn't chinese. This is a perfect budget tv, good picture quality, sound output is also good. This is the best budget tv, get's the job done nicely",
            "I have used for one & half months The Nokia TV absolutely do not have any problem it is one of the best buy. However, the remote consumes more energy as I have compelled to replace new battery cells with in a month and a half. The supplier is very good in keeping up the time of delivery, and responsive to the complaints I thank him for immediate reply and service. I recommend this product based on my usage and observation. Thanks for the supply of good product Flipkart.",
            "Delivery and Installation done earlier than the assured date. Thanks to flipkart delivery and installation team for the safe delivery .\nThe TV looks very beautiful and premium.\nDisplay is good and 4k contents looks very realistic , HD contents are good and SD contents are poor but its as expected .\nSound is fantastic , feels like we are inside the movie hall. No need for extra sound bar.However with software update the sound level has reduced. Hopefully the next update will take care of this issue.\nThe smart features like , night mode,music mode,sleep timer are really handy. Music mode is really handy i.e tv can be used as BT speaker with tv dispaly off and it saved my extra money on sound bar buy.\nPorts on the back side is bit difficult to reach when wall mounted , however its negligible issue.\nBluetooth , wifi , google voice command works without any issue.\nRemote controller is very minimalist and its manageable.\n\nSuggestion : If you are looking for the big screen with budget buy go for it .\ni have bought the extended warranty just in case if any issue arises and to be on safer side.\n\nThis is too early review, will update the review after couple of months !!!\nThanks for reading my feedback , stay home stay safe .",
            "This is an amazing TV worth every penny... Fast wireless connectivity , good sound quality & amazing 4K experience \u2764",
            "Don\u2019t waste your time reading other reviews. Nokia is still the Best. Perfect TV for Home with perfect picture quality. Onkyo sound is good too. Worth buying in 2021.forget sony lg tvs even mi and other brands.",
            "Writing this after more than one month of extensive use. Got it with a deal at cheaper price. I would say it is the Best TV in the segment. Picture perfect, sound excellent, connectivity no issues. Nokia has done a great job with this TV. I would recommend this to all.",
            "Was very skeptical of buying Nokia tv when have lived in the world of Sony or Samsung. But after watching lot of reviews on YouTube and reading reviews online went for it.\nPicture Quality: Very Good. Netflix or any other UHD content looks great.\nSound: The best sound you can get on a Tv! It\u2019s just too good. Ample bass and loudness, for a small room you won\u2019t need anything else to enhance sound.\nConnectivity: I have not taken DTH connection and everything is working like a charm on wifi\nTotally Recommended",
            "Superb quality and good amzing sound at this price. I loved so much this tv. Thank u flipkart for ur valuable service",
            "I was searching for a TV from so many days. Finally I got this. Actually this is the gift for my Dad and he is happy with it. Everything is great and on top of everything, it comes with integrated sound bar from ONKYO which makes the experience even more enjoyable.\nAt this price point (40K) , you are getting a 55 inches LED 4K UHD SMART TV with integrated sound bar and all features, what more do you expect?\nGreat job Nokia. \ud83d\udc4d",
            "I have been using this TV from around 6 months and during this period, I have tested all the possible combination of system configurations/settings.\nI will explain few of the points briefly:\n\n1. Picture(5/5) - The greatest feature to buy this TV is its picture quality. However, it doesn't have good picture quality by default but after modifying few picture settings, picture quality is really amazing. Its picture quality can be compared with higher price brand TVs. Although it is not an OLED tv but still it provides deep black level in picture. Upscaling is so good that 1080p sometimes feel as of 4K video quality and 720p also looks good.\n\n2. Sound(2/5): Sound quality is off course better compared to TVs without attached soundbar. But it could have been much better as per attached soundbar in it. I have found 3 issues in sound of this TV:\na) No medium level of volume while increasing volume, i.e., either volume will be too low or too loud. After 3-4 points of volume level, it suddenly get too loud on increasing just one level of volume. And I have not got any permanent solution of this issue yet.\nb) Base in sound can be heard only when surround sound is off. When you change surround setting to on, then no base in sound.\nc) While using surround sound, right side speaker volume gets too low compared to left side due to which sound can not be heard from right side speaker in low volume.\nd) Surround sound quality is not as per expectation with attached soundbar as one of the SIMILAR PRICE TV WITH ATTACHED SOUNDBAR(cannot mention name to advertise that tv) provides much better sound(good surround sound quality with base) than NOKIA TV.\n\n3. Connectivity(4/5): With 2.4 GHz, I haven't face any issue in connectivity yet with Jio Fiber. However, 5 GHz should have been provided for long term use.\n\n4. Software(1/5): Software is disgusting. I have observed some issues in software:\na) TV restart suddenly and this issue is increasing day-by-day.\nb) No software update since I purchased this TV. Other TVs are providing software updates regularly even for android 10 but Nokia tv is not providing any update just for fixing sound and software issues. Seems we can' expect issue fixes and android 10 update in Nokia TV.\nc) Sometimes, I notice lag in switching apps.\n\n5. Storage and RAM(2/5): Storage space and RAM of TV is not sufficient for a Android Smart TV. I cannot think of installing games in this TV due to less storage space which is about to be completely occupied with other apps only.\n\nConclusion:\nIf you want TV with amazing picture quality in this price level and you don't have problem for not getting software updates, then only go for this TV otherwise go for similar price TV with attached soundbar for better sound quality and playing games.",
            "I am writing I am writing the review after using the TV for a week. frankly speaking the Connectivity is poor.\nYet i am giving 5 stars as i have seen sony, mi and moto tv having connectivity problem. The picture quality is adorable and the 30watt sound by onkyo givs you a chilling experience.. The remote design could have been better but its decent enough. Overall i am happy with the TV experience and would recommend to people reading the review.",
            "Excellent Picture and sound quality.\nI am in love with this TV. build quality is great...\nBetter than Chinese TV.... Very fast response and easy to connect..",
            "The only reason I preferred this tv instead of MI 55 inch, is because of the sound 48w onkyo.\nAt first when the installation happened and switched on the tv, there are clear black patches around the edges of the tv which looked very dull at edges. Since i had an LG 55 inch before the picture clarity all around the tv was very impressive, so Nokia 55 inch tv you\u2019ll not get that flawless or impressive pic quality feel. I have a 43 inch mi tv which I bought 3 months ago looks more vibrant in viewing and faster response.\nSo if given a choice, I would go buy MI tv instead of Nokia 55 inch. The only thing I\u2019m happy about this tv with is the sound 48W.\nIt\u2019s been a few months since I\u2019ve bought it, & I would say don\u2019t buy this brand. Issues with software and issues with clarity.",
            "Best buy, superb product!!!\nI was upgraded TV from samsung 39\" to Nokia 50\" UHD LED TV, after so many search on google n youtube even on many shopping centers like reliance digital, croma etc i did not found any perfect tv with all features and reasonable price as well. But finally i got my perfect tv with all required features in 4K led tv budget range The NOKIA 50\" UHD LED TV with superb price and discount at Flipcart. Its delivered in just one day and installation also done on next day with demo.\nAfter using since last 2 days i am happy with its superb picture quality, superb dolby digital sound by onkyo, smooth functioning n no lags with android processor till time even no issue found with single band wifi at all.\nI am happy with my decision and this product, Go for it with out any hisitation instead of paying 80/90K with other branded TVs.\nI like it , All the best \ud83d\udc4d",

            "Nokia TV is excellent comparing to other big brands ,\n\nPros:-\nPicture quality is very good\nSound quality is very good , even in low sound you can feel the sound qulity\nAndroid OS is amazing with lot of entertainment apps comparing to other big brands\n\nCons:-\nTV Remote is bit hard one [ comparing to other remotes like firetv box remotes ]\nSometimes experiencing the connectivity issue initially , but it goes of immediately by reconnecting to wifi again\n\nNotes to New Buyers :-\nRemote is combination of the IR + Bluetooth , by default your remote will be working , still you need to connect to Bluetooth of the tv to have a better performance and voice ssistant mode enabled\n\nOverall its an excellent purchase",
            "Pro:\n1. Sound works pretty well.\n2. In this budget picture quality is satisfactory.\n3 Delivery on time.\n\nCons:\n1. Remote quality is very cheap. After using of two months it stops working.\n2. Bluetooth connectivity is very poor.\n3. I got the product replaced but on second peace also found the same issue. In previous product there were dots on the screen.\n4: Google assistance hardly works.\n5. Remote connectivity on Bluetooth is also not good.\n\nOverall a so so product. You should go for it only if your budget is really tight.",
            "The TV is good value for money and good picture quality and sound. However after the android software update my dth dish tv sound stopped working with the TV on hdmi although sound is working with all other TVs so for sure due to the software update the incompatibility issue came up leaving me with no choice but to upgrade my set top box as well.\n\nOverall a good product with good picture and sound.\n\nUpdate : Got the Dth sound working. Go to settings then external HDMI inputs and change to 2.0 from the selected 1.4. This will make the sound work and improve the HD picture quality.",
            "For my experience this tv will satisfy all your needs.. picture quality and sound is excellent in LED segment.. Don't compare with samsung/LG since it's far beyond its reach. Money I paid for tv is valuable.. if you are having good budget then go for qled tv.",
            "Picture quality is good enough and satisfying\nSound quality is also good, very clear and loud enough. Don't expect rich bass from sound.\n\nWhen I switch on the TV, I need to wait for a min so for the time to update to correct current time, and then only internet starts working.\n\nVery small bleeding issue which can be observed when you start YouTube. On a grey background its clearly visible.\n\nI got at 38,999. I guess it was a good deal.",
            "All Apps working after a bit of work around.\n(Reset to factory default and update all apps in play store and then login). Also there is an online update which some users have reported that the problem got resolved after the update.\nSpeakers are excellent. Need some break in time.\nBluetooth songs play well from phone and you will not need additional Bluetooth speakers unless you want thumping bass.\nBuild is also good with solid stand.\nConnectivity is good (Keep Ethernet toggle on although you will not connect internet through Ethernet).\nPicture quality although a VA Panel has very good viewing angles. Deep black and colour reproduction is excellent.\nYou will not go wrong for the price.",
            "Guys, music/sound quality is superb and crispy , and quite loud .. you actually don't need to get a home theatre in your room untill and unless you require super bass..\n\nCost wise quite effective... .\nOnly I cannot find how to connect blue tooth (as it's my first smart tv and just only two days of owning a smart tv, hence I have to learn ,how to operate it ).\n\nWhen you are thinking about smart tv .. always go for NOKIA , with your closed eyes.",
            "3 months of usage..\nGood Aesthetic and nice finish. Wall mount also provided in the kit.\nSound: It is the top feature in this TV. Different options provided based on TV MOUNTING.\nPicture: 4K... We can feel the difference when we see 4k videos...\n\n\nThere is a lag/delay in getting exit from an app.\n\nInitially prime app didn't get logged easily, we need to update the TV for prime login. Hope it got resolved in new batch.\n\nI have completely satisfied with this TV so far.",
            "I got damaged panel with back light issue. Also the display light was getting off automatically. After replacing the TV I have received new TV. This time everything is working fine. Picture quality, sound, connectivity, outer look very good at this price. I am not satisfied with the moving videos like live sports. Otherwise it is a good TV in this price.",
            "I'm switching from my normal Samsung LED to this and Picture/Sound Quality is Awesome. After comparing with Realme new Tech SLED and I found NOKIA is better in terms of sound/picture quality(what else you will expect from a TV) 4K video's in YouTube plays without any issue. We can verify when we have 4K channels available. Dual band Wi-Fi is missing. But connecting the Direct Connect cable should solve the problem, no lagging.AIDA64 shows 160dpi.But not sure if that's true.SD channels are not that great. HD channels working OK and you have to spend more money for the channels though. Google assistant works fine. They should have added YouTube/Prime buttons in the remote. Fast and smooth navigation is really good. Bluetooth headphones connects without any issue. But you have to come out to the settings to pair for the first time. No idea about NOKIA/flipkart Aftersales service. I will post another review after rigorous tests.\n\nUpdate 0n 8th Nov\nNo parental controls disappointing!!\nGoogle assistant stopped working gives error as not ready",
            "I am happy that I bought this nokia 50 inch TV. I had placed order for mi tv and then cancelled the order for mi and took this TV. Picture clarity is superb. Sound is very clear, crisp and audible. The most important fact is the price. There is almost no difference between the price of mi and nokia but nokia tv is a far better product.",
            "Just loved it... Nokia has a brand image as a cellphone company. It has done really good in its television section as well. Sound & picture quality is just mesmerizing.. but needs to work on their connectivity issues.",
            "Audio and video of the TV was super... The Android system was lagging I was satisfied by the TV as I am DTH user presently.... Build quality of the TV was very very good.... Compact please give regular updates of software and connectivity improvement I would recommend 5 star..Mind blowing picture quality hope update for smart player for smooth fast forward in playing movies. Thanks to both Flipkart and Nokia",
            "VERY GOOD-LOOKING TV\nPOSITIVES\n- GOOD LOOKS\n- GOOD SCREEN QUALITY\n- GOOD SOUND\nNEGATIVES\n- SURPRISINGLY TAKES AGES TO START/LOAD THE COMPLETE SMART TV OPTIONS\n- CONNECTIVITY SOMETIMES IS NOT THAT GREAT\n- AIRPLAY DOESN'T DO HORIZONTAL VIDEOS FROM MY IPHONE/ PAD ONLY VERTICAL .. WHICH IS REALLY BAD",
            "Best decision ever, writing this review after 4 to 5 months of usage. For human eyes you won't notice this tv doesn't have Dolby vision, it's so good. . Even though single band wifi, it doesn't disappoint. If u have good Internet then it would play even 4k without any lag. After last updates sound issue is solved even at minimum points 5 or 6 fills the room .sound is loud and with good clarity. Only point in surround sound option bass reduces but stil it's good. For a normal person who just enjoy only songs videos wil be happy. There is no issue with casting and connectivity. Not sure of gaming as I don't use tv for this. Instead of zee5 hotkey , could have been for prime or YouTube.but it doesn't matter.",
            "I never thought that a smart TV could be so great like this, using Nokia 50 inch Ultra HD Smart TV for one year, I am now so much fascinated that no more TV can be called stupid box, its really taken all what needed. The biggest benefit of this Nokia TV that it is a big screen and also a clear skin, no issue to play 4K clearly and vividly, sound quality is just awesome and beyond of all I ever experienced early before of this. I can say Nokia has returned market back with this TV after loosing market in Mobile it is may be a turning back..",
            "Better than my previous purchase,i.e., Nokia 55\" Ultra HD(4K) with sound byJBL.\nThere is no need for any additional sound bar or system as it's more than sufficient for my 22/12 living room and believe me it's remarkable.Picture quality is also very good for the money,I have spent.Right now,I am fully satisfied, have to see how it performs in future.",
            "A good product at a REASONABLE good price. I effectively got it for 51300 in the sale and considering the onkyo soundbar it comes with it's a good deal. I will rate the overall experience as 3 as there should be the following minimum requirements\n\nHLG SUPPORT\nDOLBY ATMOS\nDOLBY VISION\nMEMC\nDUAL BAND WIFI. I had to get a lan ethernet cabling done than also max speed supported is 95mbps on 200 mbps connection.\nMIN. 32 GB INBUILT STORAGE as It doesn't support expansion of internal memory via us...\nREAD MORE",
            "A very good tv with great finish and built quality. The thin vessels give a great feel to the overall package.\nThe ports are ergonomically placed on the right side corner making it easier to change wires.\nThe display quality is very good... And the sound is awesome. Could be a little louder but does the work with great acoustics and a decent bass and treble.\nOverall it's a good package.... Go for this as compared to other Chinese brands. No connectivity issues whatsoever. Wifi single band runs 4k videos without any lag.",
            "Absolute value for money, excellent product, classy design , nice premium look and finish , easy and fully featured small remote, worth it , 5 star rating on all fronts , display, sound , connectivity, resolution, all in all fully justified, picture quality is very close to Oled resolution. Congrats to Nokia brand for an awsome product.",
            "It is good to consider for 50k price and I am satisfied if this works for long time without any issues.",
            "Updating my review after getting support from the tech support team - after the software upgrade the sound improved significantly. Bluetooth now connects and no voice break issues, however Bluetooth sound quality isn't great for movie watching, I can't explain but the voice quality looks like its dubbed.... but for normal videos, news, documentaries etc, it's fine.\n\nLetting my earlier review below as is, as people facing similar issue may find it useful. Thanks\n-------- old review below \u2014\u2014\u2014\nPicture quality is decent considering its price, however sound is not as great as the company claims about it's Onkyo speaker.\n\n1. Sound gets too loud even at 10-15% level and it goes from very low to very loud with just one level up. So too loud for night viewing. If u go low one level u won't hear the sound and one level above it will be too loud.\n\n2. Bluetooth headphones don't work properly with this tv. I have 3 Bluetooth headphones all work absolutely fine with my laptop, phone, pc and tablet but all 3 have major voice quality issues and connection keeps breaking. Basically you won't be able to use Bluetooth headphones at all. Calledi? customer service and they said its a known issue and they can't do anything about it.\n\nTo summerize, picture quality is decent and sound quality is also Ok not great but other sound/bluetooth related issues make the experience bad.",
            "This would definitely be one of the best purchase I've ever made.\nThe sound quality is simply too good. You can't get this sound even with a qled 1lacs worth of TV. The Onkyo Sound bar is too loud and clear and a great bass thump.\nThe tv has a music mode where the display switches off and just the music plays can be done even with youtube.\n\nThe best part is you can just connect it with your phone's bluetooth and play music even while keeping the screen off.\n\nOnly con I could find was \"missing the 5ghz wifi support\"",
            "Nokia led tv unveils its productive led tv with prestigious onkyo sound system which provides glarious sound. Nokia unveils its bar at led tv with stylish panel and high resolution picture. I can't even ask for more. Truly u won't regrets by its spec's.at market best price tag. Premium tv & it's accessories at an unmatched service support will add-on true add-on. Tag to it for smart purchase",
            "Flipkart's delivery was fast, and the installation was done in 2 days.The TV is great. The speaker of the TV is very powerful. No external speakers are required for this. The bass is cool. Looking at the price of full mark TV for audio quality. External device also support.\nTV picture quality is not bad but good/average. SD channel appears correct. But better if you take HD channels. screen cast work best befor update, but after the update,cast only work in default app that is fast cast , But YouTube, prime video, Spotify, Netflix, hotstar etc. It works very well in the cast.*If you are watching TV in a mid range for a big hall, then this TV is the best.* Compromise in a few pictures quality.",
            "Overall in this price range this tv seems to be a fair purchase.\n\nPositives:\n1. Usually people complain in budget tv's about brightness. I feel this one has enough to provide quality video output with good brightness.\n2. Onkyo sound bar on this tv is a very good addition. It provides better sound than any other in this price range.\n3. Looks premium\n\n\nNegatives:\n1.approximately 1% of times android user interface wither restarts or does not respond to remote control.\n2. Remote quality in not that great.\n3. Operating system is a little slow. Still usable without getting irritated.",
            "This is a very good product from Nokia and Flipcart, picture quality is great, the android features are working fine and build quality is very good. Streaming is good no buffering problem in any of the OTT platform and YouTube. Onkyo Sound bar is good as well. This is real value for money products and I would recommend this for any one considering a android TV with good picture quality and sound",

            "Bought after a lot of confusion between moto and nokia. The picture quality seems excellent also surprisingly the system works without any lag. The only dissapointment was the sound ( I may have more expectation than Onkyo) But it dosen't mean its bad. Overall the product looks and feels solid and worth the money. You can go for it. Will update after using it more rigorously. ( Installation service was average)\nHope this helps.!",

            "4 months now, picture is stopping suddenly after re start also working for 2 min then again same issue.\n\nProduct is awesome, Picture quality, sound, look and feel of the product is awesome. I strongly recommend this product. I purchased 3 years extended warranty as well for safe side.\nPicture quality is good compared to 1 year old 43' Sony TV. outfit is good compare to all the other models currently available in market (around 65k in 55 inch). Google assistance is more sensible compare to my Samsung 80cm (32 inch) HD Ready LED which i purchased 2 months back.",
            "Good choice in this price range. Smart TV life span is about 2-4 years. Then sure it will about to maintenance even if it is sony, now a days. So, within this elapsed price range features, spec and the quality of the panel is good and found okay. Can go for it.",
            "Best tv in the segment. Value for money as you'll get it around 55k during sale. The picture quality is great and sound quality is awesome. This tv is targeted towards the people who'll be using it for watching day to day series or movies i.e. may not be upto the mark for people who are into content creation. For me it's best purchase ever",
            "Pros:\nInbuilt onkyo sound bar is simply awesome. (4.5/5)\n\nPicture/display is okay ( 3.5/5) - deep blacks, good brightness. Satisfactory!\n\nBooting time is okay and no complaints about it.\n\nFlipkart installation was good and done in next day after delivery.\n\nNo lagging and performance wise is good.\n\nValue for the money!\n\nCons:\nAs Nokia is new entrant to TV, you can see Software bugs here and there. Most Annoying is channel scan screen that comes during on.\n\nHope in upcoming software releases, Nokia could fix it.\n\nApart from that, accessibility wise Connectivity ports are very difficult to access after wall mounting.\n\nRemote:\nRemote - hot keys for prime and zee5 (seriously ?????!). everything is fine ,except the Power off button in remote only makes TV to standby and need long press to power off.",

Worth buying in this price range.",

            "There were some hiccups initially, but the update fixed most of the issues. Installation was done within an hour of the delivery. There was thorough checks by the delivery personnel and Jeeves mechanic.\nFinal conclusion is, this TV is value for the money.\nPicture quality is the best in the class, and sound is loud enough that you won't need any sound bar.\nSoftware experience and Wi-Fi connectivity is okay-ish (just hope it get improved over the software updates).",
            "Product Build quality : Excellent\nPicture Quality: Excellent ( for the price)\nSound: Can't ask for better at this price, It's really good.\nInterface: Pretty good, Smooth, Have few glitches got okay after update.\nRemote control: Very good\nConnectivity: Everything is good be it wifi, bluetooth or connection to mobile or laptop.\n\nOverall tv is awesome at the price range.\nShould totally go for it.\nNokia delivers good quality standards again.",

            "The name Nokia brought in old memories of their phone which I had used for long time. This however was the reason for me choosing the 65 inch Android TV.\nThe sound system is the strong point, it is distinctly clear. Rightly it was highlighted in the specification and even the label on the TV tells how important it is.\nThe price at which it was offered made it look like a loot. The TV is a right choice for those who are looking for a compact and affordable yet performing android TV",
            "I purchased it after weeks of research, here are my initial Impression -\n1. Excellent software, no lag.\n2. Good picture quality.\n3. Delivered and installed on same day.\n4. Sound is good and loud. But I assume JBL (in 2019 model) is better.\n5. Premium look.\n6. Ports are on one side only.\n7. Super fast casting.\n\nCons:\n1. Nokia or Dixon handed over installation to one company who feels that they are the king in market. I don't like the professionalism of Jeeves team. Suggestion - please stand next to that full time when he install TV.\n\n2. 5Ghz band would be better but I purchased a 600 Rs. Lan cable with it and solved the problem.\n\nFinal verdict - A TV is primarily for viewing, don't go into the trap of Android10, memory size etc etc. This is good value for Money. If not this one, I recommend TCL or LG / Samsung",

The first time the WIFI didn't work and the second time they delivered a damaged TV where there was a dent in the screen. Finally, after 1 month I got the TV today(third one) and again there is damage in the screen. It was a small scratch and if I am going to ask for a replacement god knows when I am going to receive it again. Fed up with Flipkart and have decided to live with it. I told the technician the same. I won't recommend buying this TV and if you do, please check the screen carefully for dents and scratches. Ensure all the functionality works before the technician leaves your home. Getting a defective product once is something that can happen to anyone. Getting it three times in a row? Something is really wrong here.",

            "After a month long research of 55 inch TVs where I evaluated the Motorola ZX pro, Hi sense, Toshiba, Blaupunkt etc I bought this during the July 21 sale. So it's been about two weeks of using the TV. Delivery was next day and install the day after. Having used an LEtv 55 and a Samsung FHD 55 before, I had some reference points to check this against in addition to my research. While it's a bit too early to comment, TV checks out fine as of now. WiFi connection is flawless. Not sure why people want 5Ghz when 2.4Ghz does the job perfectly. 4K video streams instantly and I have not noticed any buffering whatsoever. Android TV works flawlessly too and I have noticed no lag at all. As for the sound, the Onkyo speakers are superb.None of my other more established brand TVs have a sound this good. Colour reproduction is excellent and pictures pop out. There is a sheen/ sharpness in the pictures. I tried all HDMI ports and the USB ports and all works fine so far. I was able to connect a camera to the USB port and the downloaded Google Duo detected it perfectly. As for issues, there was a problem of the TV restarting by itself ( on rare occasions) which resolved upon resetting the TV. I would say for around 37K, it seems a good deal. I have taken extended warranty from Flipkart not knowing long term reliability. While the picture and sound are great, what I like more about the TV is the look of it when switched off. It is aesthetically pleasing with the fabric covered Onkyo sound bar at the bottom and almost bezel less screen it enhances the decor..It is quite thin too. Also, the viewing angles are great and the screen doesn't reflect light abnormally. Need to now see long term reliability. I would strongly recommend this TV..",

What I felt from my side is that we should also have the option to activate both front speaker as well as the surround speakers at once so we can get a sustainable bass\n\nCasting is fine in most aspects except only when we want to directly from chrome sometimes it will not connect elsewhere it is completely good\n\nAnyone having a SD set top box while installing the tv I request them to change the box as well since it will affect your TV Experience as well if you don't have one , because the tv video stream will either stretched or compressed up..... So if you can please switch out.\n\nAll the connectivity ports works fine and wifi and Bluetooth are fast.\n\n\nGoogle assistant can recognise the voice well and is results are accurate and fast as well\n\n\nThat's it from my side....",

Only way is to launch fast cast on the then u can cast the device but once it is started to cast its soo good the image and sound are so awesome the only concern is about the chrome cast to cast your phone or any device we have to open an app then it will show up.

Even 1080p content appears filmsy on large screen as though you are watching a 720p content.\nHarsh in terms of brightness and colors\nNo 5 Ghz wifi, only 2.4Ghz band supported\nOnly 3 HDMI ports\nOnly USB 2.0 ports, No 3.0\nThe metal legs are eyesore, these spoil the premium look of panel.\n\nIf allowed i will revisit my review after a month. Overall I feel this TV requires plenty of software improvements. Tried with HD Set top box, 4K Streaming device, Direct USB, same results. Even my 4 year old VU 4K tv was better at upscaling content.\nI really hope there will be a software update to fix this and upscaling would improve.",

            "Awesome TV with balanced specifications. It was one of the best decision to buy this TV. Here are first impressions after first day usage.\n\nPros:\n1. Great panel picture quality\n2. ONKYO 5.1 sound bar quality is loud, punchier for such price band\n3. No lag so ever observed till usage\n4. Remote is compact and sufficient for use.\n5.\n\nCons:\n1. Not able to sign in with Prime Video app. After checking with Prime Video team Nokia TVs are not yet supported when registering in app.\n2. Not able to sign in to Ganna app\n3. Ports could be given with some extension since after wall mount there is no enough space for access.\n\nAdditional observations:\n1. True image quality can be only justified if higher internet bandwidth and 4k+ higher resolution available.\n2. Panel quality is so good that standard DTH connection resolution looks poor",

Black levels are impressive.\n-Viewing angle is acceptable.\n-Sound quality is awesome.\n-Connectivity with single band wifi is good and was able to stream 4k videos seamlessly without any frame drops - checked using YouTube.\n-Remote is minimalist and does its job.\n-Google assistant works perfectly fine.\n-Casting worked fine with Samsung phone. Had some issues while using a Redmi phone when trying to cast other than YouTube.\n\nIssues faced and fixed:\n-Volume adjustment was not proper initially. Was too loud when you just increase one point. This got fixed after the two pending software updates were installed.\n-Prime video was not signing in - This got fixed after doing a reset of the tv and updating prime to the latest version.\n\nWill update review based on further usage.",
