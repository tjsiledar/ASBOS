            "First of all I would say this TV is a bang for the money. I thought a lot before getting this TV but I finally took a bold step. First impression was amazing. It's far from perfect but good enough to let other smart TV's look worthless. YouTube works perfect, apps like showbox, google chrome, yupp tv, hotstar everything works seemlessly. Build quality is average, mouse pointer needs improvement, sound quality is good, picture quality is very good. Having said that, this TV needs a lot of improvements, haven't encountered any bugs till now but there is a slight lag on heavy usage. Screen mirroring is is very laggy, I found a lag of upto 3seconds which is too much. But when YouTube and other apps work seemlessly, I don't really need to use screen mirroring. Cloud TV remote app (Android) is good, does lot more than what you'd expect. If you are looking for a smart TV in budget, this thing will not let you down. Definitely a thumbs-up from my side.",
            "Awesome tv, its value for money, great picture quality, great smart features, smart remote with air mouse is very useful, I would have happily given 5 star to this product but reduced rating because some times remote stop working and have to restart the tv to get its working gain don't know whether its software problem or remote prob or prob with tv sensor.",
            "Date: 03/09/2017\nDon't buy this TV from Flipkart. Haven't used the product (CloudWalker 43inch Full HD Smart TV) and can't comment on the performance and quality. Basic parts were missing and the installation could not happen as expected. That shows the Quality of the company and the product.\n\nThere are no positives and I only have negative comments. I would give the rating as (- 5*)\nHere are my concerns:\n1) The product was not delivered as per the scheduled time. I was supposed to get the product before 12PM and I got the product finally around 5PM after making 20+ calls to Flipkart.\n2) The worst part stars from here: Technicians came around 7PM and opened the box and found out that TV stand was missing and they could not install the TV.\n3) I had to make another 20+ calls to Flipkart for the missing part. They said it is not their problem and I have to ask Cloudwalker (the TV maker) for the missing parts.\n4) I called Cloudwaker support and they asked me to sort this out with Flipkart for a replacement TV.\n5) Flipkart team said they don't have the stock and I had to wait until I get the replacement TV. They even denied to refund the amount saying there is no defect in the product and its just a missing component.\n6) Now I have the CloudWalker 43Inch Full HD Smart TV (The so called SMART) which is of no use and Flipkart customer service team in not ready to take the TV and provide the refund.\n7) I wasted almost 1.5 days of my energy taking to Flipkart and Cloudwaker service team for an explanation which resulted in just a waste of time. I literally had to fight with Flipkart customer support team for a full refund which they said it will take 4 to 5 business days for them to arrange for a pickup and then do the refund. Now I have to wait for few days for Flipkart to pick the defective TV and get the refund processed.\n8) Overall my experience with Flipkart and The CloudWalker TV is horrible. I will never buy anything from Flipkart agin and will also deactivate my account soon.\nDate:03/10/2017:\nI have changed the rating from -5* to 4* now. This rating is not for Flipkart but for the CloudWalker TV.\n\n1) Filpkart team was not ready to help me with the missing part and said it will take 3 to 5 business days to get a replacement TV. Once the sale is done, they don't care about the customers.\n2) They never tried to resolve my issue and instead they canceled my order and initiated the refund and pickup of my TV from my house. Looks like Flipkart's intent was not to sell this TV.\n3) In the meantime, I got a call from Cloudwalker head office and they assured to send the missing part by expedite shipment and apologized for the inconvenience caused.\n4) Customer support from CloudWalker is extremely awesome. They would have called me at least 10 times and apologized for the missing part.\n5) They sent the technician to my house immediately to help me get the TV wall mounted in less that 2hrs time.\n6) It was like a running commentary where they were updating me on the status. I was in office and they were constantly updating me on the installation progress.\n7) It is so unfortunate that they are not selling the product directly or through other sites.\n8) Coming back to the TV. Picture quality and sound quality is really good. However, it takes more than a minute to boot. this is definitely a negative one.\n9) Documentation / user manual is not clear and its really difficult to change the password of the user. Still figuring it out. Have to call them and get a quick overview again.\n10) As mentioned earlier, my 4* rating is for CloudWalker and It will always be -5* for Flipkart.\n\nWill provide more feedback on the product in the coming weeks.",
            "Very good smart TV...few features needs upgradation:\n1) It takes long startup time.\n2) It starts on home screen but as we normally watch Set top box which is on AV input...so by default it should start in AV input where it was switched off.\n3) While watching YouTube or USB picture controls are disabled and we cannot change colors,contrast etc.\nPlease do these modifications in software so that we the initial purchasers of this good TV can also be upgrade to new version.\nThanks",
            "I ordered the TV next day Flipkart delivered, as soon as delivered the engineer also came for installation. When the engineer opened the box the screen has broken. I was so disappointed. I called Flipkart and asked for replacement. That one took 5 days. I got a replacement TV for that also delivery and installation both came same time. When we open again the frame was not in the correct position. The engineer some how fixed. But I am not satisfied. So I asked for again replacement. But this time no option for replacement so they refund the amount and it took 5 days.\n\nSo the conclusion is Flipkart did wonderful job. They did amazing support to me. I am very much satisfied. But now I don't have TV so I can't say about the performance. But one thing I can say is packing should improve from Cloudwalker.",

Just like cheap. 1*\n3, Not a great picture quality.. Just like HD Not full HD.\n4, Voice (speaker) worlds Worst worst worst Audio, Audio out also. Not supporting with my multimedia speakers n my headphones too. Unable to listen dialogs clearly.. My CRT TV Is 100000 times better than cloud walker. - 1000*\n\n\n5, there is screen mirror option. Options is there actually.. But not connected with my MI NOTE 4.\n.\n\nFRIENDS Finally m telling.. If this TV Comes with below 20k then proceed other wise just keep away..",
            "ordered this 43 smart tv on 8th April 2018 got it on 11 April at Hamirpur HP but found its screen broken....after 20 days process of return & replacement finally got new Smart tv on 1st May 2018....jeeves engineer provide good service of free installation & Demo......Picture quality excellent....Sound is good...mirror cast good....Android version old 4.2...and U tube & remote mouse also not works...properly.....But overall its good purchase in this price......",
            "Though I wasnt sure about investing any money in a new brand.. i was pleasantly surprised by the specs on this TV. The superb part was the service displayed by Flipkart.. I ordered the TV at 8 pm and it was there at home the next afternoon before 1.. Simply superb.\n\nThough its been just a day since it arrived, I am enjoying the smart features it provides. The picture clarity is very good and sound could have been much better. However, plug it into a home theatre system and you have the problem solved. The interface is easy to understand too.\n\nAll in all, happy with the product quality and the service extended. Totally value for money.",
            "Initially felt its a risk in buying this product though specs are competitive but here are my first impressions, Pre-purchase technical support from \"cloudwalker\" customer care is good and flipkart one-day delivery, installation without any further delays felt company's effort in positioning their product.\n\nComing to the product-\n1) Product packaging & Build quality is decent.\n2) Picture & Sound Quality stands up to the expectations\n3) Smart features are really cool\n4) Super Remote really complements this product\n5) Technical support from CloudWalker in understanding TV features are pretty impressive (Called once, Support from second line support executives made really understand the features well).\n\nNegatives:\n1) Documentation needs to be improved to really understand how to use the features effectively.\n\nOver all recommended product at positioned price & initial impressions are good and happy with product.\n\nHope product will be reliable and wish to see the same level of customer support in long-run.",
            "After looking at some reviews and with a cramped budget in my pocket. I wanted to buy a TV that would provide me a good display, decent sound and fantastic smart features offered by big players in this segment. It satisfied all of them within my budget.\nPicture : 4/5\nSound : 3.5/5\nWorth a buy considering the above ratings. Hope this helps for the buyers. Happy Entainment !!!",

            "This is the honest review that you can trust and rely on.\nIt is a budget tv at range of 28k full hd led tv\nIt is loaded with features like air mouse, smart features like in built wifi and apps.\nBut the loading and buffering is time consuming and on youtube app it maximum plays at 720p only\nThe remote control consumes alot of battery, my fresh battery provided by the company got over in first 7 days of use as the bluetooth feature of air mouse consumes it.\nNow ive put a pair of Duracell batteries. Hope they last long enough ! FingersCrossed\nIt provides 2 HDMI slots & 2 USB slots out of which 1 is permanently gonna be used and blocked by air mouse receiver port.\nThe corners and surrounding of tv panel is plastic low quality built so its quite sensitive and gets scratched easily if contacted by sharp objects like I got my corner of tv scratched by a slight touch of my wrist watch.\nAnyways all in all\n28k is totally worth the price.\n2 days before the promised date it was delivered and installed.\nSo please buy if you have a tight budget.\nMy views on:\nDisplay : 4/5 ( Theres slight backlight bleed, its not pitch dark like the quality you get on Sony or LG or Samsung product, but an acceptable one due to the company and price range)\nSound : 4/5 ( Total of 100 volume bar, I dont need to cross 60 as I have installed the tv in my room and its quite decent and loud and clear)\nUser Friendly : 5/5 ( Due to access of fast and quick air mouse)",

Only prob I faced is there is a lag in the screenmirror with iPhone. Overall best android tv HD quality is that if Sony. Please go for it. This has Apple TV inbuilt. Smartest tv.",
            "I was looking to buy SMART / Android TV and did a lot of research before nailing down to CloudWalker.\nPlease don't get confused between SMART and Android TV. SMART may not be Android but Android would be SMART :-)\nI had visited various Electronic showrooms where i could find other Android TV which priced around 50K+.\n\nOther options?\n\nBuy normal LED FHD TV + casting device\n\nIn the same budget i was getting CloudWalker with Built-In WIFI with Android OS (8 GB storage +1 GB RAM).\n1+1 year warranty gave me confidence, in case anything happens to TV as other bands (Sony, LG) was only giving 1 year warranty.\nFK delivered TV on time but installation vendor Jeevas took time /multiple follow-ups to get it installed.\nLikes\n======\n- Android OS\n- Out of 8 GB , 5GB storage is available for installing Apps which is enough for TV.\n- Colors, brightness, contrast is good.\n- Switching between Apps and TV is easy.\n- AirMouse - This gives flexibility is using mouse in any direction.\n- Cshare Apps - You can Cast Media files, Control TV using Mouse and use phones Keyboard, open Apps, Cast Camera on TV, Mirror TV on phone.\n- Support - I am impressed with support provided by CloudWalker team. They quickly answered my queries and helped a lot.\nDislikes\n========\n- Poor Packaging - There was no bubble wrap and protection on FRONT and BACK side of TV in box.\n- Poor TV manual- It did not had steps for configuring TV and explaining the features. its very basic.\n- One USB port blocked for AirMouse USB dongle. So you will only have 1 USB available for use.\n- TV boot time is around 50-1 min sec.\n- USB ports are located on back right side of TV, so its difficult to access port - I am thinking to buy a USB extension cable for same.\n- Outdated Android version ( this comes with Android 4.4 where other brands are at least running on Android 5.5)\n- Less RAM - 1 GB feels bit less when you try to close Apps / open Apps but its manageable.\n- Slow Casting mobile screen to TV using Cshare.\n-\n\nTips\n====\nPicture and Sound -\nIf you are like me who found TV screen is very bright then you can define the Brightness, Contrast, Colors\n- Select TV AV option on remote\n- Now look for button with 3 lines on remote below Volume keys on remote\n- This will open SCREEN SOUND options.\n- Select the User option and define the levels as per your preference.\nNow you can use this setting from remote using \"PictueMode\" ( 2nd row on remote)\nSimilarly you can adjust Bass , Treble Surround Sound etc from SOUND options. This has made lot of improvement when listening to Music and News.\n\nApps\n=====\nSo far i have HostStar, Voot , YTKids, TubiTV (HD quality English movie's).\nYou should have high speed Internet connection to enjoy Live Streaming on TV ( I am using 40 MBPS connection).\nIn this budget this is one of the best Android TV available in market. You need to be bit tech Savvy to fully understand and use this TV.",
            "good product, delivered in tym, installation completed in same day... picture quality is excellent , sound quality is average, over all under 25k, it's valuable product... Rating - 8/10",

            "I have used this TV for 5 days and i am reviewing about this product .\nThis TV is best TV in this price ..As we go to specifications..\nPicture quality is good\nSound is some what less as we connect home theater we can get rid that\nIf we want to cast screen we need to download an app and we should cast and in that app we can use it as keyboard,casting and etc..\nIn remote there is a wireless mouse facility which we need not purchase a wireless mouse.\nThis has internal memory 8GB which is more enough for TV\nBetter buy this TV ...Firstly after purchase we somewhat disappoint but after using some days we love this and we will be very happy....",
            "I am happy with the product . Demo was not appropriate and the person who came for demo was not technical sound and not able explain the things.\nSet up box technical team said your cloud TV needs software update whereas you can connect your TV directly. Currently we are pressing HDMI button all the time.\nRequest please send your technical person for proper demo and updation of software.\nRegards,\nNarayan",
            "After 1 month of use..\nPicture quality very nice..\nSound quality is ok..\nOne of the best feature of smart tv is screen mirroring bt you need two wifi devices at the same time to connect screenmirroring..\nAir mouse some time lag..\nWifi connection with tv is very nyc..\nOverall a good product at this price range apart from above mentioned issues..",
            "Wow...amazing.the best smart TV at the price.awesome quality.very happy with the delivery.delivery was on time.and TV was installed on the same day.here is my points for the following qualities.\nVideo quality=5/5\nAudio quality=4/5\nInternet access=5/5\nFeatures-5/5\nRemote connectivity-5/5\nThe best feature is air mouse",
            "Bought this TV because of the tag \"SMART TV\" ,But the only smart about this TV is the remote. it's one of the best smart remote on the market.\n\n- Buy this TV if you are to use it only for watching Dish TV channels.\n- Sound is average, Picture quality is not bad for its price.\n- BUT IF YOU HAPPEN TO BUY THIS TV INORDER TO USE INTERNET CONNECTIVITY THEN DON'T.. DON'T BUT IT !!!\n- Since the RAM is almost negligible the video that you can play online are never 1080p or HD, it will keep buffering on and on, Even after buffering the TV still takes time to process the video and play!\n- Normally a 4 minute HD music video will last a good 8minutes as it will keep buffering (Not because of Poor internet connectivity)\n- Moreover the Remote App which is suppose to work seamlessly from your smart phone ain't working. it just won't Pair.\n- The EXPERIENCE that I'm looking for in simply not there but then again if you only watch Dish channels and don't really use Internet on this TV then go for it.",
            "I would say that it is a very bad product. I am writing this review after an year of using this TV. All I would say about this TV is, it is cheap. Agreed. But is it worth it? Definitely not. Why? Let me first discuss about the pros. It has an exceptional air mouse (which also absorbs a lot of battery power, and hence be ready to change it frequently), it is android powered and hence almost all apps work good on this. The picture quality is average to good.\nNow lets come to the aspects which makes it bad. The sound is pathetic (I also find the same problem with almost all the Flat screen TVs). The wifi reception is very weak (Though my Wifi router is placed just beneath the TV). Every online video has a lag. Technically there all a lot of dropped frames. Hence watching online content in YouTube, Netflix or Hotstar is terrible. I notified this with the technical team. They were kind enough to even replace it with the new TV. I would bow down for the service that cloud walker did and the same to the flipkart service as well. But the problem was not with one TV. Every TV has the same problem.\nMy suggestion. If this TV was not Smart, I would have rated 4 stars.\nVerdict:\nGet a even bigger screen TV without smart features and invest on a ChromeCast.",
            "paisa WASOOL hai bhai.....in very low budget very smart tv...we are happy....thank you flipcart....instalation man also nice guy...he work properly on fitting tv on wall...thank you...",
            "Tv is all fine... Good features for a cheap price. The smart TV feature works fabulously. Response is fast. I am happy with the product. What I am unhappy about is no one came to install the TV at my place and I had to work everything myself. Hence disappointed a little with flipkart.",
            "The product is not not up to the mark all is good but sound quality is very much low and not clear picture quality is ok but is u want to use this tv with ur set top box then dont buy this bcoz the picture quality is not adaptive to set top box nor we can adjest in setting you have to see blure quality.",

            "As a full HD Led TV, it works perfectly. The Smart TV option is alright, casting on screen has its lag issues and not many apps work as seamlessly. For the price range, it's a decent purchase",

            "A decent TV in this medium prce range . As expected from its price not is not a premium product although it can add attraction to your drawing room just in little money .\n\nAbout sound quality -\nIt has 5 sound modes out of which one mode is the user mode where you can set every detail of the sound like bass , balance , treble etc . But even after many attempts and minor and major adjustment you will miss something in the sound clarity .\nIt means that the sound quality is ok . If its not very bad then its not a very good even.on a scale of 5 i would give 2 for sound quality.\n\nAbout pictures quality :-\n\n\"Amazing\" - Thats the one word for the picture quality. While watching this you would not feel that you are watching a budget tv . It will give you viewing experience like any other premium high end televisions.\n5 out of 5\n\nAbout smart function :-\nQuite simple and decent . Some apps may take time to load but they run almost smooth except for some certain situations.\n3/5",

I am a first time buyer of smart tv",
            "I will update an honest & brief review on the CloudWalker Cloud TV 109cm (43) Full HD Smart LED TV purchased from Flipkart.\n\n1. The delivery was within the stipulated time period\n2. The installation of product was successful.\n3. Cloud TV with build and features seems to be very lucrative but my thoughts changed after NOT able to use the product even after delivery.\n4. Initially in first two days, the TV remote stopped working and hardly any connected device can be operated through TV buttons. Later 3rd \u2013 4th day, the TV screen started showing several lines and blurred images.\n5. After initiating the replacement, the technician visit happened immediately. A \u2018Jeevas\u2019 technician visited the place and submitted his feedback on the complaint. To my surprise, I must say it took more than 10 -15 days for execution of the replacement request @ Flipkart. So, friends replacement @ Flipkart is not easy, it\u2019s really a challenge.\n6. The height of the harassment is when the replacement product delivered against the problematic product is again faulty.\n7. The Cloud TV delivered is not booting after successful installation. Again, second complained was launched immediately after installation of the Cloud TV followed by \u2018Jeevas Engineer visit\u2019. The engineer made several attempts but the Television did not boot and he agreed that the TV set is faulty.\n8. On enquiry @ Flipkart, every time, it is understood that till date, Flipkart Officials do not have any update on its technician visit.\n9. Later, Cloud TV asked to share a video first for the issues in TV.\n10. Friends, I am still struggling for the refund of this faulty TV brand, so if you are buying Cloud TV, Be ready to Struggle even if it gives you a Lifetime warranty.\n11. If I would have space to upload the video, I had surely shared it to you all. However, you may contact for the actual video.",
            "The delivery was very quick from Flipkart and so the installation. The picture quality and sound quality are far better than any other branded tv's out in market. its the latest in all TV 's.",
            "One word for this product \"AWESOME\". I have been using product for more than 10 days and below are some of ratings from my perspective.\n\nPicture quality: 5/5\nSound: 4/5\nNetwork Connectivity: 5/5\nTV Remote usability: 4/5\n\nSome of the features needs still upgrades. Like below are few listed:\n- TV boot time is around 10 sec. Need to be reduced.\n- 1 USB port is blocked by bluetooth mouse pointer. So you can use only 1 USB port.\n- Can not change picture color / brightness / contrast while watching movies from pen drive.\n- Sound is average. You can hear clear disturbance when volume is 100%.\n- Lot of keys in TV remote, due to which remote is too big.",
            "So after a big confusion whether to go for a fresh brand in television series, or not, i decided go for cloudwalker. The delivery was done as per committed date. Installation agency contacted promptly on the very same day and the technician comes in and mounts the TV. The build quality and asthetics are really great.\nThe thing which went WRONG is TV REMOTE. The Navigation and Selection keys are non-funtional. The complaint was lodged on day 1. Now the real issue as expected came with after sales service. Very PATHETIC and SLOPPY. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. Funny it was as, technician just went back saying that even he doesn't know what will happen next.\nA NOTE to CLOUDWALKER - I don't think it is right to get your product returned just for a remote .I hope flipkart helps me resolve the issue soon.\n\nNOTE to FLIPKART- Nothing felt like 'FLIPKART EXCLUSIVE' or for the matter 'FLIPKART ADSURED'\n\nUser experience will be shared if my problem gets solved. \u270c",

            "One word No. Do not buy this becuse, android which is running on this TV's are very old. They don't even have an update schedule and ETA for update. Most of the play store video apps are not supposed like hotstar Jio apps etc. If they have an update plan then only buy this.\n\nEdit: Got two updates, another one on the way it seems. Hope for good.

Since the beginning (August 2017), The issue is always with the remote. Within a month, It has stopped functioning which has been replaced with a new one after multiple follow ups with the customer care. But, Since last one month, The remote is again dead and smart TV has become dabba TV again. And, This time the so called Jeeves support team came and closed the ticket stating that remote needs to be purchased of worth 1500/- as the 3-month warranty period for remote is over.\nI'm a big fan of flipkart. As this TV is an exclusive product of Flipkart, I went for this TV without a second thought and it became a foolish decision. Whats the point of 2-year warranty for a TV when a faulty remote got 3 month warranty? R u doing TV Business or a remote business behind the scenes? I'm highly disappointed with the remote and customer service and I wont be recommend it for sure for anyone who want to go for a smart TV.",

First the sound went; after several complaints an engineer came. He said there was nothing wrong and went away. Two days later, the TV stopped altogether. The same engineer came, opened the set and said one part was defective. He said it would take 7-8 days to replace and went. Ever since, I have been chasing this company to honour its warranty commitment. After 3 weeks of being fobbed off with assurances, I have still to get resolution. Last week I was told a senior engineer would inspect the set but there is no sign of him My advice - please do not buy Cloud Walker products.
