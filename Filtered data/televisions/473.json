            "I have purchased the TV on FK as it was on deal, otherwise I would have bought it here itself.\n1.Great Display at this price. Pictures look clear and crisp and color balance is good.\n2. I have seen TCL, SANYO, Micromax, Philips, Videocon and VU has amazing built with amazingly thin back panel and good quality of Plastic. Remote quality is also decent.\n3. The sound is not great on this TV, as the price paid is not much I would just ignore the sound at the moment.\n4. As Menu could have been better and while playing movies from USB, if you stop it starts again from start, also to reach a point you need to either forward or remember the lapse time where you left.\n5. Most of the ports are in Side which need regular connectivity. 2 USB, 2 HDMI which are well spaces, so that I plug in my Chrome cast and Fire TV at a time.\n6. 60 Hz, which is good for this price. Higher refresh rate means more smooth rendering and it fails at few places when I played a Blue ray/4K video with slow camera panning colors overlap, not a big failure at all. No impact on Fast moving scenes and Gaming.\n7. Works well with PS3 for smooth game play, CHROMECAST connected without any issues and great picture on full HD rendering\n8. The installation took 3 days of time and I am quite disappointed with multiple follow ups\n9. 1 Years warranty is good and competitive\n\n10.Great VALUE for MONEY. VU is a good brand and is offering good product at best price.\nFinal Verdict \u2013 Go for it, if you are looking for a good picture quality with great sounds and have a Budget constraint\nI hope my review was helpful!",

            "I bought this Vu led tv (model no. H40D321) from flipkart on 21.09.2017 and installed on 23.09.17. On 10.1017 , suddenly there was a sound of small burst in the tv and the display went off. Thereafter, i switched off the tv and switched it on again a visible mark on the screen appeared. I lodged a complaint regarding the incident with Vu customer care vide no.133926. On 12\n10.17, the engineer visited my residence and i narrated the whole thing to him but he said that u have damaged the display to which i replied that there is not even a single scratch on the screen from outside, if anything was hit on it there would have been some kind of impact mark on the screen. He further said that the display cannot be replaced. I am very disappointed with the customer service. I bought this led tv on 21 september 2017 with high hopes from Vu but customer service is awful. I feel cheated and would never recommend vu led tvs to anyone. I had also used lg samsung led tvs who had better customer service. I would not suggest the customers to buy vu led tvs. So freinds, dont go for cheap rates rather go for brands like lg samsung sony. Utterly disappointed. I bought the led tv on 21 sept 2017 for Rs 18499 but all my money has is wasted as vu customer care has informed me that fault is yours.\n\nNikhil Dogra",

            "Definitely a big Deal \ud83d\udc4f ! @21999 (VU 39 FHD)\nGuys this TV I got on June 18. Until now its completely fine. And the quality of the TV is on par with the other branded products like Samsung/Sony with respect to the picture quality especially the HD channels are too good.And even the frame of the TV is so thin that it looks like a premium TV.\n\nEven the extended warranty you can get from Jeeves for additional 2 years for Rs 2150. So you get a total of 3 years warranty. Just go for it\n\nWill add more details after some time...!",
            "I have booked TV on 25 Sep 17 for Kanpur U.P. in 18400rs.. delivered on 01 oct 17 at 12 pm packing was extremely good.. and installed on 02 oct 17 at 11 am. I'm satisfied with delivery and installation.. 5/5\nNow comes on TV..\nBuild quality- 4/5 totally plastic.. which is not give u gazab look..\nPicture quality- 4/5 best in this price.. but not superb.. u ll feel ur self wn u ll see Sony and LG picture quality.\nSound quality- 3/5 VU have too improve here.. Bcoz sound is loud enough for 15x15 room.. but not clear.. ( which my mammy complaining )\nConnectivity- 4/5 DTH is working fine.. While connecting with 3.5 MM headphone jack to home theater 5.1 .. humming sound is coming.\n\nPros..\nEverything in this price range is just Wow.. I belong to a small town Kanpur.. where ppl don't go for new brands easily..\nGoogle Cromecast 2 is working superbly ( screen mirroring too )\nBezzels are very thin.. which give to Sony 43W772E look.\nExtended warranty is a good deal ( if u have kids in home or used TV more than 4hrs in a day ) I have taken 2 years extended warranty in 1452rs.\nCons..\nSound is not good.. Quality of remote is very cheap.. and TV is lil bit thick..\nGo for it guys.. in this price range.. u ll not get this type of best deal. Thank you Flipkart.\nIf u find this review helpful..than give a thumbs up.. Thank you.",
            "At 22k it's a very good deal. Only Audio is an issue , it is not that loud. But yeah I am satisfied with it. Otherwise all other feaures etc are good. Played different different format of HD videos, performance is decent.\n\nLong term Review update:\n\nI am updating review after more than 1 year of use :)\nI am happy with the TV performance. It is really a good one with good quality.\nThanks VU TV to make such a beautiful product.\nMuch better than Samsung LEDs.",
            "The delivery of ekart and installation by Jeeves was excellent which was done on the same day of delivery. I was impressed by the quality of picture and sound in the tv. It's a perfect VFM product. Till now didn't find any cons for this product. Perfect LED TV for people switching from CRT TV to LED TV .",
            "Picture quality is too bad. Worse than LCD. Very poor refresh rate. You can see the glitchs when watching any even normal fast moving sports or song. You will see multiple ghost of the ball in case you are watching hockey or cricket. Picture quality in HD Channels is some what ok but in case of normal channels it is pathetic. You will see a very blurred image and watching any fast moving song or sports is a nightmare in normal channels. In HD picture is a little clear but poor refresh rate is very much visible in normal viewing. Had requested for return but Flipkart dont have any return policy. On complaining their technician visited and informed that this is only for HD viewing. Normal broadcasting channels are not supported by this TV. They informed that one will get only this much at this price. Their claim of refresh rate and A grade is complete falsh. Regretting buying this TV. I suggest go for a better brand and that too after seeing the actual product rather than trusting any one without seeing the product. Regretting the decision to buy this TV.",
            "The product is awesome. But, the service by flipkart is pathetic. No proper communication form the support team. The guy who came for installation seemed less knowledgeable about the product had limited reply to whatever I asked. If you are planning to by a separate wall mount, even the one suggested by flipkart, they are not allowed to install was mentioned by the Jeeves installation guy. I purchased this TV with additional warranty of 3 years, the support team, the delivery guys and the Jeeves guy had no proper answer as to how will I get the confirmation of the extended warranty. I still have no answer. Please call.",

            "The delivery of ekart and installation by Jeeves was excellent which was done on the same day of delivery. I was impressed by the quality of picture and sound in the tv. It's a perfect VFM product. Till now didn't find any cons for this product. Perfect LED TV for people switching from CRT TV to LED TV .",
            "Picture quality is too bad. Worse than LCD. Very poor refresh rate. You can see the glitchs when watching any even normal fast moving sports or song. You will see multiple ghost of the ball in case you are watching hockey or cricket. Picture quality in HD Channels is some what ok but in case of normal channels it is pathetic. You will see a very blurred image and watching any fast moving song or sports is a nightmare in normal channels. In HD picture is a little clear but poor refresh rate is very much visible in normal viewing. Had requested for return but Flipkart dont have any return policy. On complaining their technician visited and informed that this is only for HD viewing. Normal broadcasting channels are not supported by this TV. They informed that one will get only this much at this price. Their claim of refresh rate and A grade is complete falsh. Regretting buying this TV. I suggest go for a better brand and that too after seeing the actual product rather than trusting any one without seeing the product. Regretting the decision to buy this TV.",
            "The product is awesome. But, the service by flipkart is pathetic. No proper communication form the support team.

            "Very happy that my Tv got installed today. Abt product, itz very good but you have to have a hd channel to enjoy it fully, sound is a slight drawback bt if u hav a home theater itz will be double awesome. Coming to the delivery itz horrible, expected delivery is on 4th April however no one has contacted on that day from logistics side. In order status they did mention like \"Unable to reach customer\" I didn't receive any calls even miss call alert also. Delay is fine bt they should not blame on customer for their delay which is not a genuine thing. Installation expected is on 5th however the same problem has happened no one called. Today 6th they called and installed it. Itz working cool. Reasonable price. For flipkart 5stars, logistics 2 stars, installation 4 stars. My suggestion is just go for Vu instead of MI. Coz MI is new and not sure abt the product also personally I don't hav a trust on MI products since so many problems in Phone itself I have heard about MI.",

            "Everything was fantastic and the installation and delivery was in the same day.. that was the best part.. about the TV.. ITS AMAZING...!!!!",
            "Very nice tv",
            "It's hooked up as a HDMI-connected monitor, the viewing distance is ~10 feet. For me the budget was critical, and the distance meant the largest available (cheap) 32\" PC monitor would still be too small. First the good stuff:\n\n1. The build quality is above average at this price level. The casing doesn't creak and the gaps are uniform and small.\n\n2. The sound quality is usable for basic YouTube and Prime Video. Will not shake the earth, but the vocal quality is intelligible and there is a coaxial output to hook up a receiver or DAC. This reduces the amount of cabling, and provides the option of not using the internal speakers at all. The coaxial is a nice unexpected bonus,\n\n3. Picture quality is above average for internet video, and so it will be for satellite TV as well. The colour is about average but the panel itself is probably very narrow gamut. For broadcast this will probably not be an issue.\n\n4. The price itself is very low. It is well below the price of any other 'branded' TV and the brand itself has been around for a bit,.\n\n5. Flipkart delivery and service was outstanding, a marked improvement from what it was six months ago. Very impressed with the quick turnaround - I doubt a local store purchase would have been as efficient.\n\nNow the bad stuff:\n\n1. The front panel indicator light is way too bright. It actually hurt after ten minutes so I had to tape it over with some foam so I could actually look at the screen.\n\n2. With the screen blanked, there is enough backlight bleed to light a reasonably sized room. The power LED is not really needed once the TV is on - and the black levels are correspondingly poor. This is an issue with almost every IPS display including professional ones, but it's usually not this bad. There are lots of bright areas at the periphery, indicating poor polariser performance.\n\n3. The colour while good enough for broadcast, falls short of a proper 8 bpp target. The internal engine is either not using FRC, or the panel is even lower grade than I initially thought. The gamut is also very narrow, the Red is very far off target and the Green is poor - though better than red. Blue is the only colour that is on target, but part of that may be due to the bluish backlight, which is a feature of almost all cheap TVs. The quality of the LEDs in the backlight is very poor, leading to a gamut tilted towards blue. After calibration the colours came closer to the target but you can't fix inherent panel issues this way.\n\n4. The processing engine in the TV is hyperactive, always trying to sharpen or enhance the image, but it trips over its own tail at times. There is some amount of resampling that makes games respond very poorly, with slow frame transitions in low contrast areas. The panel is touted as 60Hz, which is probably the drive frequency for the backlight. The engine is not capable of over 30Hz internally and the result is a light stutter/blur when moving between areas. I suspect this will be a problem in very fast or dark scenes as well.\n\n5. The weakest part of the TV is the firmware. The software fails to save the user-selected zoom setting, which means you have to manually scale from your display, or live with a bit of overscan at the default 16:9 setting. Broadcast and console users will probably not even notice, but those who have it hooked up to a HTPC will either have to rescale the display resulting in loss of 1:1 pixel mapping, or set the zoom every single power-up. The firmware also offers no options for custom white balance, which would have gone a long way in fixing the TVs off-colour gamut to some extent. Whereas the processing engine and panel cost money - and thus can still be forgiven in a TV at this price, there is no excuse for poor firmware.",
            "i am writing this review after about 2 months of usage. just bang for your buck. the picture quality is great. viewing angles are good. no black views or picture loss which i faced with my laptop screen. delivery was right on time. service and installation was on the very same day.

The picture quality of tv is great but in sd channels it looks little strecthed so you have to subscribe to hd channels for best experience. Sound is loud and superb. In all i can say that it was a good purchase at a price of 20000.",
            "Its a unrecognizable brand to majority, you need to explain why you bought it, yes the answer is quiet obvious, it's THE PRICE...\n\nDisplay\nNow coming to the most important part, this is an IPS panel and it has quiet good brightness with decent colors.. Not the sharpest or the richest.. I would have liked higher black levels but with the price and screen size I cannot really complain.. So overall its a joy to watch with decent colors punchyness with good brightness but also with bit low black...\nREAD MORE",
            "Loved watching it on HD, picture quality very good, some improvement could be done towards sound quality, not bad though. Within this price range, it's unbeatable. Overall a luxury TV, Must go for it...!!!",
            "Overall it\u2019s an excellent product in this price range. But USB media player has some issue regarding the aspect ratio. So for those who like to watch movies using USB, please note the below issue before buying the same.\n\nThere is no option to keep the source aspect ratio while using USB media player. It works fine with videos which are in 16:9 aspect ratio. In most scenarios we can see that source file of movies now a days are in 21:9 (or not in 16:9 exactly) and in these cases the videos looks vertically stretched in order to fit its 16:9 aspect ratio, creating distorted images. There is no option in menu to keep the Source Aspect Ratio, while using USB media player.\n\nIn order to update/fix the USB media player bug, I have logged a complaint with VU customer support with Call No. VU145701 dated 08 Nov 2017, but no updates as of now.",
            "Pros:\n- Excellent picture quality, comparable to top brands like Samsung and Sony.\n- remote and consecutive actions are responsive and fast\n- playing files from usb is pleasant experience (subtitles get detected automatically)\n\nCons:\n- average speakers, you should invest in good quality speaker, don't rely on 3.5mm port on tv, go for av/HDMI to 3.5 mm converter with splitter\n- it's not slim at all... In smaller rooms it may look weird hooked up on wall\n- my pendrive attached to USB port gets really hot...

            "I am fully satisfied.\n\nPros:\n\nThe display clarity is as good as many other popular brands' TVs.\n\nCons:\n\nThe EQ has only bass and treble. They could have provided other Hz as well.\n\nIn some branded TVs, when you connect an external speaker through the 3.5 audio out, you will have the option to choose whether the TV speaker should still sound or should be muted. Because, you don't want to watch TV serial in 5.1 surround speaker, but you will wish to watch your favorite Hollywood movie in it. You cant just keep plug and unplug the audio out every time. (1) It is not easy to reach the plug, (2) It will damage the port. Using this feature, you can just keep the external speaker plugged in all the time, and while watching serial, you can turn on TV speaker and for movies turn on the surround speaker and turn off the TV speaker. Since the slim LED TVs cant accommodate huge speakers, pretty much every TV has very average sound (And no bass whatsoever) and for this reason people tend to go for external speaker. Therefore this feature is a basic need.\n\nI am saddened to see this TV does not have this feature, even many other popular brand TVs don't. I wish VU reads this and provides this basic feature in all the TVs.",

            "It was a good transition for me from 32\" Samsung LED to 39\" Vu. To be honest, the first thing that attracted me was the price tag, and topped with the SBI debit card offer this was an offer hard to miss. It was really a deal at Rs 18500. To be safe, I had also purchased a 2 year warranty from Jeeves, just in case :) . Also the reviews from Vu customers prompted to go for it.\n\nThe following are my observations after 2 days of use:\nPROS:\na. Delivery super fast, and the installation by Jeeves was very professional.\nb. Very thin bezel, giving it a sleek and premium look.\nc. Colour rendition is top class.\nd. Plays all video formats. (Played Avatar bluray rip, and the experience was awesome)\ne. Interface very friendly.\nf. Build quality is very good - Comparably to Samsung or Sony.\n\nCONS:\na. The HDMI ports seem difficult to access, I have to move the TV to change HDMI cable.\nb. Sound is a major disappointment. The max volume is just OK for a medium sized room. Will not be sufficient for a bigger hall. This can be addressed with a speaker system though.\nc. Sound clarity could have been improved.\n\nHowever going by the price tag, the cons can be overlooked. The same size LED from Samsung or Sony would have been priced atleast 35 K or more. So I feel this was a good decision. I hope Vu does not let me down in future ;)",

The SD channels are not pleasant to watch though watchable. If you opt for HD channels then you have a sweet deal. Rest you can watch from pen drives ,hard drives,fire stick or chromecast.

Clarity is good, especially if you've HD channels, some of the formats like.mkv, files are showing unsupported, which is a let down, sound clarity is craky if you keep the TV in full volume, as my father has bit hearing issue, he wants TV in high volume, but if we raise the volume after certain limit, words are that very much clear, overall for the price we paid it's value for money.",

Then , we decided the spot but there comes another twist since there was Shelf in the other side, those engineer said it is not possible.\nThen finallly, we decided to keep it on the table. Engineers took extra mile in lifting and bringin our old - unused - heavy weight table from Varanda to Hall and placed TV on it.\n\nSince it was only Local Cable, the quality of pics was not good.

Overall satisfied.\nThe TV is very good at the price I have paid. This is 39\" TV and you can't get this size TV for the said cost. Overall the TV is very good . I have used the settings of contrast, color and brightness in such a way that the picture in most of the channels look very natural [ in some channels it may look saturated as their standards are different...] The sound of the TV could have been at least 10W+10W RMS, instead of 7W+7W. One thing I have done for enhancing the sound output is, I have increased the TV sound to 100% and the input signal from the STB of dishtv is controlled to get the desired level of the sound volume.\nJeeves service person had come to install the TV as per my convenience. Thanks to Jeeves and Flipkart.",

I had my parents coming to my new house so even after i had plans to buy the TV later, I immediately ordered it as my father is so fond of watching the TV. But unfortunately, it was delivered on the day when they were going back (so sad) almost 12 days after the order was placed. Secondly, installation person came next day and after installing I found out one of the USB port is not working and tried to contact VU directly but till now not able to reach them as their customer care number is not working. will try 1-2 more days and if it doesn't work, will get it replaced through flipkart.

            "Most of my relatives, friends and neighbour says me that I have a good knowledge of technology. So I want to share my opinion. First LED TV was launched by Samsung and then Sony says that TV which SAMSUNG launched is LCD not LED. But after some time all world knows about the power of LED resolution. After that Samsung and Sony developed LED by this their technology. By using Sony bravia engine, the quality of Sony is slight better than Samsung. But price is higher. LG was on 3rd rank amongst them. Later on LG starts using IPS display, which makes LG company absolutely winner from Sony a d Samsung. Friends viewing experience on IPS display is much much better, it reduces blurness if u are watching normal SD channel. But if r watching HD then it is superb and incredible experience. So now it's clear that we required a TV of IPS panel. Now the question is that, which brand we have to buy. Now friends if I cover 10 mobiles from top and downside of branded or chinese then it will be impossible to identify them, which is branded or chinese or Indian brand. It means now all are using standard and common component. So there is no issue to purchase Vu. You can't say Vu a small brand because this company doing so well in LEDs. My friends are using since last 1.5 years. If u don't have money problem, u go for major brands. I suggest u to go for LG now. But if u are a intelligent customer, then go for Vu.",
            "It's been over 2 months that i have been using this product. Let me brief you about my experience. Product was delivered as per the original schedule, installation was much quicker. I mean that the technician called up immediately after the delivery date and came an installed the set on the very next day. He as quite good in his work. He was informative, advised us as to what care / what precautions needs to be taken.\nTV is running smooth, picture and sound quality is good so far. I would say, that this tv is worth it's money.",

The panel is good but colour engine is good. I am professional colour correction specialists. The colours are not that accurate. Even if you customise colour user setting, you won't get that perfection. Audio is good, but voice clarity option is missing in the TV.",

Still went for it.\n\nThis is the review i have written after a months use.\nTV PRICE: SUB 20k TV 10/10\nHARDWARE QUALITY: 8/10\nLOOK : 8/10\nPICTURE QUALITY. : 9/10\nSOUND. : 8/10\nDELIVERY. : 9/10\nINSTALLATION. : 9/10\n\nFinal verdict.\nGo for it.

Delivery and installation was on time ....No complaints there. Unless you fancy big brands .... Vu experience is absolutely awesome !\n2 HDMI ports\n2 USB ports on side panel\nP.S. HDMI port is located on the back ...But I can live with that.",
            "The TV was delivered on time and also the person who fixed it was very helpful. It needs a stabilizer so that come with slight added cost. And the extended warranty too makes sense to purchase with reseller\nOverall the TV is really good with good display and output. Really happy with the purchase and recommend this product",
            "Considering the price point and picture quality it delivers, it is best.\nAlso Delivery and Installation was done on same time.\n\"It is better to buy tv with better picture quality than its smartness\" and this TV fulfill it completely.\nWe can make tv smart by external modules.\nRECOMMEND TO BUY.",
            "Using it for about a week. Very good picture quality and super slim bezel. Looks very premium. Worth more than the price I pay. I hope the on site services are good in case I need them. One slight concern is that the HDMI ports are at the back of the TV.gets difficult to attach cables when on the wall mount. The company should atleast provide 6 to 8 inch extension cables along with the TV to help out ..",
            "You get 39 inches of excellent Full HD (1920x1080p) display for the price of 32 inch so called branded TVs. There may be lesser number of connectivity options and this is not a smart TV. One can very easily buy a Android TV Box for around 3,000/- and make this TV also smart! If you connect a receiver or a good sound bar, the lesser connections do not matter.",
            "It's really better TV than Sony, Samsung or any in low budget. I was using Sony 40EX52 where TV got panel issue in just 3.3 year where extended warranty also didn't help me. I had bought Sony TV in 63k, which was wastage of money.\n\nOnly issue with VU is sound not match the other leaders, but overall performance is best with HD channels and normal channels.\n\nI bought this TV in 14k with 2 year extended warranty. Exchange offer.\n\nI would like to recommend everyone that just don't go with name and brand. Just look at your requirements like processing speed, direct or U or O led and smart or HD led only.",

I have connected with my computer using hdmi cable. The picture clarity is superb, sharp and perfect color combination. I bought this for Rs. 15999/- I couldn't get this deal anywhere.

            "This is manufactured in a way that it will work without any issue till its warranty period. This is where brands like Sony, LG stands tall in terms of durability when compared to new comers in the league. Though price for features is affordable for many, but don't expect that it should have life as such as branded TVs provide. Yes we can't predict life of any electronics but again when it comes to after service support, VU is horrible. When I called the technician, he simply said without dismantling and examining the TV to change the motherboard and it will cost Rs 6000. I don't know why I have to spend one fourth of Tv's cost just in 1 year of purchasing it.",

I have evaluated myself side by side.\nArrived in best condition with same day installation free of cost.\nby the way I am a professional computer graphic artist so I know about the depth,sharpness,hue,saturation and many different aspect of colors and this tv provides the best display in this price range and it is on par with any other brand which will cost you half a lakh",

            "I purchased this TV 3months back. nice audio and it can support upto 1080p Bluray videos also. not tried with 4k videos. Even I have connected with laptops. it's awesome TV and I have purchased this TV in Flipkart TV day deals with the cost of 17000. I loved this TV because of MIT invention.",
            "So far so good. The TV has been delivering as promised.\n\nThe exterior is well finished, sleek and the frame is relatively thin. The jacks and ports are at the posterior end, behind the LED panel; makes reaching out to them little difficult either on stand or wall fixed. Could had been better had a couple of regular use ports and jacks like USB and HDMI had been provided on the sides.\n\nPicture quality is decent in both HD & SD versions. Sound is decent for a standard bedroom size. Contrast is decent as well. The TV responds quickly to any new connection added. However, the on screen user interface is tad primitive, lackluster and little lagging. Could had been better designed and given better look and feel.\n\nOverall, I feel it's a steal deal at this price and value for money product that provides with all requirements that's available with any popular brand. Only time will say how it outperforms other brands, but until now it's a good TV to go with at this price range.",
            "This is the review after a month... First thing was, the vu is worth for our money. Picture clarity, sound, USB slots, HDMI all were good. Really the TV works good in its all features.\nAnd the delivery of flipkart is awesome... They were keeping their promise earlier before their mentioned time. Thanks flipkart.",
            "so it's been months using this TV. well working good - picture quality is great . I have attached my CPU with the TV - haven't faced any issues yet. happy with the purchase.",
            "I have been using it for over 3 months now. It is working as expected. Beautiful picture quality, design though audio output could have been better. Still I would say it is best budget LED TV. I think I didnt like is two HDMI ports are adjacent to each other and when you insert fire stick in one of them, you cannot put another cable to it. So the solution to this is that you need to buy an extension HDMI cable.",

Its not at all compromised against the big brands such as Sony or Samsung etc. A quality product from VU and definitely worth buying if you are looking for FHD TV. Very lightweight TV with a decent sound. All TVs anyways cant give you theater sound in 15 - 20 W sound output even if they claim.\n\n1 Star less is given considering new arrival of Smart TVs like MI and Thompson etc. at this price range. This TV is not a smart TV but this is what I wanted in Quality and for that MI and Thompson to be tested though.\n\nDemo and Installation was just troublesome with lots of calls and poor service but will keep this negative side of review as short !!!\n\nJust Go for the TV with competitive cost and uncompromised quality !!!",

But If your a quality maniac than go for branded and above range.\n\nEmits large amount of blue colour on picture but you can reduce it by setting mannual picture mode.\n\nRemote quality is not good.\n\n\nAs usual flipkart service was upto mark delivery was very satisfying and installation from jeevas was also done at the very same day just after 30 mins of delivery of tv. It was truly a wonderful experience.",
            "I am using this TV from last 1 month and sharing my feedback based on my experience..\n\nIt has a great picture quality. You need to have an HD set top box for enjoying the full HD experience. I am using Tata sky HD set top box and the output is just amazing.\n\nSound quality is descent. You can use any good home theatre system with this for a better experience.\n\nIt comes with a light weight and good build quality.\n\nFlipkart has delivered it on-time with no physical damage.\n\nIt is truly a value for money product. If you are looking for a low cost high definition TV, this is the right product for you.",
            "it's just fab , great picture quality , good sound all over worth spending money. u can get something better than this at such price",
            "Excellent TV for the price! Very good quality display with deep blacks and vibrant color. The only reason why I gave 4 star is the location of HDMI port which is not accessible from left or right side but TV has to be lifted little bit in order to reach it. Also it doesn't seem to be Made in India which another let down given that Vu claims to be Indian company!",
            "Nise tv... Great full hd display ... Worth the price ... Thank you Flipkart. Thank you vu.\n\nBy the way good Flipkart service \ud83d\udc4d",
            "Heeding the advice from my friends, I went for a larger size than 32\". And for my budget range of subpar 20k, this TV seemed very good.\n\nI went on and confirmed that an authorized VU service centre was there in my town and then opted for the extended warranty of 2 yrs ( total 3 yes) from Jeeves/Flipkart.\n\nFor me, the TV offers the below and I am satisfied:\nGood crisp display\nGood sound\n\nI got good service from Jeeves too.",

But ok with in this price range\nImage chops a bit towards left side.1cm atleast. Because of the covered plastic frame.Not a big problem.But i found this in my Tv.\n\nOverall i recommend this. Picture quality is very good.",
            "TV is excellent. Great value for money. Both picture and sound are great. But the problem is Flipkart delivery. I had to take a day off from work to receive this product as the delivery inspite of being scheduled will be as per ekart wish. Then comes the mind blowing installation which also is as per flipkart wish. To top it off, installation guy had no clue on wall mounting and first atempt was 2ft above what I mentioned. It's best if you can pick this TV from Amazon or offline if you get the same price.",

Installation team hounded us for conpleting the demo and Installation (which is a good thing), however, upon our request they only gave a demo and were to install at a later date. When we enquired about installing the television finally post completing other priorities of renovating, we were informed that additional charges will be applicale (while giving demo, they confirmed they will provide it whenever we want at no extra cost). Dont trust words of these guys.. They will be very sweet on your face and later turn their back.",

Delivered on next day and installation done on another next day.\n\nPicture quality - top class for this price\nFlipkart service - Excellent\nSound is little low though but we are not here to listen dj music. Just raise the volume on tv, thats simple.\n\nThis is just my initial impression after using 3 days.\nI will update my review after using it for sometime",
            "Overall the product is very good. The only laggging point is the TV's volume when u plug-in any USB stick for any movie or video. However, with the set top box you can increase the volume and it works fine. Will have to attach external speakers to get a good volume experience for movies and videos.",
            "No need demo. I installed the TV. It is excellent work of technology. I received it today. All that I hope that it has required durability. Thank you Flipkart!",

They have missed LAN cable, if they have included that as well it could have been better, but no worries you can buy Chromecast/Amazon Fire tv stick to enjoy the internet features and you can turn your tv in smart tv!!\n2. 4k videos are not supported\n3.

After delivery, Flipkart promptly booked appointment for installation and the installation engineer called came on time to install the TV on a wall mount. Full 5 stars for Flipkart service, delivery and installation management.\nComing to the product, the TV looks very neat with no frills in the front and a clean and thin bezel. The sound is good for a medium sized room. The colors are rich and just at right saturation levels. The real time dynamic contract is as good as any other TV for the leading multinational brands.\nHappy with the product so far.",

Except the sound output which is very ordinary rest all features are excellent.however a 2.1 sound system manages the show attached to ear phone output. Picture resolution in full HD is wonderful. Though it's a non smart TV but with chrome cast it becomes smart in a jiffy. Flipkart packing and delivery was excellent and so was the Jeeves installation of Pune done all in a day of ordering. Over all a decent deal during the RD sale. Highly recommended for budget conscious people.",

            "Though I found the product to be really good, I had a pathetic experience with Flipkart\u2019s delivery.\n\nI ordered this LED on an exchange offer. The product was delivered on promised date and the installation guy also arrived on the same day. However, when the LED was unboxed, the guy realised that the screen was damaged. In checking the box, he found a perforation covered with a tape- implying a deliberate attempt to conceal the damage. I was promised an exchange. So far so good.\n\nThe replacement date that was committed to me was 7 days ahead of this day. Calling the customer care to expedite the replacement date was unhelpful. Mind you- they had already taken away my existing LED as an exchange product. Basically I was left without a TV for a week - which included a long weekend - for no fault of mine. Again, I accepted this as my bad luck.\n\nNow the LED is delivered on promised date, and the installation is scheduled on the same day. I receive a call and the person on the other side says that the installation couldn\u2019t happen that day since the technicians had left for the day. Immediately thereafter I receive an SMS saying that \u201cAs per my request, the installation has been rescheduled\u201d. I had specially asked someone to stay back at home to receive the LED. I call up the customer care explaining the inconvenience I have been going through and the unethical nature of the reschedule request. The person says that I note your feedback and then went at length to explain me basically the business model of Flipkart- how it is a marketplace and does not have control on every part of the process. I tried explaining that his explanation isn\u2019t helping me solve my problem and that I at least deserve an apology- at least for the 5 times that I had to arrange someone to stay back at home. I was told that I could ask my \u201cbrother/ sister\u201d and that I need to be physically there to receive the product.\n\nWhat I can conclude from my experience is that Flipkart has no control over its logistic partners and customer service. If you are lucky (which I had been till now) then things go smoothly. If not, then Flipkart is unable to manage the exigency and you land up in a mess. Lesson learnt- Never order heavy appliances from Flipkart. Rather- AVOID Flipkart!",
            "Flipkart delivery was late by a couple of days due to Republic day holiday.\nMoreover, Jeeves provides technician here at Calicut, Kerala from angel electronics..i had a pretty bad experience earlier from people at angel electronics. Actually they are the reason for my new TV purchase.i know they are a bunch of crooks..so pretty much doomed on service part.\nAll that aside, Reviewing the TV after 2 days of continous usage...\n\n***Pros***\n1. Really light weight.\n2. TV does it's job more than well..superb clarity.. especially HD playback. Didn't find the sound clarity that bad... at par with most of those high end TV's selling out at nearly double this price i felt.\n\n***Cons***\n\n1. If you were to enable sound output both from TV and home theater/soundbar through optical cable taken out from the DTH, it goes completely out-of-sync...hence you'll have to either play sound through HDMI on TV and mute the home theater or do the other way round. Both together is a real mess and not an option.\n2. Jeeves service at Kozhikode, kerala is messed.. don't know about the rest of the country\n\nWill further update in two weeks time ..",
            "I bought this TV as part of Republic day sale and its delivered ontime.After using 2 days ,I am happy with the product.Its giving good quality pictures in HD quality.Considering the fact that ,I have got a FHD 39 under 15K ..Surely its a good Buy.\nI found few comments on sound quality, but seems to be OK for a Large room",

            "Awesome product, beyond expectations, worth to buy , but only one thing is to be that product should be genuine and we should get proper after sales services .",
            "Pros:\n-Product is good for the price. I took it in an exchange offer.\n-Weight of the TV is light and the bezel is thin so it makes the screen look big.\n-Various connectivity ports are easily accessible\n- Picture quality is pretty good for the price once all the crucial settings and calibration are done\n- The remote is of a decent size and has a decent feel to it.\n\nCons:\n- Many important settings in the TV are disabled by the company. We need to enter the service menu to enable these settings. Especially by default skin tones show a unnatural pink color (known as Pink Effect). This can be adjusted once you access the relevant settings via the Service Menu. Details on How to enter the service menu is easily available via Google.\n\n-A lot of buyers have complained about the sound and speaker quality and volume but they fail to understand that such thin Led TV will have a limitation in the size of speakers they can incorporate inside the body. You always have an option to use an external sound bar.\n\n- Another distinct negative is the cloudy white patches seen on the screen when there is no signal. At first it may seem as if the screen panel is faulty but once a signal is received and something comes on the screen the patch disappears.\n\nFkipkart service was great as usual. Pickup of old TV, delivery of new TV and installation was a breeze. All took place the very next day of booking the TV.",

            "Picture Quality : 4/5 , It supports almost all the available media format in my hard disk mp4 , mpeg4 , mkv ; also I am able to play .mp3 files , checkout jpeg photos , and text files. The picture quality with 1080p is ok to watch on a 39 inch screen , more than that would be better if you download or stream over internet via chromecast.\n.\nSound Quality : 3/5 , Not a sound box , you definitely need an additional home theatre to enjoy your favourite hollywood movies witu background effects and to listen to your favourite music. The sound quality is just considerable to watch daily hindi soaps or to watch bollywood movies which does not have much to do with background music.\n.\nPorts & Connectivity : 3/5 , Although this is not a smart tv , but you can always connect chromecast to make it smart , and can connect a bluetooth adapter to use bluetooth earphones. There are 2 usb ports available on the side which are easy to use. However the HDMI ports are at the back of the tv so much poorly located that you need to take the mounted tv out to plug your cords.\n.\nValue for Money : 3/5 , I bought it for 18,500 with 10% instant discount at one of my credit cards and I believe this could be the least price of this product , it cant be lower than that during this season. Here is my overall experience.\n.\nDelivery , Installation & Demo : 3/5 , Delivery was laye by a week. Otherwise the installation by jeeves was done the next day of delivery at my convinient time. Demostration of the technician was not so good.",

Also it plays all the video formats. I tried with mkv HEVC, it played fantastic with no. Lags or issues.\n\nComing on the sound, that everyone is complaining about, I must say for my room it is amazing. Yes if u have big rooms or halls, then the sound is definitely low for tht, you have to get an external sound bar.\n\nHaven't tried gaming on it yet, but I'm sure tht it would work just fine.\n\nI'm deducting 1 star just for the installation. Don't get me wrong, tv was installed the next day only. But the guy was in hurry, and was not courteous. So jeeves should work on tht.\n\nI would definitely recommend this TV to anyone who is on a budget. Trust me it won't disappoint you. Just Go For It.",

Doesn't supports 4k mp4 videos via USB.\n\nRefresh rate test is yet tk be done. I'll post it here once I try gaming via HDMI.\n\nSince this being new entrant in TV market it is suggested to opt for extended warranty alongwith this (don't buy it later it costs more).\n\n\nThe TV comes with a BEE rating of 4 star i.e 96KW/year which is amazing in this budget even Samsung and LG TVs don't have such ratings in this range.",

Audio is a problem like many said. Does not support many videos format, not even AVI format. Another disappointment. Plz Don't compare with branded item, as this is no match for to them. \"Remember you get what you paid for.\"",
            "I don't Know About Others But I'm Totally Satisfied With The Product very Good Picture Quality Sound is also Good enough",
            "I purchased this TV before 3 months and it is working fine without any issues. A good TV at a reasonable cost.",
            "Product seems good, clarity is nice if full hd content is played (obviously). Need to check for atleast 6 months before giving a perfect review so lets see... hope vu lives to that expectations after all i would love the indian company grow to an international level. Best of luck... jai hind",
            "I am writing this review after 15 days of viewing.Very good TV with Sony/Panasonic like picture quality. Sound is not as good as others but a multimedia speaker (sub-woofer system) will feel like cinema hall. SD channels are average but HD channels are mind blowing.\nInitially a wrong product was delivered but after few days flipkart has replaced the product. Lots of phone calls has to be made for installation.\nOverall satisfied.",
            "I purchased this TV during August 2017 , based on 1 week experience am satisfied with clarity ... working fine with Tata sky...\nCons:\n1.TV volume is bit low when you watch HD channel in Tata sky (sun music)..\n2.when connecting home theatre to TV is not upto the mark..\n3.mkv video format is not playing when the video is played via usb..",
            "Great product, real value for money. Best product if you're not looking for something fancy but instead want solid entertainment. Four stars for the poor shipping and service of flipkart.",

            "Good sound good clarity and fast delivery and installation I really satisfied buy this product",
            "So far so good. I have been using it since two weeks.\nPros: - Attractive price for 39\" LED tv\n-Good picture quality\n-Speaker volume is decent for normal room\nCons:- wall mount that comes along with tv is just for one time installation. i.e. you cannot reuse it once you detach it in case yiu want to shift your tv to new place.\n- All the ports are on the back of the tv panel. it would have been good if usb, hdmi and headphone jack were in front below.\n\nOverall a good product at this price",
            "We were not happy with shipping as we received the product after a long chase. Support staff is helpful but guess few things are beyond their control. Would have been better if there are processes to support customer rather.\n\nInstallation from Jeeves is more than perfect, arrived before scheduled date and was performed professionally. Many thanks to Manish Kumar and team",
            "Vu TV is much better than the reputed with very reasonable price. I advice the new purchasers to purchase Vu without any doubts. Best TV at less price.",
            "A very nice product with good display and sound system. The delivery was as scheduled. The team from Jeeves also reported in time and did a satisfactory job. At Rs 22999, it is much cheaper than the contemporary branded products available in the market. Though they might be better but given the huge difference in the cost, the subject LED TV is indeed a value for money.",
            "I will give 5 \ud83c\udf1f. Very nice TV . I purchased it at 21k , at this price it is the best TV. Picture quality is good. Flipkart service was not good but overall it was a good experience.",
            "Wonderful amazing Led tv. But the delivery persons handled very roughly in front of me. They won't carry safely and didnt know the value of the product. Courier delivery only not satisfied. Otherwise value of money.",
            "very good product compared with other branded product like LG, Sony of higher price. You can save 10 to 15 k and enjoy the same satisfaction .",
            "After 10 days of usage I feel that it works pretty well and the picture quality is quite good. Sound quality is average. But this price it is a valuable product. Go for it.",
            "Flipkart delivered the product in next day of post purchase with the same day of installation. The service was very professional.\n\nThe VU is worth for the money, good clarity, good sound condition. Go for this product from flipkart.\n\nGood Job Flipkart.",
            "Good value for money in this price range. It's just right size that I expected. the connection to Set top box, USB, HDMI cables is very seem less.

            "I bought this product recently, let me review this product fully.After lots of research i found this is the best value for money tv i came across, pros are-1)picture quality superb,black colours shows Complete black, i like the colour reproduction and contrast ratios, you need to upgrade your setoff box tu hd, sd channels looks a bit pixelated in large screen.hd 720p and 1080p videos are mind blowing in terms of picture quality. You can compare it to sony. Excellent quality.fully satisfied 2)sound quality is also very nice.. It has five different modes of sounds preset-movie, music, sports, user and standard. Sound is very loud, no need to connect external speaker, sounds very very clear and very very loud.fully satisfied. 3)you can easily connect 2 pendrives, and also fire tv stick and Google chromecast in hdmi ports works superb, i connected my Xbox with hdmi cable, my gaming experience is superb, i will give 5 out of 5. 4)tv can play and support almost all kinds of video formats and it also has resume support features, you can also play mp3 files, and the user interface of the tv is very good, it also supports subtitles files, you can view pictures using usb and also can read text files.5)build quality of the tv looks premium, bezels are also thin at the bottom a small vu logo is present, i like the design. Now cons are-1)it is a bit difficult to access the hdmi ports when you wall mount the tv. 2)remote of the tv works looks and feels plasticy and cheap in design but works very fine.",

            "It's amazing product.. No words to say.. just like anything which will cost you 40k +..\n\nThe delivery was late by a day but it's ok as the product was delivered safe.\n\nJeeves people are just bad as the technition had stolen my TV wall mount as I was using the table mount. My brother was only there at the time of installation and he didn't noticed that the wall mount was missing. But he noticed that he was something in his pocket which was bulging outside.\n\nThe next day when I reached home I was amazed by the way the tv looked but after checking the box i find out the wall mount was missing. I called the technition and told him that I haven't seen the wall mount and if it was there during the unboxing. I told him that much polite that he can't say that it wasn't there, but he said that in some cases, the wall mount have been reported missing. So I told him that I should email a complaint to flipkart. I cut the call.\n\nHe called me back immediately and said that there is nothing to be complained as VU has given them 30 wall mounts as sometimes it's found missing. I know it was a big lie at the instant he told but I don't tell him anything.\n\nTwo days after he give me the wall mount and on the box it's printed that it's for VU 40D321. What a fool he is. He stoled my wall mount and said a big lie and returned my own product.\n\nAfter all I get it back. It was not a good incident that too from flipkarts authorized service network.\n\nITS TIME TO RETHINK ABOUT JEEVES FLIPKART.",

It is pausing automatically.\n\n3. Sounds is average.\n4. Built-up quality is average.\n5. It's looking like Chinese product.\n6. Service from VU brand:- worse service ever experienced in my life.

The delivery and installation was very quick. Thank you flipkart.\nThere are only to cons in the product:\n1) Sound quality can be improved\n2) The HDMI port are at the back of the TV. So if you want to connect your laptop, you have to tilt the TV and struggle to put the HDMI cable in the slot. To solve this problem, you can buy the HDMI cable upfront and put it in the slot during installation or just remove your setup box HDMI cable and plug it to your laptop, whenever you want to connect the laptop (as both the set-up box and laptop connection are not required together).",

Not only does it not have the stereophonic effects but also lacks clarity when it comes to spoken words and is pretty low even at full volume.\nThe AV and USB ports are at the side but the HDMI and VGA ports situated at the bottom are not easily accessible. Besides, the two hd ports are too close and you cannot have two chords fitted at the same time.\n\nA GOOD BUY at its price, especially for the large screen that you get.",

This is a design issue, which can be resolved. No problem with the harware.\n\nOverall this is a great deal.\n\nNote - Iam using this TV in an average sized living room.

Sony or Samsung brand TV's will cost above 35K. I have been using Sony TV for a decade too. This VU TV cost only Rs. 19499 and I'm lucky I got 10% cashback offer. I bought it for just above 17K.",

Just refer to product description .\nDelivery was before time (within 27 hours of placing order)\nInstallation was done on next day of delivery.\nIn box VU have supplied wall mounting brackets and table stand so no need to bother about all these things.\nComing to features of the TV , picture clarity is wonderful. It supports 1080p videos of all format however it lags on 4k as tv is not a 4k tv.\nSound is a bit low, but it will not create problem as there is option of audio out for home theater.\nAlso there is headfone out port of 3.5 mm .\nOverall this is the TV which can be used in multipurpos, true value for money product.

The picture quality is good especially given the price of 20k INR. When I checked, there were a few not-so-positive reviews about the audio quality but I am very satisfied with the audio as well. Our viewing distance is around 8 feet and it works fine in our space.

But, when I read all the reviews here, I started trusting the company and placed the order as the price was so lucrative.\nUpon receiving, I was just awestruck by the panel quality. The panel quality like the colour reproduction and sharpness was nowhere less than any Samsung or Sony TV available at approx double the price.\nSo, anyone here having the same dilemma as I had, should really pick this TV and save your money.\nFlipkart's delivery was fast and good as usual.\nJeeve's installation guy came next day, the TV was installed. I had opted for 1 + 2 years extended warranty and informed the installation guy about that, to which he responded, that I should save his mobile number and if in case any problem arrises, I can directly contact him as extended warranty is provided by their company only.\nPretty good in my opinion.",

I already had jbl sb350 which I connected to this TV so no issues there for me. The only issue I found was the wall bracket for TV.

I ordered an led tv online with flipkart which had decent offer. The product was supposed to be delivered to me on 8-9th Nov. When I didn't receive the product I filed a complaint by calling flipkart. Then I made call 2 day 2 then call 3 day 3 and so on till call 6. Everytime the discussion was same. No attempt was made from flipkart to contact the delivery partner. And they kept us waiting for the product with no progress. Finally I asked for the delivery partner and got their contact from Google. Upon checkin with them found that the delivery partner doesn't deliver to my place. And this they have communicated to flipcart time and again. Flipkart instead of making at attempt to know the root cause was asking me to cancel the order and loose some more time. The purpose of my review is 1- how do I escalate this issue to higher channel. 2- Any customer ordering some high priced good please be mindful about the unprofessional flipkart delivery service and any issues arising of it. Finally we had to go to warehouse and pick up our product which far away from our home.",
