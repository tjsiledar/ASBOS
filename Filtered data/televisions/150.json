            "Best picture quality , best sound quality, easy use , easy remote use , fast refresh , tv not hanging, fast moving, easy connected all device , google assistant work properly, bluetooth and wifi work properly. This is Best tv in 55 inch. In this price this is best picture and sound quality. 5 star\ud83d\udc4d",
            "Best product in the price range below 50k.\nBought it after a 2 month long survey and not at all disappointed! Sound is awesomely loud and clear vocals. Decent Bass and beats along! The soundbar feel is proper. Picture Quality won't disappoint you. For those who are making negative comments, I advise them to make proper video and audio settings and then re-consider. For my case, the picture setting is DYNAMIC, audio is MUSIC and SHARPNESS settings to ZERO for all apps except Youtube whiere it is set to FIFTEEN. There is an option under Picture settings to improve viewing angles which should be turned ON as the first thing. Motion Enhancement to be set to STANDARD for watching movies. Having a VA Panel with Excellent Blacks, this display is very good if viewing from sides too, with that option ON. Go for it if your Room does not have direct Sunlight all day and if you prefer to watch TV mostly at night!",
            "Wonderful smart TV in the price range. This can compete with the other smart TVs of top brands which costs around 70k+. Sound and picture quality is awesome. Worth the buy.\n\nUpdate after 3 months of usage\nReally wonderful, top quality. Even image and sound both are great. Go for it blind folded in this range one of the best option.",
            "I have been using this product since Jan 2021.\n- It has good sound and picture quality.\n- If you are watching HD, Full HD and 4k Videos then it is a good choice.\n- We can not expect SD videos clarity on any 4k tvs.\n- Andriod version 9 is working fine. No lagging or delay while watching the TV.\n- OTT platform contents are good.

            "Make sure to have atleast HD set top box. SD channels are barely watchable. UHD upscaler doesn't help to upscale SD channels that much. The remote controller is made of ordinary plastics. Spacing of the buttons are poor. More often than not you end up hitting home button while scrolling the down button. Sound is clear & crisp. Bass is just okay. You cannot say it's 103 wattage output. I went for this TV for jbl speakers & it didn't meet my expectations. Unfortunately they are not as good as my 120 wattage boat sooundbar with a subwoofer. I would have gone for 30 wattage hisense A71F instead of this. I shelled out 10k more just for 102 watt jbl sound which is not justified. Both the tv's have almost similar features except for enhanced wattage in tornado. But I regret opting for tornado just for the sound which is not upto mark. I have 43 inch sony bravia 4k tv. I compared the 4k content of both side by side & iam surprised\nby the display of hisense tornado. Watching 4k content is a delight in this one. It's really very good. The triluminus display of sony is tad better than hisense because of their extra colors & hisense tornado is not far behind. There is a huge price difference between the two. Android 9.0 is doing the job very well in hisense. It's blazing fast. I have tested all sort of USB pen drives & 1 TB WD hard disk. It works seamlessly. Much much faster than my sony tv which runs on outdated Android oreo. Jeeves did the job well in the installation department.",
            "I was not sure before buying this TV but after watching and reading multiple reviews i decided to go for it and right now I'm totally satisfied with the picture and sound quality. This one of the best tv in this budget with 105 wat speakers. Just go for it!",
            "The only thing that isn\u2019t great about this TV is its SD to HD upscaling. There is a bit of lag, which may not be noticed if you are watching from a good distance. Otherwise, its the best device one can have at this price.",

Both bluetooth & WiFi connectivity is superb. Upscaling of SD channels is also above mark. Delivery and installation was done on same day for me. Overall good experience.",
            "Considering this a budget TV, it offers a great value for money. Build quality is good and looks are premium.\nNo issue with connectivity or operations after 15 days of usage. Panel quality is good.\n4k UHD picture quality is excellent. I have not used Dish or Cable but HD and SD content on OTT looks good. May need some tuning with Picture modes to best suite your likes.\nAndroid UI is smooth.\n\nSound by JBL. Its very loud no doubt. But you wont find that signature quality of sound you expect from an Audio brand. Its good for general viewing and classical music. Don't expect it to give you extreme soundbar experience. Dolby Digital was disabled out of the box.\n\nHisense called to check for installation and feedback.\n\nOverall pretty good TV experience for the budget.",

            "A brilliant LED that couldn't live upto my expectations in the sound department (maybe I was expecting more because I knew that it comes with a JBL soundbar). Don't get me wrong, the TV produces enough loud and rich sound to have a good experience, but if we talk about real immersive experience, it does leave you desiring more. Let me explain the narrative.\n\nI bought this LED after some extensive research for 2-3 day and I'm thrilled with the final outcome. In the end, I was left with the two options:\n1. Buy this LED with soundbar attached.\n2. Buy Hisense A71F and pair it with a good home theater speaker setup.\n\nSure, there are some differences in both models but are very manageable except soundbar. I went with option 1 but I think I would have been better with option 2. Now sure it would have been 4-7k more expensive but I think it would have been worth it.\n\nAt the end, I don't want to take away anything from this TV as it is a delight to watch 4K content on. I'm not sure on the regular updates but I'm happy with my purchase.",
            "At the time of purchaseing, Flipkart showed a warranty of 4 years. When I purchased the TV, in warranty card it was only for 1 year. Now Flipkart as well as Hisense also not giving us any written documentation about the warranty.\n\nThe sound of TV is not as much as I expected by 102 w speakers. I have to raise the volume up to 85 to feel the theatre effect.",
            "Excellent Display with rich blacks. 5* for it.\n\nSound powered by JBL is not upto to the mark and the in built speakers doesn't support Atmos as checked with Netflix app. 3* for it.\n\nConnectivity is good and without any hassle you can view with wifi. 5* for it.\n\nWhen it comes to value for money, I feel a bit over priced to its own 55 inch series. 4* for it.\n\nHuge problem I faced was installation which took 4 days for them to come do the installation.",
            "ITS A WEEK OF PURCHASE...MY FEEDBACK IS\n\n1. is PICTURE QUALITY GOOD? - YES AND NO, The conversion from HD to 4k is tiring to eyes... 4K content plays well without stutters... But fast moving images creates a difficulty to eyes\n\n2. Sound quality - I dont know.. Sound is clear but i dont get that good sound feel... Its very mild... Iam not impressed since that is the Key selling point of TV,it did not meet expectations.... Better go for normal hisense and good sound bar...i willl. Need a Hisense expert probably to. Come and tune...\n\n3.5Mhz and 2 Mhz - Wifi connectivity is good\n4.Software is seamless so far as i use OTT apps and i dont have DTH\n5.Installtion took 5 days and multiple social media escalations and follow up\n6.The finish of product is premium\n7.They have a pretty good call centre.. Where calls ar attended\n\nOverall... I feel.. Should have gone for normal 4k hisense TV... Ans should have bought a Good sound bar... Probably would have bought their 58inch TV...",

            "Bought the TV during republic day sale.\nTV does not disappoint.\nSW is fast and snappy, eventhough it is Android 9.\nStrangely, some of the apps post installation does not show up, have to check out if it does to incompatibly or age restriction.\nPicture quality is good especially 4k version or even 1080i from stb.\nSound is super awesome.\nHopefully longitivity of TV is good, since it is unknown brand.\nRemote quality could be better, bundling of gamepad if given would be really nice.\nViewing angles being VA panel has its downsides.",
            "I am sharing my experience after the usage of 2 weeks. Firstly Cons:\n\n1. Hisense claiming that it has JBL sound bar. But sound quality is not as expected. But u can enhance by connecting additional sound system.\n\n2. Motion control is not that promising while playing hd and hd ready content. U may feel picture lagging in normal scenes also. It is Ok with 4k content.\n\n3. Pixel bleeding is there around the corners of the TV. however it is visible while watching tv in dark room. During lighting conditions it may not visible.\n\nComing to Pros:\n\n1. Gives premium look and feel. It changed the look of my Hall\n\n2. Os is not lagging at all and smooth too.\n\n3. Picture quality is awesome while watching 4k content. All tv features in terms of picture quality are doing good with 4k content only.\n\n4. Back light brightness is fair int this price segment. No other brand is providing 400 nits of brightness in this segment. It enhances picture quality.\n\n5. There are more customisations are provided to enhance picture quality based on ur requirement.\n\n6. Best value for money.",

They have great customer prompt service.\n\nTV is just great. After using 6 days I can say that it value for money. Picture quality is amazing, sound with JBL will give you great effects. Only if you want to see the picture from more than 130 degree angle than it can be bit low in colours. So not preferable for corners view. Otherwise best TV in this range.",

            "After using 2 + month I must say it's good deal under 40k. Right 55\" under 40K \ud83d\ude43\ud83d\ude43\ud83d\ude43.\nPicture quality, sound and tv overall performance is more then good enough. Model is nice and attractive one.\n\nAs usual all other brands installation part suffer from third party installation. They are always seems to be in hurry. They just comes to unboxing the product not providing demo.\nIt's a must buy product even u have to pay 45-48k for 55'.",
            "A Good product specially if you also use set top box and watch HD channels.Picture quality after upscaling is really good specially set top box point of view.It shines here were as others struggle when you play hd content through set top box on a 4k tv.\nSound is good when compared to other TV's but not as good as advertised for the premium paid here for the sound one can get a sound bar which would give better results and also be more flexible to use.\n\nBut as a single product it's still a good one.Extra warranty during some sales makes it a good reason to neglect the fact that it still runs Android 9.\n\nIn short a decent product.\nHisense 55A71F With a seperate sound bar would be a good option too",

Picture quality is very good...contrast levels are excellant considering it's a VA panel\n3. Installation guy always try to push their own wall mount but there is wall mount in the package...in my case installation was done promptly\n4. I have really enjoyed you tube content, prime, hotstar content because of excellant picture and sound quality\n5. No connectivity issues so far....wifi connection stays solid\n6. Very good value for money considering I got my 55 inch tornado for 44k approx. With the sound bar\n7. SD upscaling is decent\n8. Memc is gud\n\nReally loving this...may it could be just that I had 8 year old 32 inch tv (samsung) before.may be if you are coming of a newer tv to this one ...you may not notice such a difference\nKudos to flipkart for prompt service....",

            "The tv is amazing. Atleast by the look. The wall mount protrudes a little from the wall. I feel this is one of the best buy in this range for the size. The other option would be philips 8125 along with motorola zx pro(ips) . I had not heard about this brand till the time I was researching on TV.\nQuality of the remote and the UI is smooth, picture quality is good. I bought ir since it was offered with a sweet deal of 4 years warranty.\n\nThe installation on the other hand was a tedious task . Only 1 guy came and he was inexperienced.\nIt was a hassle convincing him and getting the wall mount on. I think he was trying to sell the extended wallmount which would cost 1.6k extra.\nI actually dint need so went with in the box wall mount.\n\nNeed to wait for a few months and see how the tv fairs.

            "Pros: TV is the best in its segment in 55 inch TVs with all 4k Video (Dolby Vision, HDR 10, HDR 10+, HLG) and sound formats ( Dolby Digital, Dolby Atoms )supported. Best 4K panel (VA) available for the price.\n\nCons: Only issue with this one is attached sound bar has good sound reproduction but with a little or no bass quality. I will highly recommend to get a good Soundbar or Home Theatre speakers ( If you can afford it ). Can't get the lower model and soundbar since you will lose better speakers and mmc chip (which helps with better blacks and motion and subtitle blooming ). I will recommend Yamaha YAS 209 (The best ) or any Sony 5.1 or 2.1 soundbar if you are on a budget.",
