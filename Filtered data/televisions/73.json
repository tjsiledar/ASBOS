            "EXPECTED MORE BUT NOTHING SPECIAL\n\n*Picture quality is good.\nBut if you want to see the vivid colours please don't buy.\n* Hd and 4k contents are super\n*Picture upscaling is good.

High brightness\n2) Audio is just fine not very great.\n3) Delivery happened soon, that is before time\n4) Packaging etc were fine\n\nCons :-\n1) No much quick control options through remote. for Picture settings, Sound settings etc, we need to go through the menu which is not feasible everytime.\n2) Audio is good, but comes with a Huge down facing sound bar, which occupies a lots of space.\n3) The TV projects almost 15-20 cms from the wall\n4) Surround options are not effective because of sound bar placement.\n5) had to make a couple of followups for installation and as usual Jeeves is not reachable.\n6) However installation happened on the promised date, and the person who came for installation looked very tired.\nHe wanted to finish off the setup soon to move to next customer, may be the company has put a lot of load on them.\n7) Andriod 11 doesnt seem to make much difference.\n8) Have to add the bluetooth option for remote everytime we power on\n9) Could have provided an mobile App, to manage TV, which most TVs has nowadays.\n10) Plastic Build, doesnt seem to be strong.\n\nOverall, not a great option but just does the job.\n\nThanks to useless Flipkart Customer support.",

            "Undoubtedly a very good decision for this purchase. Wonderful, decent look. Picture quality not so good for SD but fabulous for HD and 4K. And the more than paisa wasool for sound. Just wooow...! Crystal clear. Difference of sound delivering from speakers and tweeters are quite remarkable. Dolby ATMOS is absolutely mind blowing. Feeling the every dimension of sound as intended. Wifi connectivity is good.\n\nSome downs..\nStartup delay.\nResponse time of any action is a bit delayed. (Any function you press it on remote will take a pause before it appears on screen)\nSD upscaling in not good or I would say it poor. (But anyways this kind of TVs are not intended to be focused on SD's)\n\nIf you are a Bass lover, there is always an option for additional home theatre or sound bar.\nBut the actual requirement for this TV is only an additional ideal woofer only(without any speakers or sound bar) from brands like Sony or JBL but this kind of customized requirements are not possible.\n\nBut anyways..! Loved it. Go for it.",

            "Ohh thank God and thank you flipkart for the big billion day deal. With the deal I got the 55 inches for 39999\nReview based on the usage after one week. Best in Class.\n\nPros\n\nOn Product\n-----------------\n1. Brightness. Extraordinary brightness with 400 nits\n2. Excellent Audio quality. No need of buying sound bar. Hats off to Nokia for choosing JBL speakers.\n3. Upscaling normal (even SD contents) video contents.\n4. Sleek and smart remote. Can be operable on both IR and Bluetooth.\n\nOn Flipkart:\n-------------------\n1. Great deals\n\u2022 2000 instant deduction for flipkart plus members against 200 coins\n\u2022 3000 SBI card deal\n\u2022 1500 offer on no cost EMI.\n\u2022 Got the excellent bigger screen TV at final price 39499\n2. Excellent delivery on next day as committed.\n3. Perfect on time installation by technician from Jeeves.\n4. Technician has clearly explained about the product features, operation and warrenty\n\nCons :\n1. Bit lagging on audio video synchronization\n2. Could have improved more on the color saturation.\n3. Taking more time on booting after power on.\n4. Android home screen is bit irritating whenever booting. We need to choose the input channel manually every time whenever boots.\n5. Could have provisioned far field mic for voice assistant similar to Mi/xiami and oneplus.\n6. I cant get the sound from tv speakers, if connected external speakers with 3.5mm audio jack unless manually disconnect the audio jack.",
            "Good sound qualify connectivity is good everything is good I liked.",
            "I have been using Nokia 43 inch sound by JBL and Powered by Harman AudioEFX (43UHDADNDT52X) TV for last 9 days.\nPicture quality is Superb, no over saturation of colors. Colors are very natural. Blacks are perfect. no need of any casting devices like firestick. Dolby vision & 4k video's runs effortlessly with great picture quality.\nSound is awesome no need for additional sound bar. Sound is very clear even at low levels. For a room size of 14 /14 Feet you will never require to increase volume more than 45%.\n\nI purchased Nokia Tv after returning VU Premium Ultra HD TV twice. both the times i had issue with night or very dark scenes.\nVU premium Tv was displaying those black scenes as patchy spots. In Nokia TV very dark scenes run flawlessly .\n\nService provided by Flipkart was excellent , they replaced the VU Premium Ultra HD TV initially and when issue still persisted they refunded the money.\nJeeves also provided excellent & timely service on installation. . I even took extended warranty from them. My previous VU 55 inch TV had mother board issue and extended warrant helped me replace it without any cost.",
            "In my view the best UHD LED TV in this price band. Perfectness in terms of sound and display content. No other brand can provide you this sound experience. TV means TV never consider it a subwoofer based music system. I am bass lover and I have other systems for that. I have purchased this 43 inch Nokia tv in addition to 50 inch of same UHD TV within 2 months. You can understand that faith. I am satisfied with both the Nokia TVs.",

            "1. Picture Quality is good for the price point\n2. Sound is amazing , lot of fun if you like to enjoy loud cinematic experience. Prefer to use it on stand than wall mount as the JBL speakers are down firing and give better response while on stand , for wall mount cannot for onkyo version of same which has fron firing speakers.\nOver all a very good experience.",
            "Review of Nokia 50 inch Ultra HD 4K LED Smart TV after using one week. This is a value for money product. Overall experience is very good. Highly recommended and giving review in points to make it easy.\n\n1. Do not compare with premium products ( Sony, Samsung or LG). Understand it is a value for money product.\n\n2. Picture is very good with good brightness and sharp colors. I think best in its price range. Much better than Chinese. Again do not compare with premium products and against rest it is the best .\n\n3. In picture I liked eye protect plus feature. Most features work as claimed and not for namesake. This tv also enhances the picture quality which is also very impressive. Play any low quality video and this tv will enhance its picture quality. Very Nice.\n\n4. Sound by JBL is very impressive. So many people complaining about low sound. I would like to tell them that loud is not good at all. Clear is what matters. Buy any Bose sound system and see how loud it is. It is not loud but clear which is how it should be. Also at this price JBL will provide a basic set up not a higher end setup. Sound is enough and no need to add extra speakers for most. We buy TV for picture, not for its sound. If u get decent sound than it is better which is how it is.\n\n5. Buy it's Qled model if you can spend 10k more. Qled picture is better than this one and this is the only difference between these models.\n\n6. Dual band wifi is a charm. No buffering if you have a decent net speed. Mine is around 50 Mbps. If you connect tv with wired net connection instead of wifi, it will be much better. Recommended for people with low net speed.\n\n7. I could not find much to complain. We need to attach remote with tv by bluetooth every time you start it. This is one major flaw In my view. If you will not add via bluetooth, you need to use the remote directing towards tv. By bluetooth it will work in all directions inside the range. Not a deal breaker at all.\n\n8. A little bit lag but nothing major.\n\n9. Google Assistant work smoothly but again will depend on your net speed.\n\n10. One feature I loved is you can activate auto sound adjustment. Once you activate it, tv will automatically adjust sound on all channels. No need to adjust sound again if you change the channel or if any ad. Comes in between.\n\n11. Design is vey good and it looks premium.\n\nThanks for reading a long review. I hope my review will help you guys in selecting your tv.",
            "Awesomeness to the price range, best in class segment and JBL system just nailed it the sound performance\n\nLoving visual and artistic sound quality\n\nGreat deal on festive shopping\n\nThanks Nokia n Flipkart",
            "Pic quality super\nSound is nice",
            "Value for money.\n\nThis is about 50 inch UHD TV.\nPicture quality is very good considering the budget. One must choose the right picture settings for excellent results . For this TV dynamic picture mode is too good, you can adjust as per your interest.\nSound is excellent , the proper seating of equaliser is important with movie mode of sound.\n\nOverall value for money product",
            "I m writing this review after 12 days of use.\nTV is awesome picture quality is insane sound is also good i dnt knw how does 20watt speaker's sound is & 60 watt's sound But sound is good and we dnt purchase TV for sound quality we can upgrade as we need it to good soundbar too.\nIf u are just looking at the brand name if u are thinking that nokia is new in TV sector then leave it because they are doing best just close ur eyes & go for it.",
            "1) Best android TV i can say\n2) Worth buying it\n3) Can enjoy alot while watching it\n4) Don't think before ordering it, jus go for it!\n5) NOKIA 1st launched a phone it worked very well and now launched a TV I'm sure it will sound very good in market so all the best NOKIA team",
            "Pros:\n1) Stock/Pure Android OS - Very much a delight for stock android lovers.\n2) Strong build - Plastic body and Aluminium Tabketop stand.\n3) TV comes with a free simple wall mountable stand and a very short RCA cable\n4) Very prompt and quick \"next day\" TV installation. Jeeves's takes care of the Authorized service support for Nokia(along with many others). They seem to know what they are doing.\n5) Vibrant display - compared with Samsung/OnePlus, Motorola, Mi abd VU TV, this is a very good option. Dolby vision available.\n6) Great and crystal clear Audio - You've downfiring Harmon speakers - Wofer as well as Tweeter set and JBL Sound along with Dolby Atmos!\n7) Data saver is automatic - No seperate option available.\n8) A simple remote(be careful it costs 2.5K it lost) with 4 hot keys.\n9) Very quick casting from Laptop, Mobile or Tablet.\n\n\nCons:\n1) You gotta take the complete protection plan from Jeeves if you want to ensure/insure the TV. This is a Pro, but for a first tim buyer, it seems costly - alost 4000/-, but very much worth it. Everyone knows - Smart TVs dont literally last the same as non-Smart TV. So blindly take this full protection plan from Jeeves(who is the ASP for Nokia).\n2) The startup is slow - takes about a minute or two - well your nokia TV is just a big gigantic android phone - so this is fine ;)",
            "After using for around a month i would say \"sound is the best you can get in this price range. Picture quality could be improved but not bad with the price segment. Have good handy features like only sound mode, using the tv as a Bluetooth speaker are some of the really good features, games like Beach buggy racing, real racing works just fine. Controller connectivity is awesome, not enough points to complain about\"\n\nLastly one thing i would like to say if you are planning to wall mount, then the one with Onkyo soundbar will be better as it has front firing speakers and can give you dolby atmos feel. If you are planning to keep it on stand, then go for the JBL one.\n\nHappy shopping \ud83d\udecd \u263a\ufe0f",
