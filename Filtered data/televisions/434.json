            "Read the features on web site and decided to buy this 55\" model of JVC.\nFound much more than my expectation.\n1) State of art product. Bazel less and edge to edge picture.\n2) 50 Watts Sound output is Superb.\n3) Picture quality is Superb. UHD.\n4) It has Quantum Lit Panel which gives true & Rich Colours of picture.\n5) The best part is that it has 2gb Ram and 16 GB Rom. Hence no buffering and lot of space for downloading further apps. No Hanging at all.\n6) More than 500 pre loaded apps - so no need to download any app. you name the app and it is there.\n7) Aesthetic wise - Superb. Champaign Gold colour of Sound bar gives a rich look to the product.\n8) A Japanese brand with such feature packed product at this price is unbelievable.\n9) The Service team came for installation just after delivery.\nQuick Service response.\nI would call it a best Buy",
            "Such a fantastic product. O edges, looks so sleek... so many apps, motion sensor remote, and colour and picture is tooo good.... thank you FLipkart. Thank you JVC, great product. Very satisfied, highly recommended.",
            "Pros: 1) Looks premium, better than any other TV in the market. 2) Excellent picture quality: whether the content is 4k, HD or SD. It looks awesome. Blacks are true blacks, colors look natural. HDR10+ really works and gives good detail. 3) Sound: Extremely good. Loud and clear sound bar with four speakers and 2 tweeters. Activating surround sound fills the room. 4) App store: JVC as well as Android app store. Gives you access to all the apps that you may need 5) Sensy TV to control your set top box from TV remote or mobile phone. Cons: PS4 pro uses HDR whereas this TV has HDR10+ which is better than HDR. But not recognised by Sony, hence your PS4 will not recognize this TV as HDR capable. 2) No settings option to switch HDR10+ to HDR. 3) Only 2 USB ports, you will have to use one for provided blue tooth remote and other for Sensy cable. You will need to remove one of these to put the hard disk (I bought a 4 port USB hub to resolve the issue. It works well) 4) It is not official Android. 5) No voice support on remote control. 6) Smart remote pointer doesn't work reliably. instead I use eshare app on my mobile which works like a charm. 7) JVC dues not provide software updates. 8) Due to old version of Android, Netflix and YouTube apps doesn't come in 4K. 9 Latest update 24 Dep 19 YouTube doesn't work anymore. on launching it says new version available, no option to skip the message. When I go to play store to download the new version, it says your device is not supported.",
            "( bird's-eye view review)\n\nJVC JAPAN (LT-55N7105C) is a very good option with very nice bezel-less design on its corners. It has UHD 4k resolution (even if when I test on Youtube, 4k type videos are seen as 1080 HD on last resolution on the App, but it plays 4k videos in external hard disk or pendrive). Viewing angles are very amazing (180\u00b0) & display is very crisp & bright. I don't have any problem regarding viewing it.\n\nIt runs on Android 5.1 fully customized app like your phone no limitation to install apps on google play as other Android TV, as well as you can install on JVC App store (the problem is most of a time the phone apps may fail on TV because those apps are designed for phones,\u2026 till this TV is not Google certified) and it has \"Linux\" based patchwall operating system which is very fluid & very easy to use. NETFLIX, amazon prime, Hotstar, EROSNOW, YOUTUBE are some of pre-installed on this TV, too many options are there to connect tis TV to your mobile phone as well as your PC.\n\nIt comes with very handy & nice features which are useful and easy to use. Its remotes are very unique both main and the Air Mouse with keyboard and have third party SENSY (Smart TV with Patchwall Launcher with sensy STB controller.)\n\nIn the front, It has 4 DTE sound bars inside with 2 twitters (25w+25) =50W which are loud enough (NO NEED HOME SOUND SYSTEM)\n\nThis Smart TV comes with 3 HDMI, 1 SD Card Reader (even SD card reader is not mentioned by the supplier and Flipkart) 2 USB, (connectivity =RF, AV IN, HDMI, USB, SD card, COAXIL, LAN (RJ45) Audio out) and the wall mount is good Quality. Aluminum TV stand is very good. Finally, the delivery service is very professional plus TV package is very good even the screen is laminating to avoid scratches in transportation time.",
            "Jvc Japan is best\nThis tv is one of the best tvs I have purchased. It has FrAmeless design , and very sleek. It is metallic feel totally Japanese Finish. Sound quality is very loud and clear. Tv has unlimited apps inside due to netrange portal. Also picture quality is soothing to eyes.\nJapanese product\nJapanese trust and Japanese brand is best.",
            "the tv is good but the software does not support netflix youtube it keeps asking for update and when i update it say your device isnt compatible with this version, so far the old version of YouTube was working but since 2/3 days its not even working.",
            "JVC Japan is Japan company,so TV look & feel is very high quality & like Japanese product.\nAs promised,installation was very fast.\nTV has 2 remotes-1 normal remote with direct to apps key buttons,1 querty keypad & wify remote.Both are very nice & work seamlessly.\nThe best part is- it is edge to edge frameless TV, I have never seen like this. Very -very nice looking.\nOne more good thing is it has great JVC speakers with JVC Japan sound quality, it is wow.\nAs promised, apps are unlimited in the TV.\nVery easy to use & good quality product.\nI Recommend, 1 must go for JVC Japan.",
            "JVC 55\" UHD 4K is quite a treat to watch.\nIt makes the living room a live theatre with its size, sound quality, visual effects, black & golden look and latest features. It will change the home theatre concept forever and soon will be recognized as smart TV with home theatre. The installation was also very quick and without any hassle. Staff was extremely cooperative and friendly. I would definitely recommend everybody for JVC 55 inch ultra HD 4K as it provide a very unique experience at affordable price.",
            "Excellent looks, perfect sound even without home theatre, lots of media is available to enjoy, easy and fast accessibility of features with smart remote, nice product on a very attractive price, good experience, seems I am direct in touch with the whole world, CHA GAYE JVC.......",
            "it's an awesome product in this price segment, truly magnificent work. it doesn't play 4k videos through youtube, but you can play them through usb/hard drive. Bluetooth mouse may not work properly when go far from tv as the bluetooth connected at the back of tv. if you get usb extension then it works absolutely fine. People mentioned support is worst from Jvc, i didn't get any issues yet so need to check that case. when it comes to TV, go for it blindly.",

I don't have any problem regarding viewing it.\n\nIt runs on Android 5.1 fully customized app like your phone no limitation to install apps on google play as other Android TV, as well as you can install on JVC App store (the problem is most of a time the phone apps may fail on TV because those apps are designed for phones,\u2026 till this TV is not Google certified) and it has \"Linux\" based patchwall operating system which is very fluid & very easy to use. NETFLIX, amazon prime, Hotstar, EROSNOW, YOUTUBE are some of pre-installed on this TV, too many options are there to connect tis TV to your mobile phone as well as your PC.\n\nIt comes with very handy & nice features which are useful and easy to use. Its remotes are very unique both main and the Air Mouse with keyboard and have third party SENSY (Smart TV with Patchwall Launcher with sensy STB controller.)\n\nIn the front, It has 4 DTE sound bars inside with 2 twitters (25w+25) =50W which are loud enough (NO NEED HOME SOUND SYSTEM)\n\nThis Smart TV comes with 3 HDMI, 1 SD Card Reader (even SD card reader is not mentioned by the supplier and Flipkart) 2 USB, (connectivity =RF, AV IN, HDMI, USB, SD card, COAXIL, LAN (RJ45) Audio out) and the wall mount is good Quality. Aluminum TV stand is very good. Finally, the delivery service is very professional plus TV package is very good even the screen is laminating to avoid scratches in transportation time.",
            "Jvc Japan is best\nThis tv is one of the best tvs I have purchased. It has FrAmeless design , and very sleek. It is metallic feel totally Japanese Finish. Sound quality is very loud and clear. Tv has unlimited apps inside due to netrange portal. Also picture quality is soothing to eyes.\nJapanese product\nJapanese trust and Japanese brand is best.",
            "the tv is good but the software does not support netflix youtube it keeps asking for update and when i update it say your device isnt compatible with this version, so far the old version of YouTube was working but since 2/3 days its not even working.",
            "JVC Japan is Japan company,so TV look & feel is very high quality & like Japanese product.\nAs promised,installation was very fast.\nTV has 2 remotes-1 normal remote with direct to apps key buttons,1 querty keypad & wify remote.Both are very nice & work seamlessly.\nThe best part is- it is edge to edge frameless TV, I have never seen like this. Very -very nice looking.\nOne more good thing is it has great JVC speakers with JVC Japan sound quality, it is wow.\nAs promised, apps are unlimited in the TV.\nVery easy to use & good quality product.\nI Recommend, 1 must go for JVC Japan.",
            "JVC 55\" UHD 4K is quite a treat to watch.\nIt makes the living room a live theatre with its size, sound quality, visual effects, black & golden look and latest features. It will change the home theatre concept forever and soon will be recognized as smart TV with home theatre. The installation was also very quick and without any hassle. Staff was extremely cooperative and friendly. I would definitely recommend everybody for JVC 55 inch ultra HD 4K as it provide a very unique experience at affordable price.",
            "Excellent looks, perfect sound even without home theatre, lots of media is available to enjoy, easy and fast accessibility of features with smart remote, nice product on a very attractive price, good experience, seems I am direct in touch with the whole world, CHA GAYE JVC.......",
            "it's an awesome product in this price segment, truly magnificent work. it doesn't play 4k videos through youtube, but you can play them through usb/hard drive. Bluetooth mouse may not work properly when go far from tv as the bluetooth connected at the back of tv. if you get usb extension then it works absolutely fine. People mentioned support is worst from Jvc, i didn't get any issues yet so need to check that case. when it comes to TV, go for it blindly.",
            "Pros: Japanese Brand. Good Product. Good Display, Sound quality is also very good. Value for money. Most of the things are as promised. Quick delivery and installation by FlipKart. Very good viewing angles, can see from any angle. Blacks are handled nicely. Feels nice to see HD movies on big screen with quality sound. Flipkart is offering additional 6 months free warranty to select customers I guess.\n\nCons: Main desperation, You Tube 4K videos do not show up. Can't upgrade You Tube app. No YouTube casting possible. My old Sony TV YouTube had that option. Could directly cast running YouTube video from Phone or Laptop to the TV. So not so truly smart. Doesn't support Dolby output by TATA Sky HD set top box. Air mouse tough to handle. EShare app covers for it and gives good alternative interface.\n\nOverall very good TV compared to the options available in same price range with similar features. Happy to have this product.",

It may be upgraded to Oreo please.\n2. Voice remote is not available. Please replace the existing remote with Voice remote for searching easily.\n3. Sensy cable is not working with most of the Setup Boxes which were supplied by the Cable Operators.\n4. Warranty extension is not available.\n5. Prime videos are not up to the mark comparing with Fire TV Stick. It may be upgraded please.\n6. Bluetooth is not available.\n\nIt is highly recommended TV to purchase everyone. Except the above, TV performance is very nice. Especially, Display is outstanding and Sound is crystal clear with bass effect. Thank u Flipkart.",

            "Pros :\n1. You've bought one of the best TV's in this price range.\n2. Picture and Audio quality meets more than your requirement.\n3. Bezel less design looks fantastic.\n4. No lagging while switching between apps.\n5. Wifi connectivity has no problem at all.\n6. Motion sensor works really well.\n7. Screen mirroring and E-sharing features work fantastically.\n\nCons :\n1. YouTube and Netflix doesn't work. Since there is no update for the OS, the old version doesn't support and it is not able to install the latest version by any means I've tried. I've been using other 3rd party apps to stream videos on YouTube. If you're a Netflix user, kindly take this into account.\n2. Bluetooth's absence is prominent.\n3. Updates never come.\n4. The OS is Android-based and not true android.\n\nIf you're going to buy a TV in this price range, go for it. If money isn't a big deal, then I'd like to prefer Mi or the newly emerged Nokia TV or OnePlus TV.",

Without this there is no meaning it is a smart tv. Then yours choice.",

Tried to contact JVC India for firmware update but they refused to handle any TV product. No update of firmware available anywhere on the internet. Probably a second rate manufacturer from Delhi has acquired the license to assemble in India. The brand is not mentioned in Flipkart exchange (You need to select 'Others'). I sacrificed a beautiful Panasonic 50 inch plasma TV for it as exchange and regret the decision. Picture and sound adjustment do nothing. Even if one reduces the backlight to Zero, screen still stays garish bright. If you try to reduce brightness/contrast, the picture vanishes into a dark, imperceptible screen. And, a very clumsy engineer came to install, whom I had to guide as he lost his wits.",

Flipkart is dilly dallying with the return/refund process.\n\nSpeakers - barely better than standard TV speakers. No bass, poor mids and harsh treble.\n\nDisplay - good contrast and colors, but not HDR as advertised.\n\n\nUI - Awful. Runs on android 5, incompatible with most modern apps. Netflix and prime are using mobile app versions and are not really fit for the big screen. I should also mention that the UI is quite laggy.\n\nIf you've got a 4k firestick and don't have a need for HDR, this is not a bad TV, but be wary of its flaws and don't buy it for its speakers because you'll be disappointed.",
