            "I purchased Kodak CAPro 43 inch Android TV from Flipkart. After receiving the product i watched two 4k HDR movies and found the screen quality and Sound quality is excellent .The HDR brightness of 450Nits is absolutely awesome for watching horror movies. the product quality is excellent. Iam totally satisfied with the product. the only downside is the wall mount: The wall mount provided along with the TV is good but very thin metallic frame, but after installation i found that it is equally good for holding TV with wall. As of now no complains. I would strongly recommend it for buyer.",
            "I was quite hesitate while purchasing. However gave a it a shot and got this budget king TV.\nThe manufacture date is October 2021 , its a new tv on the market.\nThe TV was delivered 3 days. The picture and sound quality is great for this price. Soon as I turned on the tv I got a update which was nice to see. Android 10 is the version currently in this TV.\nThe wall mount provided looks small but does its job.\nGo for it \ud83d\udc4d\u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\udf89",
