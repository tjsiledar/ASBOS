Only the brightness is a little low and single band wifi, rest it's an amazing TV. If you use a firestick, it's the best you can get at this price below 30k for 50 inch. If you don't have the TV running 24x7 and get little time at home then this is your pick.",

Brought on sale for 26K. Worth risking because of the price. Picture quality is OK for the price. Sound is good. Connectivity and app support are excellent. If you are ok to spend 10K to 15K for the delta in quality, go for better brands.",

Several calls to Iffalcon customer service did not result in a technician visit to evaluate and fix it. They even canceled my service request twice stating they could not reach my number - that was false.Finally contacted Flipkart regarding return and they did initiate the return. But due to the Covid restrictions, the uninstall and return of the defective unit also got delayed. Finally received the replacement unit in early June. After two days use, the new one appears to be OK.

Did not test it with other 4k tv but in comparison to my other FHD 50 Inch tv picture quality is decent enough\n3. Audio quality is decent for my room and I don't feel like adding an additional sound bar. You might need one if you want it for home\ntheatre purpose but for regular usage the attached speakers do the work.\n3. I got the television delivered just on the other day of making thr payment but the installation happened 2 days later than the date given to me by Flipkart still I'll not complaint much about it as the installation was quick and smooth.\n\nP.S - you'll have to pay 500/- extra to the installation team for wall mount.\nCons -\n\n1. The application do hang. Especially with prime video I find it difficult to navigate, especially during initation\n2. Remote is excessively long. I don't think we need these keypad numbers here. Also the quality of buttons do feel cheap.\n\nOverall I think it's a good tv at this price point",

            "Writing this review after using the TV for a week! The iFFALCON 50inch UHD 4K Smart TV 50K61 is an absolute winner. For the price, this is by far one of the best televisions you could buy especially if you are someone who loves good displays. Let me break this down:\n\nDisplay: 4K with scale up and dynamic dimming and HDR10 support. Now I was not sure how this was going to work, but once I switched it on and plugged in my PS4 into the ARC HDMI port, I was treated to an experience that I did not get from my previous 4K tv. HDR10 is truly something that you\u2019ll have to see to believe. And this display does not disappoint. Yes the brightness could have been a little bit more in terms of total NITS, but for a bedroom setup that\u2019s dark and cosy, this screen is absolutely brilliant!\n\nBuilt in Apps: Again, with Android pie out of the box the app support is excellent! And the best part- you get to watch HDR10 content right off the bat with Netflix and other supporting OTT services. The connections are seamless and the WiFi links are solid. I\u2019ve not had an issue with buffering at all over this past week of watching this TV.\n\nSound: The down firing speakers are good! Maybe not super brilliant or something but they sound really good. However, I use a 5.1 surround system in the room and the sounds are amazing from this TV. The internal processing for audio is excellent.\n\nDelivery and Installation: Now this is where I\u2019ll give full marks! The TV was delivered the next day of ordering and installation happened the same day as delivery! Rithik, the service engineer was very nice! Very polite, very handy with the whole process of installation and demo. It barely took him 20 mins to finish the job and I got my TV wall mounted! So exceptional service by the installation and delivery teams. Thank you Flipkart and TCL for this!\n\nOverall: From a budget perspective, this is by far the best 4K smart tv you could get your hands on. The remote which connects by Bluetooth is seamless and does not loose its connection. The tv processor is quick with sufficient RAM to carry out the actions you request. And the overall viewing experience is fantastic!\n\nI recommend this TV for anyone looking to upgrade to a large screen size without feeling the dent on their wallet! Go for iFFALCON 50K61!",
