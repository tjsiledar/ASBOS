I said i have not bought separately it must be with tv. After that he said he has the stand and it will cost you for Rs 500. When i said it seems not more than 250-300 then he said i will charge for 400. Such kind of things these people are doing which has down my interest and moral to buy these things online.",

Even at volume level of 50-60 the sound from tv is not as expected. App connectivity was also an issue for me at the beginning, however with software update guided by customer service team the problem got resolved to some extent. Recommended for someone who is looking for a big screen TV in low budget, however it surely doesn't meet the standards of old brands like Sony, Samsung or LG",

            "I'm LG TV user from last 10 years which is still going great but that was worth 70k! This time had such a cheap option so decided to give a try. Honestly built quality is not that strong or sturdy as big brands but it's optimised for better value for money! I got VA panel unit unfortunately but can't expect IPS for this price. Sound quality is great if you know how to tune EQ. There is no bass from speakers and one should not expect also. Now coming to the brightness I have no complaints so far if you keep daylight dimming off. Saturation and all others settings are good on standard settings. The worst part is Installation and Demo. The Jeeves technician knew the guideline so as per guideline he just called me 3 times and kept himself on mute then called alternate number once and kept himself on mute again. So his guideline was followed and he straight away went home! When I called him back he explained me this guideline and went in argument I felt like he was drunk. I had to open the TV and install it myself. But installation & demo was horrible experience till the date I have got for any product! I'll recommend to install stands yourself as that's matter of minutes. If you want wall mounted setup then installer is recommended.\nUpdate - After 3 days same installer called me and this time he came. As TV was already installed by me he was super happy. He just took OTP and flew away! He also aaksed me to get extended warranty for 2k which I denied. I'll prefer buying stabilizer of 2k! Disappointment came back in picture as he didn't even gave stamp on warranty card as he said only invoice is enough you won't need warranty card for warranty claims! Why I wasted my time I don't understand! Anyways I'll recommend flipkart to skip installation and Demo and give customer straight away discount instead. Customers know how to fix 4 screws no need to wait for installer for that silly matter!",

I love the excellent picture quality and am overwhelmed by the vivid picture displayed. The sound quality is low on Bass but it overall it produces very melodious sound. I would anyway need a soundbar for this.\nThe only drawback is the sound lag while casting. I'm looking to sort this out somehow, but I seriously think MI should pay heed to this.\nI've viewed many Smart TVs but this one gives and excellent viewing experience due to the extra thin bezels.

But there is lot of issues about connectivity of Miracast which is very annoying.\nI am using my tv around 1 month sharing mobile Hotspot and I don't face any problems.\n\nNow I want to share what is the greatest disaster for me about this tv. Basically I wanted to bought this tv to access Indian stock market related apps. My nearest MI centers and everywhere, it was mentioned that Google playstore is available in this tv, so you can access any apps whatever you want,this is just like your mobile google play store .....\nBut the reality is only video based apps like \"Ted X, voot, hotstar, Netflix etc\" are available in Google play store.\nMI store and flipkart should have provided this important information with clarity.\n\nI hope my detailed review will help other customers.",
