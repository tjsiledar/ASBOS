            "This is my first Smart TV and probably first detailed review ever.\n\nI bought this TV after a long research and hesitations. I was worried about my TV experience in low budget and I cannot afford LG, SONY and SAMSUNG high end TVs. Low Budget segments from these makes are not upto the mark as per my research. So competition was between either Mi or Vu. Don't compare this TV with QLEDs and OLEDs. They are high quality brand Tvs which require deep pockets too. I, Like many other thought Vu is Chinese brand but I found out an Indian Lady (Devita Saraf) is founder and CEO. I am sure many parts may have been produced in China or elsewhere but still company is Indian and thankfully the TV quality is also very good. I compared it with Mi TV 4 on many reviews and found out that its nose ahead with it.\n\nPROS:\n\n1) DISPLAY : I thought VA panel may not be as good as IPS but display is very good. Much better than Mi TVs which I have seen personally in many locations. Colors are bright, sharp and vivid. Plus it has VOD Upscaler that means SD channels are looking a bit better then other TVs.\n2) ANDROID: System is running smoothly with Android Pie which many told its not the case but in this TV I found out its very good.\n3) BUILD-QUALITY: This is my first big smart TV so I haven't seen other very closely but build quality looks good.\n4) REMOTE: Remote works really fine.\n5) COST: BEST part is the cost. No other TV will give me these much feature and quality at this cost.\n\nCONS:\n1) AUDIO: I wont say its bad but its average audio output. Thinking of attaching it with my speakers.\n2) SOAP OPERA EFFECT: Most apps doesn't have it but I found out JIO Cinema is showing movies in Soap Opera Effects. I am not able to find how to switch off the effects. May be its in App. Don't know.\n\nAll in all I am very happy with the purchase as for people like me its a big decision. I thank you Devita Saraf.",
            "Update 1 : Few days of Usage.\n\n1. Value for money. Hits above it's price bracket.\n2. Fast (2GB Ram), have good internal memory at 16GB.\n3. Happy with the sound quality, it gets loud if you have right audio settings. ( Refer Tech Singh YouTube video)\n4. Tv display is bit flimsy while holding the tv for mounting, but it may be because it is large at 55 Inch.\n5. I sit 8 feet away from my tv and it feels large, like a theatre in here, not sure if that is a good thing for eyes, let's wait and see.\n\nMore updates will come as I use it more.",
            "Great value for money.\nPros-\n4k display is good, pictures look stunning.\n\nSlim bezels and overall premium appearance.\n\nAndroid tv features are all cool.\n\n30 watt sound was better than anticipated. Sound bar wasn't necessary.\n\nBluetooth+IR remote is really good.\n\nHeadphone jack and Bluetooth functionality is nice.\n\nLot of picture settings to tweak with to get perfect picture quality that suits individual preference.\n\nGoogle assistant works great.\n\nCons-\nWhile VA panel is supposed to produce better blacks than ips, i didn't really notice good black levels.\n\nViewing from an angle wasn't as good(i guess, not sure).\n\nSome wierd light bleeding-like effects and some dark patches on edges of display especially noticable on YouTube app intro icon/animation. Only visible on frames with low brightness. (Most people wouldn't notice or care).\n\nNitpicks-\nBluetooth headphone connectivity is gimmicky. Audio only works on hdmi inputs and apps. Doesn't work on usb input, which is frustrating.(edit:- Disconnecting the AUX audio out cable solved the issue with bluetooth audio errors. but there is some audio latency for hdmi input sources while playing through bluetooth.)\n\nConnecting to Bluetooth headset while headphone jack is bieng used by sound bar is really hard. Options for switching audio to Bluetooth headset-only from audio jack is buried deep inside audio settings menu.(edit:- here also disconnecting audio AUX cable solved the issue)\n\nStarting time of tv is a bit high. Around 1 minute. Doesn't automatically play live tv/set-up box input after turning on the tv. You have to select input source each time you turn on the tv. Default input is Android home screen. old people wouldn't be able to watch on their own\n\nAndroid home screen interface is not always smooth.\n\n8k videos are not at all playable. Video just freezes. Tv cannot handle 8k resolution like some qhd smartphones do.\n\nDidn't notice any 4k upscaling of HD channels or SD channels.",
            "Great product at the price....\nOperating is simple and remote is Bluetooth connected (no IR Sensor) which I liked it very much. Google assistant voice commands make it easy for operating. Bluetooth earphones can be connected. Inbuilt chrome cast & Phone mirroring works like charm. Picture quality is great.\nSpeakers : it is more than enough for 30 feet Hall.\nDefinitely worth every rupee...\nReview based on one week usage.",
            "So got delivered just in 2 days. Awesome picture quality. 4k videos lagging for sometime. 2gb ram seems quite good. But design is super cool. Built quality is superior . In the end value for money . Go for it. WiFi connectivity is really fast. Lest wait for a week. I will update .",
            "After using 10 days , I am writing a review for this television.\n\nPros :\n1. Picture quality is best ,you can't get this quality at this price in any other brand.\n2. Performance is great. Tv responds quite fast, no lag so far.\n3. Sound is amazing, only 25% volume is enough to listen. True surround X feature works great.\n4. Features such as picture setting and sound setting works fine too.\n5. Prime, Netflix, hotstar n all apps are working fine. Just Jio Tv doesn't work( Need mouse for toggling)\n6. Android ver. Supports sideloads apps too.\n7. Casting smoothly works everytime.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Predefined Picture modes aren't good in picture settings.For eg. No mode for \"eye protect\"\n2.Fast motion in video gives you a headache , it's should've been more still. You can't read television running promoter.\n\n\nAfter usage of 2 months, voice command button stopped working on Remote and they said remote is not covered in warranty.",
            "I bought this TV for PS 4 Gaming which i thought. Would provide me a great gaming experiance as expected the TV picture quality is great and sound clarity is also great. Good TV for less Budget. Awesum from VU",
            "Excellent TV. I am writing this review to help others for the correct choice..It has awesome picture quality and sound. Internet connectivity is good. Non HD channels quality also good.",
            "Really after a long time I brought a Vu TV this is my first TV I never seen such a TV like this, picture quality amazing, sound, full screen display is very good advantage, connectivity super fast we should install google home for that, most probably I like this TV.. Wait for more ten days for my more reviews..",
            "After 2 weeks usage.\n1. Awesome picture quality.\n2. Sound is loud,but little bit clarity is missing(Ok).\n3. Built-in chromecast is working Fine\n4. Checked OTT Apps -prime,netflix,hotstar,Ahaa. All are working Fine.\n5.Best budget TV with best features in this price segment.\n6. Value for money",

Doesn't work on usb input, which is frustrating.(edit:- Disconnecting the AUX audio out cable solved the issue with bluetooth audio errors. but there is some audio latency for hdmi input sources while playing through bluetooth.)\n\nConnecting to Bluetooth headset while headphone jack is bieng used by sound bar is really hard. Options for switching audio to Bluetooth headset-only from audio jack is buried deep inside audio settings menu.(edit:- here also disconnecting audio AUX cable solved the issue)\n\nStarting time of tv is a bit high. Around 1 minute. Doesn't automatically play live tv/set-up box input after turning on the tv. You have to select input source each time you turn on the tv. Default input is Android home screen. old people wouldn't be able to watch on their own\n\nAndroid home screen interface is not always smooth.\n\n8k videos are not at all playable. Video just freezes. Tv cannot handle 8k resolution like some qhd smartphones do.\n\nDidn't notice any 4k upscaling of HD channels or SD channels.",
            "Great product at the price....\nOperating is simple and remote is Bluetooth connected (no IR Sensor) which I liked it very much. Google assistant voice commands make it easy for operating. Bluetooth earphones can be connected. Inbuilt chrome cast & Phone mirroring works like charm. Picture quality is great.\nSpeakers : it is more than enough for 30 feet Hall.\nDefinitely worth every rupee...\nReview based on one week usage.",
            "So got delivered just in 2 days. Awesome picture quality. 4k videos lagging for sometime. 2gb ram seems quite good. But design is super cool. Built quality is superior . In the end value for money . Go for it. WiFi connectivity is really fast. Lest wait for a week. I will update .",
            "After using 10 days , I am writing a review for this television.\n\nPros :\n1. Picture quality is best ,you can't get this quality at this price in any other brand.\n2. Performance is great. Tv responds quite fast, no lag so far.\n3. Sound is amazing, only 25% volume is enough to listen. True surround X feature works great.\n4. Features such as picture setting and sound setting works fine too.\n5. Prime, Netflix, hotstar n all apps are working fine. Just Jio Tv doesn't work( Need mouse for toggling)\n6. Android ver. Supports sideloads apps too.\n7. Casting smoothly works everytime.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Predefined Picture modes aren't good in picture settings.For eg. No mode for \"eye protect\"\n2.Fast motion in video gives you a headache , it's should've been more still. You can't read television running promoter.\n\n\nAfter usage of 2 months, voice command button stopped working on Remote and they said remote is not covered in warranty.",
            "I bought this TV for PS 4 Gaming which i thought. Would provide me a great gaming experiance as expected the TV picture quality is great and sound clarity is also great. Good TV for less Budget. Awesum from VU",

            "Really after a long time I brought a Vu TV this is my first TV I never seen such a TV like this, picture quality amazing, sound, full screen display is very good advantage, connectivity super fast we should install google home for that, most probably I like this TV.. Wait for more ten days for my more reviews..",
            "After 2 weeks usage.\n1. Awesome picture quality.\n2. Sound is loud,but little bit clarity is missing(Ok).\n3. Built-in chromecast is working Fine\n4. Checked OTT Apps -prime,netflix,hotstar,Ahaa. All are working Fine.\n5.Best budget TV with best features in this price segment.\n6. Value for money",
            "I have been using SONY full HD for the past 4 years... Planned to go with Sony again but this product changed my mind to choose this because of the specs... It does what are the things that have told in the specs sheet.. Being a #Rahmaniac (#thalaivARR) fan sound quality is damn good.. Clear voices and great highs and lows.. Mind blowing one... What a great TV to upgrade...\nVU u r simply Awesome... Thanks for the great product..",
            "It looks truly premium with the silver bezel less design. The sound quality is really impressive. The interface is quite smooth but it does takes around 5-7 seconds to boot up once you switch on the tv. Android is neatly optimized and screen sharing works perfectly too. The best feature has to be Google Assistant and they have given a dedicated button for it on the remote. It easily detects and responds to our voice. The videos are rich, dynamic and clear. Although, the refresh rate is just 50 hz which is too low for a 4k panel but it serves the basic purpose if clarity is concerned. Its surely a value for money product. It was delivered and installed on the same day with no complaints. Perfect tv for its price!",
            "This is second tv for family. Flipkart delivery was on date and time..even installation n demo was same day within 2 hours at my place that i didn't expected. Tv is soo awesome and feels much premium.. viewing angles r superb on 175 degree..after that it little fade. but who watch tv on 180 degree?....HD & SD channels r running smoothly n SD channels view is also good. bazzels r soo thin..4k content runs superb without lag..sound is very very superb. 30w is very enough for tv. remote need alphanumeric physical buttons so that we can easily change channels by tv remote not by set up box remote. all ports r working and gives their output properly. Value for money.\nThanks.",
            "Not worth buying if you just heard good reviews about it from many people.\nIf you have a decent budget obviously go for good brands like Sony or Samsung or LG.\nOnly in the case u lack in budget but want the namesake extra features, then happily go for this one.\n\nThe quality is no where close to any other brands in terms or either screen display, sound or even frame rate. Everything just seems so lower in quality than the known brands.\n\nSo if u need a TV with good quality display, sound, etc don't think of this one.\nConsider only if u are bound by budget and can adjust with close to average performance or below!\n\nIn short, I'm not so happy with it! Wish I could just send it back.",
            "Writing this review after 2 months of usage. The Best option out there if you are looking for a budget Smart TV. I have Used MI TV also so I can compare both of them.\nIn each and every aspect, The Vu Premium TV 4k UltraHd is way ahead of the competition. It gives you the best Picture Quality, Easy Connectivity, Built in Google Assistant for Voice Commands, Easy to Operate Remote with a dedicated shortcut TV button for direct access to your cable or set top box channels (this shortcut not available in other brands) picture added for reference. The Sound Quality is great compared to other brands sound bar not required unless and until you're a loud music freak. I have connected Boat Avante 1200 Sound Bar beacuse I had to purchase it for my MI TV as it was low on sound output. But I rarely use the sound bar while watching TV.\nVu tv comes with a Wall Mount Stand and saves you Rs 500 which is not there with MI TV. Last thing to add, Low Power consumption and Overall Excellent Built Quality.\n\nHighly Recommended This Vu TV to those looking for a good smart TV. Go for it guys and this review is based on my personal usage experience and not influenced by any YouTube channel.",
            "First time bought this Vu brand TV and online though hadn't the first choice brand tv. But the specs sheet is really impressive and earlier models also having good reviews.\n\n1. Picture clarity is really good with HDR and crisp. 5/5\n2. Sound is a bit average. would be good if speakers are front-facing like cinema TV (voice has good clarity rather than music) 4/5\n3. Connectivity is well responsive. (except casting lags) 3.5/5\n4. And booting time is a bit laggy. (as expected in Android)\n5. In the segment of 4K tv's price is reasonable with 2GB RAM & 16GB ROM\n6. Extended warranty (3 yrs) is given by Vu tv itself with fee compare to Flipkart's complete protection (third party) it is owned and service by Vu TV.\n\nHope Android updates will be periodical update the TV and life span shud be at least 4 years. And Flipkart rep has been agreed to give complete protecting scheme even after purchasing TV but they refused later by saying as ''Miscommunicated'' Poor policy\n\nGood to extend the warranty to Vu tv itself. Complete satisfaction of Product",

I ordered this tv when sale is live. I was scared little bit because of some negative reviews about other models in Vu. TV delivered on saturday and installed today (sunday). After seeing the Dolby vision and HDR 10 videos really impressed. At this price you will never get this much luxorious features like dual Wifi, Bluetooth, Dolby vision, HDR10 4K, Optical out etc. Really worth the price and thanks to flipkart for making this wonderful purchase. Also tested with my PS4 hdr , working great and colors produced are awesome. Go for this TV if your budget is below 25k. I have exchanged my old 32inch tv for INR 3500.

            "Great TV. With this price, you can't ask for more. I am writing the review after using it for 3 months. Everything is good except one thing I found peculiar. The TV remote control is using the battery like hell. I have changed 3 sets of batteries in last 3 months. I found that during the booting, the remote control doesn't work sometimes. But when I put new batteries, it works perfectly. I can't find the reason. Otherwise everything is good.",
            "Pretty Good in terms of everything, be it playing 4k videos, upscaling low quality videos , built in Chromecast and prime, so no need to shell out more money on firestick or Chromecast. However, if you are totally into features and free aps , then you can go for mi 4k TV's, but you need to compromise on picture quality and premium feel of clean Android OS.\nI opted for vu TV's because they are dealing with TV's only for a decade, not in other products like mi, lg or samsung , so they can easily focus on quality and industry standards.",

            "Review based on last one week of usage.\n\n100% used for watching online content (prime,hotstar,zee plus, Jio TV and Youtube). Since not taken Netflix membership, not used that.\n\nAnything above 720P or above giving me very good results. Few web serious watched over prime was mind blowing(1080p). Surprisingly it is at par with my brother's LG oled TV ,which is almost 130000.(I watched web serious \"The last ship\" through both and made the comparison)\n\nTrust me if you have very good broadband wifi connection ,it will give you amazing results. Using your phone's hotspot also good but if you are watching more online content I recommend to get you a good net connection.\n\nOverall I think upto around Rs.50000 if you are looking for a purchase this will do the trick.\n\nSound is okay. No issues when you are watching in a 12 feet room. Good vocal clarity. When it compares to Mi TV it is far better. Pls don't expect bass from any led tv speakers,for that you must get additional sound woofer.\n\nRemote's four direction button placement is not good. I always accidentally touch other buttons and ended up with going to home screen. You have to keep your eye on remote always to avoid the mentioned problem. They should have given good separated navigation buttons. LG magical remot is way better.\n\nApps are installing very smoothly. No lag.\n\nNo heating issues so far.\n\nGoogle assistant is really brisk and giving replies in great time. Great.\n\nNot connected to cable tv .so no idea about tye results.\n\nFinal words.\nIt is a really good tv if you give good input. Try to watch your content in 1080 p and don't regret. Yesterday watched \"Gulabo Sitabo\" in ultra HD and amazed with the clarity.",

Of course the picture clarity and upscaling engine /Color filter is not up to Panasonic, Sony or Samsung/LG level . But this is the best at this budget. Connectivity with Android is great. I have added a JBL so...\nREAD MORE",
            "TV is awesome and delivery was pretty quick.The Installation was done on the same day of delivery.\nI did purchased vu cinema tv but return it due to screen bleeding issues.\nNow review of this tv:\nPros:\n1. Sound is good enough of a room\n2. Picture quality is good for 4k but lags a bit 1080p\n3. No screen bleeding\n4. Better specs than vu cinema\n5. No lags till now\nCons\n1. No info of the processor used\n\nI will post further in upcoming days.",

            "Vu TV is value for money. Good picture quality, Decent audio. Turning ON TV from main will take time, but turning ON from remote later is quick.TV delivered in time and installation service agent was polite and knowledgeable.",
            "I watched almost all reviews of all TV's and i bought this VU 55\". Here are my findings.\n\n*Bigger the size better, but upscaling should be good bcoz not all videos you are going to watch are 4k or fullhd. Vu upscaling is good.\n\n*It's better to go for Android TV than Samsung or LG OS. Coz u get so much freedom in usage and more than enough apps. U don't need dish/cable/settopbox/firetvstick.\n\n*Its better if u don't install games in TV. Use TV as screen and connect a console or pc for gaming.\n\n*All Led TV's have less life span compared to plasma or lcd or crt TV. Can't do anything. Take extended warranty for peace of mind. Mostly led panel gets damaged due to lightning and surge.\n\n*I avoided all Chinese brands. Also Mi TV has poor clarity. OnePlus is way too expensive. TCL will get damaged soon. VU is Indian.\n\n*Vu is the best TV right now. Its been 1 month. I found no cons in this TV. Price is also way too less.\n\n*Place the TV straight to your eye. When u sit your eyes should be going right before the centre of TV. Universal law for Viewing distance= size of TV x 1.5\nEx: 55x1.5= around 6 feet.",

            "It's a good budget tv. Happy with product.",
            "First of all picture quality of the pannel is too good for this price point. It is a descent pannel with good color reproduction and very bright backlight. The speakers provide good quality output with a reasonable base frequecy. Surround sound effect brings the bass but you won't be able to hear the vocals clearly. You may feel uncomfortable with the sound settings for the first time. Background music will always be in a higher volume than the vocals even if we enable dialog clarity. Better find a sound setting that suits your room by trial and error method through all the settings. Or if you have a home theatre or soundbar then it will be good. But the TV is so loud that i don't even go above 30 as volume where 100 is the maximum. After a month and half of usage the issues which i faced or facing is whenever you keep idle the set top box for some time and when you turn on the set top box thr TV says weak/no signal. When you restart the TV that solves the problem or sometimes you may have to select the composit TV option from the input selection. There are minor glitches in youtube. Youtube randomly fails to sign in back when we go to home and press youtube button again. You can play almost all 4k yuotube videos without any lag but some videos shows some lag. Connectivity is very good. Connects seamlessly to blutooth headset in my case, wifi and lan. It also connects to 5GHz wifi which is a nice feature. Since the remote controller is a bluetooth based remote the batteries won't last as you see in normal TV's. Overall it is a great value for money. Dont expect too much from the play store. My overall rating is 4 on 5.\n\nAfter a year of usage, the tv pannel shows a group of dead pixels as dark spots randomly, but after a couple of weeks the spot disappears, again it re appears at a different location and disappears again after some weeks. Feels like burnt pixels.",
            "The best smart tv in the market at a very reasonable buy. If you're doubting the performance of the tv, I would like to tell you that I've used it for quite a long time now. It is a value for money. Must buy \ud83d\udc4d",
            "Clarity, sound and connectivity is awesome, Just go for it.\nDon't look for MI and other budget brands. VU would make you satisfied for the money you spend. 55 inch model looks very classy and rich. Google Voice assistant works very nice and sharing content thru WiFi is great. Connected internet thru LAN and there is no buffer from the day I bought the TV.\n\nIf you still have confusion, leave it off and go for VU.\nEither go with Premium or Ultra, both are same models.\nFrankly NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BOTH MODELS.",
            "The TV is real value for money. The interface is very good. I am using it as full internet TV and very happy with its performance. The 4K videos are awesome to watch. Loved it and recommend it for everyone seeking very good quality at reasonable price",
            "Excellent no need to buy sony, samsung, LG, & all other led. VU is the best price best quality equipped all features. It's Android based , Google Play Store available, you can install and update any app 16 GB memory 2 GB ram you can connect blue tooth headphones best picture quality and so many other features which are not available in high price LED I suggest everyone to buy this don't waste your money on costly LED Thanks VU",

            "I bought the 43 inch model, great picture and sound quality, very loud. 4k videos look amazing. Connects seamlessly with my home wifi or even mobile hotspot. Plays online videos in 4k with ease. It connected my pen drive and 1 tb external hdd with ease as well. We bought the flexible wall mount from the installation guy for Rs 1.5k. Imo, they should have provided the flexible one in the box instead of the standard one, it's way way easier to access the ports and adjust the tv position as needed with the flexible mount.\n\nInstall the app called Thop Tv, it has every live tv and radio channel and every streaming service as well including our Indian ones, you can watch them all for free. You'll have to sideload the app. With this app, you won't even need dth connection.",
            "It\u2019s really awesome I compared this tv with other branded tv\u2019s after that I concluded this tv is \ud83d\udcaf worth able to purchase for this price it has more features and computate equally with branded tv\u2019s like Sony Samsung and all",
            "Colours are good and vivid. Refresh rate is not that good. You can observe some lag in the frame rate as compares to Sony/Samsung 50 inch 4K LEDs, but given the price difference, it is justifiable. Sound quality is not very good but also not very bad. Connectivity is good enough, ample ports, Bluetooth linking is seamless, Chromecast works perfect, WiFi connectivity is good. TV is easy to set up and use. Initial booting up (when TV has not been in use for multiple hours) is a little time consuming (30-40 seconds), but after that it boots up instantly. TV unit looks very modern, sleek and stylish, so that's a plus.\nAll in all, a terrific deal for <30k.\n(Note - Don't forget to avail extended warranty.)",

            "PICTURE : 4\nSOUND : 3.5\nCONNECTIVITY : 3.5\nVALUE FOR MONEY : 4\n\nPicture quality is great when considered with its price point. But not comparable with Sony as I have Sony as my primary TV in Hall. But its contrast is very good. You will get pure blacks.\n\nSOUND quality is average. But if you connect sound bars with dolby audio, you can feel the difference while watching movies. For an average user it's OK. But if you are a audiophile than you have to add sound bar to it.\n\nCONNECTIVITY : you will get all the connecting options in the TV. Wifi can be connected easily.\n\nOverall it's a value for the money you have spent on this TV considering the price you have paid. I paid 32k and really happy to get the TV for this price. My dad is very happy by seeing this TV in his bed room. You can go for it..",

            "I am a tech enthusiast and was looking for something good under 70 thousand rupees. After going through many products and their reviews I realized many big brands have inferior quality products at high price due to brand value.\nBut these companies like VU,MI,TCL were providing good on-paper specifications for the price. I was having doubts before buying as I looked at negative reviews thoroughly. It was like a gamble I took. They had 10 day return or exchange policy so I took the gamble. And it was worth it. I am not saying those negative reviews are fake, I think they are just bad luck. But there is warranty and return policy so it's a benefit.\n\nOne con I find is, if your room has sunlight coming, there will be reflections on dark scenes so consider having curtains.\n\nSound is good not the best, I don't require sound bar, it is loud and clear enough for one room. Enabling \"Surround sound\" makes the sound feel like coming from all over the room even with just stereo TV speakers. I don't disable it now ;) .\nYou may require sound bar if you have a big hall. Bass is good, speech mode comes handy for dialogue clarity.\n\nI installed ethernet cable for better 4k streaming and it works without buffering. I have 50 mbps plan so considering that.\n\nHDR feel is 8/10. I mean what more do you expect?\nHDR clarity is 9.5/10( it is due to 4k resolution, nothing to do with HDR I think).\n\nViewing angles are excellent for one room, not for a big hall.\n\nI had a VU TV before but it accumulated dust patches inside panel, I had Extended warranty which helped me, I think I will have Extended warranty fir this one too.\n\nOver all a good deal. Wanted to give 4.6 stars but there is option so giving 5.",

Sound settings need to change.\n\nHighly dis-satisfied with the installation person, despite very low review I don't understand why Flipkart is continuing with Jeeves.\n\nInstallation person claimed that TV can't be wall mounted and when I saw the invoice received from Flipkart, it is paying 1000 which is free for us but what is the use. I paid extra 600 to electrician to wall mount the TV, when outside person can wall mounted why expert can't do and what is the purpose of giving free installation.",

Sometime it takes long time to connect during casting and sometimes software creates a problem.\n\nBut that is minimal and every android tv can be considered as an android phone, so rarely you will find any drawback in this tv.\nI will surely recommend this tv to everyone and also it is an american based company so anyone who is not willing to buy MADE IN CHINA products can surely look ou for this budget android tv with a lot of specs",

Sound quality is good but not great clarity. I feel at certain scenarios too much of mid frequency sound which makes us feel too loud. No word to talk about pic quality even at low bright, low backlight it still shows visible and clear picture with expectations of fine tuning. Wifi, works flawlessly. HDMI my Mac too a while to detect, not sure if it's a problem with tv or Mac. ARC, optical, audio out, composite, LAN yet to test, but fulfilling most of my requirement so far and happy with expectations. Will update with my findings after few more days of usage.",

            "My family is a hardcore Sony product fan, every electronic device on our house is of SONY brand. TV, Music System, DVD Player etc. However few months back just before the lockdown my Sony TV succumbed to death :( . I wanted to buy a new TV but this time I wanted to experiment and experience a new Brand, at an affordable price range. After doing lot of research i zero down to MI and VU. However, I never saw any MI tv in action in my day to day life. But VU tv i used to see installed in a lot of places i.e Conference halls, Institutes, Malls, etc. Thus i decided on purchasing VU tv. and boy I really loved my choice.\nIn my opinion, its the best bet in this price range, the TV is sleek and without any dust attracting pockets around it like other TV's. The picture quality is excellent. For me the sound of the TV is good. However for kids and young people who watch their TV on a very loud sound will not like the sound output of the device. But this problem can be curbed by external speakers.\nThe installation provided by Jeeves was super-fast, smooth, and without any hassles. They are very professional and swiftly executed their work with minimum invasion and no mess at all with the installation.\nVU customer care also provided me with an additional 4 months of warranty. which was like a cherry on the cake.\nMy suggestion would be to go for a biggest screen model if you have space.",
            "Awesome Purchase \ud83d\udc4d. Great top quality product from the house of VU. Looks great and sound also good. Main attraction is it's display, just awesome \ud83d\ude32. Only lacks installation. Flipkart assured installation service is Very bad, just worse ever experienced. They don't install my product since 7 days after delivery, last I'd install with local guy for paying extra Rs.200. Contacted customer care of Flipkart they raise a complain, but nothing happens, even I gave them a another installation address but they helpless. I'm plus member this is the first time I feel cheated. But except that TV is super, fabulous. One more thing, I noticed the chromecast facility is not up to the mark. Sometimes it failed to connect. I think the manufacturer solve this issue with software update. Love VU & Flipkart",

            "Definitely a great product. However it needs a few tweaks here and there, for example You need to turn off Truvolume HD and Truesurround X while playing Dolby encoded or normal audios, otherwise the vocal clarity would be pathetic. While playing the DTS sounds these should be turned on. Also selecting Theatre sound preset gives a better sound than all other modes. Dolby Vision looks good on the panel but HDR isn't that great. Netflix supports Dolby vision content on this tv and you would the logo flash up whenever a supported content is streamed. At this price it is certainly value for money and a good tv too. Nothing much to complain about.",

But 50 inch TV having 60 hz refresh rate is really bad, especially while watching cricket. You can hardly see the pictures clear, all you see is blurry image in fast motion. Any picture with speed cannot be viewed clearly. I dnt suggest people to buy this TV especially who like to watch sports and thriller movies. you cannot enjoy!!! Motorola TV's are really good i Feel. The blacks are not perfect, dark scenes and black shades are look worst. Lot of blue tint. Doesn't give a pleasing effect to ur eyes.\nEg: the colors of hair, blacks, dark scenes have dark blue and purple tint. So the black don't appear black. i hope you understand!\n\nMy review: dont buy",

Cost wise very economical, if you want to purchase same with LG or Samsung, it will cost just double.\n2. TV looks good and stylish with nothing much eye popping.\n3. Pen Drive slot works perfectly.\n4. With 2GB RAM it works perfectly, it gives you ease to download more apps on playstore.\n5. Colors are vibrant and soothes to eye.\n6. I have checked Netflix, it works fine. I guess rest also will work same.\n\nCon's :\n1. I have bought TV for my parents, they will only watch SD channels trough Tata Sky. So it's bit odd, the picture clarity is not perfect. I have bought the TV thinking it will give quality picture. I have checked HD channels, it gives clearer picture than SD. If you connect through OTT platform or Youtube, the picture is good.\n2. The sound quality is not so good. When we play any serial or film, the music is loud but vocals many times are not understood.\n\nThis two points are very important and it does not stand well in this two aspects. So if I had the option earlier and known this cons I will surely go for standard TV's since it was for my parents. But I thought why not give them 4k and I somewhat regret but \"FINE\"...",

            "Advantages\n1)This is the best tv. I was. buying a sony tv first. It was 8000g but when I saw the speakers its was of 24 watts and Vu gives us 30 watts. So the sound quality is much better than sony x8000g.2)We didn't compared the picture quality but this tv has Dolybivision which sony does not support.3) I think you should buy it as 43 inch size or 50 inch comes below 40.000 that is a major advantage as sony's 43 inch x8000g comes at 60000. So it is major differnce. 4)I suggest that you should go for it as sony samsung and lg sell thier tv at high prices because of their brand name. Though somy is also a south korean company but due to its name people buy their tv's and earn profit. VU is an indian tv.You should definately go for it.\nDisadvantage\n\nVu tv comes with wall mounted stand that is not slim at all and takes more than half of the space than the size of tv. So for people who have any bed or not have a lot of space to walk in front of tv then they should think",

All features are doing great job respecially 4k tv with all features in one box and really thank Vu brand (common man brand)and flipkart forget about brand like Sony,Samsung or LG etc just go for it Vu .I love it.",
            "I bought VU Premium 43 inch TV around 2 months ago. So far, there is no issue with software or hardware.\n16gb storage gives less chances to lag. Browsing through applications is smooth.\nPicture quality is very good, it supports 4k very smoothly.\nAudio is also good, 30w speakers gives more than enough quality for a medium sized room.\nGoogle Chromecast is one of a best feature of an Android Tv compared to other TV's own casting mechanism.\nPersonally, I would highly recommend it for a budget friendly TV.",
            "Flipkart took 4-5 days to deliver and 1 day delay in installation.\nTv seems good as of now as evident by star rating. Sound, picture everything is great. If you are a knit picker in sound quality then invest >40k in good sound system, else this tv sound is fine for normal home use.\nWhat remains to be seen is how long does this tv can go without any issue.\nWill keep posting the updates.",
            "I am writing this review after after using it for 7 months. The TV has been performing very good. I never had any issues in terms of wifi connectivity app usage etc.\nI already had a 43\" VU TV in our living room. I bought the 55 \"one for our master bedroom. I have to admit that the quality of video and audio at this price is the best you can get.\n\nWe have observed that the audio quality of this TV is better than our 43\" Android TV. I think the our TV is a different model. One does not have to use an external sound bar etc to enhance the sound quality. The built in speaker is more than enough.\n\nI would recommend this TV to anyone who is looking for a budget friendly TV.",
            "100% satisfied with this purchase. The smart TV works wonders and has ask the features. I have stopped using tatasky and only use OTT apps with this TV.

Picture quality is not up to the mark as they have mentioned as UHD. Connectivity weakens when opting for full HD irrespective of full signal strength.\nComing to audio, I am facing lots of issues. No optical connectivity option in the sound. No sound when tried connect HDMI to soundbar.\nThe only Pro factor is good looking built design with minimal bezels. But that is not sufficient for 37K.\nI have opted for Return & Refund. Waiting for approval from Flipkart end.",

It works well with HD and above quality videos.\nFrom exterior perspective, TV looks premium and a quality product.\nFrom interior perspective, the configuration of Software and hardware provided are best as compared to other TVs config of same or above price range.\n\nCons:\nOnly once I faced my internet videos getting stuck and not playing videos properly. Took lot of time in finding solution on net but didn't find any. Just restarted the aTV and issue got resolved.\n\nOverall the product is good and value for money.\n\nWill refrain from commenting any further until 3-6 months of usage.",

The TV is packed with all the latest features and have a very stunning sleek looking design. Display is great but it struggles sometimes in dark scenes though. The 30W speakers are good in the class and are able to create Surround sound effect precisely. If you are looking for a budget TV then you should definitely go for this one.\n\nMy overall ratings are 4.5/5 based on Value to Money comparison.\n\nEdit: For those who are asking - VU is an American company founded by an Indian.",

            "Great budget oriented product.\nReview after 45 days. After lots of comparison between many products. Choose vu tv best in quality, best price in this range. Comparing with many top brands with higher price with less options vu is the best choice. If any 1 are thinking about the buying this product go without 2nd thought. Till now no issues with tv. -1 rating bcz booting takes little more time to start up. Rest all working fine.....one of the reason to buy vu tv is it's not a Chinese product. Encourage swadeshi products. Jai hind. Thank you",

            "The picture quality is excellent, easily comparable to any other brand. The sound, despite being Dolby, is average, due to no sub-woofer present. The connectivity like Bluetooth is efficient. I faced no problem when used it. The only wish I have is a higher refresh rate as videos involving fast movements are not that clear. Dolby vision a treat to eyes. This TV is highly praised for two things - picture and connectivity.",

            "Review after 6 months of use\nLooks very good when you buy.. or even for the first month. Then start to show true colors.\nCons\n1) Poor processor - android app lags, many 4k videos lag, UI is very clunky\n2) Wifi keeps on getting disconnected\n3) Casting doesnt work properly. After 3-4 pics it simply stops\n4) Poor graphics. cannot play games, lag and FPS drop when you play 4K games\n\nOnly good is low cost for a 65inch TV. but now that feels like wasted money. Hence 2 stars\n\nBuy if you want to view Tata sky type content on 65 inch screen. Any additional functionality (like casting, gaming, 4-8K videos) and this TV will give up after 5-6 months",

Even after my internet was later fixed, still the TV was slower, and the installation person was clueless. After almost struggling for one day, was about to return the TV, I resolved it myself by doing a factory reset of the TV. Sharing this as it might help someone.",

In our case we identified the issue of screen Flickering ( names getting tilted) while watching the news channels the bottom lines which reflects names and news all of those were flickering. We raised this concern with VU service team at first they were in denial mode and gave reason like we have issues with out setup box and the cable we are using is not transmitting clearly. Still we pressed for them to come and check so they came and agreed that this TV had an issue. This whole process took a week after a couple of follow ups and call. Post this it came to flipkart's end and arranging for the new TV and getting the replacement done . This was a big lesson learnt for us and will never be ordering such an expensive item from Flipkart again. After breaking my head every day with multiple customer service agents and follow up on social media they made the replacement happen after 20 days on the issue raised. Each customer service agent will ask you to explain the issue from scratch as if they do not see anything in their own system , the social media team will keep on saying sorry for the inconvenience with no intent to get resolution. Please note that Flipkart will never arrange for Un installation it is on the hands of the delivery boy who will come with the new replaced TV to manage the uninstallation process and in that if anything gets damaged then it will your responsibility so please make a video while they do the uninstallation.

It seems loud even at 20 mark. Buy a sound bar and you are set for theatre like atmosphere. 10/10\n3. Remote is very responsive and of good build quality. But it is slippery, so be careful to jot drop it.\n4. Screen to bezel ratio is well thought of and gives us an immersive experience.\n\nCons:\n1. The voice response (microphone) on the remote can be better. It does not capture as well it is expected.\n2. Sometimes.. Not often the remote misbehaves and goes a few clicks ahead rapidly.\n\nOther than these no flaws yet. I will update after few months of use. But I will highly recommended you to buy it.",

            "Review after 15 months\nPros\n1. High brightness, sharp and good picture.\nIam using below settings\na. By default backlight is set to 100, disable\ndynamic backlighting, set it to 45-50(I set it\naccording to my room light). Viewing tv at 100%\nbacklight caused me eye strain.\nBrightness-50, contrast-50,\ncolor-60, sharpness-1 to 5,\ncolor temperature-low, active contrast- high,\nnoise reduction- high, digital noise reduction-low\n\nb. It has Dolby digital Plus and its effects are\nnoticeable. But the dialogs are not loud or\nfocussed.\nEnable trueBassHDX, TruSurroundX, dialog\nClarity. These will give high bass and surround\nsound effects\n\nCons\n1. Wifi stopped working after 6 months, after 8\nmnths ethernet also not working. Wifi stopped\nworking after updating android. Lot of people are\ncomplaining about connectivity issues.\n\n2. Sound output is ok. It is not focussed. External\nspeakers are recommended.\n\n3. Tv remote batteries need to be replaced\nfrequently. Google voice assistant does not work\nproperly with remote.\n\n4. We buyed movable wall mount from installation\nguy, he charged 2500, but you can get it below\n1700 in flipkart.",

It's delivered and installed within 24hours in a three tier city.\n\n*Delivery:* I personally never have seen this kind of fast and awesome delivery service by E-kart/ Flipkart. I ordered on 5th August 12pm and it got delivered on 6th August 9 AM in a three tier city which is nearly 280km away from Metro city. And it's installed in the same day of delivery.\n\n*Installation:* I am very very happy with the quick service of VU/ Flipkart/ Jeeves. Because it's delivered on 6th August 9 am and received call from Jeeves service centre on 10 am and it got installed on 12PM same day. But the installation guys are not properly aware of the products each options. And there were in hurry in everything. They just wanted to fix it on wall mount and switch it on and wanted to go. They are not likely to give proper demo in casting screen / internet connection. Mobile internet speed was down at that time. They just check once from their mobile and it was not getting connected, so they started insisting to share the OTP (happy code ) of installation to them and let them go as they are having more work. Now my query is only one. How a person who is not aware about smart tv will be aware of the functions if there is no demo given. Flipkart I would like to bring your notice on this.\n\n*Picture quality:* I am using this since last 3 days. The picture quality is awesome. Even when we cast the screen from mobile and play low quality video, it's showing hd types. 4k videos are playing like anything. We got spellbound by this. Picture quality of this tv is way better than MI, Thompson as I have personally checked these brands UHD / 4k tv in friend's house and also it is way better than even Samsung FHD, UHD tv( which are in 30-40k price range ).\n\n*Sound Quality:* It has Dolby audio and sound quality of this tv has having a lot of options. Bass is good, sound quality is good.\n\n*Connectivity:* Internet connectivity from mobile hotspot is quick and it's not lagging. Working very well even when internet speed is low. Casting screen is just a click away from Google home. Awesome connectivity.\n\n*Quality of processor:* 2gb ram, 16gb rom ( 11 gb free at the time of installation). Processor is also fast.\n\n*Look:* It look awesome as it's very thin side strip. It will give pleasure to your eyes I am assuring that. I liked it's style very much. The another plus point is in wall mount it's having enough space to put pendrive, data cable, LAN cable as in back side it's having space to put your hand for using the hdmi options unlike other tv.\n\n*Google assistant:* I only feel there is some lag in Google assistant as it's not working well all the time.",

As for the service, my remote stopped working but the brand sent me a replacement within 4-5 days in the middle of the pandemic, so I'm satisfied in that regard as well. As per my experience, I'm posting a comparison with other TVs in the same range.\n\nPros:\n- 2GB RAM, 16GB ROM. It works like a charm, never had a hiccup in performance. I can install as many apps and games as I like.\n- Dolby Vision HDR. Netflix and Disney+ Hotstar support it already, more platforms will in the coming time. This is absolutely gorgeous.\n- Dual-band WiFi support. All fiber internet connections support higher speeds on the 5GHz band which is supported here, some other brands don't.\n- 4K 60FPS support through the HDMI port if you want to use your laptop to see a movie.\n- The speakers are ample loud and of good quality supporting Dolby Audio. There would never be a need for external speakers or soundbars.\n- Wakes up from sleep mode super fast, in like 2 seconds.\n\nCons:\n- No MEMC, but that's not a major thing for me.\n- No Dolby Atmos support.",

U can notice That the queries asked by customer's in flipkart is answered by it's customer service provider itself. I am really proud with my choice. Going with Samsung and sony TV is a worst experience with regards to cost, lifetime, experience etc. According to me VU TV is NO 1 TV. But remember to add on complete TV protection for any TV you buy because lifetime of every TV is just 5 to 6 years. Finally i conclude this by saying that whoever gonna buy this TV, you will be 100% satisfied.",

            "The TV is 100% value for money.\n\nSound:\nGreat with plenty of presets and options to get the best experience. It also has a feature TruVolume HD that sort of manages the highs and lows during movies which have loud music but muffled dialogues. You will not have to adjust the volume that frequently thanks to this feature...and can set the volume and forget.\n\nYou won't need a separate home theatre system or a sound bar.\n\nPicture:\nCrisp. Blacks and whites and overall colours are accurate. There again plenty of customisation settings and has great contrast.\n\nAlso, the good part is you can set the picture and sound settings per app and input settings. So if you set a picture and sound setting for say your usual cable / set top box it will stay the same even when you change the settings for another app say YouTube, Prime, Netflix etc. So again you don't have to keep adjusting stuff a lot everytime you switch apps or switch to normal cable TV viewing.\n\nGreat upscaling:\nConsidering this is a 4k TV upscaling is critical. VU does a good job with it too. Upscaling is needed since not every content is 4K. You will be watching a lot of HD content and channels and even SD channels in your day to day use. The upscaling done for such videos and channels is very good. On a 50 inch 4K TV you will not see a lot of blurring or pixelation of SD channels. HD content is no problem at all.\n\nOverall you will get good quality picture in most cases.\n\nUI:\nSmooth, fluid and fast.\n\nRemote:\nWell thought out. Google Assistant works flawlessly. Has all the buttons you'd need including mute, standby and switching between TV and apps with a single button which a lot other brands tend to skip.\n\nIt also has buttons for most common streaming apps - YouTube, Prime, Hotstar, Netflix.\n\nOverall the TV is value for money. The only small con perhaps is the VA panel which is ONLY a problem IF you tend to watch the TV sitting at an extreme angle... Say 160-180 degrees... Which is very very rare.\n\nBut you will not find any issue in viewing the TV under normal circumstances.\n\nThe great thing about the VA panel is the crispness of the picture and the contrast you get. Much much better than and IPS panel.\n\nOverall if you pick this one over any other TV you won't regret.\n\nPure value for money.",

            "I don't know how good other 4k TVs are , but i noticed that this (Vu premium 50\") Tv's viewing angle is very less . The picture gets yellowish when looked from the side. So you can experience best picture clarity (actual colour) when you're watching it from a perpendicular line to the Tv +or- few angle. But this few angle is relative to the size of the room.so if you have Bigger room and sit far from the tv ,this won't be a problem. But if u have a smaller room and u site to the tv sidewise then you will be seeing yellowish display ...Other than this i don't feel anything bad about this tv .all good .",

Thick at the bottom. Rest 3 edges are absolutely thin.\n- Overall thickness of the TV is less as well.\n- It gives a classy look all around.\n- The connection slots are at the sides which provides comfortable access.\n- The stands are metallic and sturdy.\n\n*Picture Quality\n- Undoubtedly this VU meets it's standards as promised.\n- The picture quality is excellent. It stands with the competition against high end TVs from Sony/LG/Samsung.\n- SD channels definitely show low standards quality but the HD channels/HD Videos from YouTube and other apps are crystal clear.\n- Colours are bright with sufficient backlight.(I use it at less than 50%)\n- The blacks are true deep blacks.\n- No complaints of any colour leakage aur LED panel issue.\n\n*Audio Quality\n- The sounds are rich and provides the quality according to the mode set in such as theatre/live/sports/etc\n- The only setback here is the overall sound volume is low which is felt when any Bluetooth device is connected as the sound output.\n\n*Connectivity\n- HDMI ports. One of them with ARC connectivity.\n- Seamless connection to wi-fi.\n- BLUETOOTH SOUND OUTPUT HAS A LAG.\n\n*User Interface\n- Android 9.0 OS is smooth with sufficient RAM.\n- Easy and smooth operation.\n\n* TV Remote\n- Connects with Bluetooth.\n- Has Google Assistant key with a mic.\n- Separate keys for Hotstar/Prime/Netflix.\n- No idea about the battery usage yet.\n\nOverall the TV is best in line with the price it requires.\nHad compared with other TVs such as Nokia/Mi/Motorola, but I find this one the suitable budget TV currently in market.\n\n* Had purchased 2 years extended warranty from Jeeves along with the order.\n\nThank you.",

Btw, dont go with the California branding, Its a sham. But be proud of the Make in India and its a great TV with solid performance, colors, sound and picture clarity!

The requirement of sound is low in our household - the sound output given in most review says could be louder- for me sound is much more than enough. Very good visuals.

With new batteries the remote works properly. No complaints with new batteries.",
            "Picture quality is based on the source of the content you view. You cant expect 80s movie to be in 4k quality in this TV.\nExpect Google assistant to search content only in You Tube, so don't think it will give answers like Alexa.\nAs you load more apps, expect a delay in starting the TV for the first time.\nSound quality is good, when you change from theater to music to sports to late night you will feel the difference. Wall mount sound setting definitely helps when your TV is wall mounted.\nWe have to talk about the size of the TV which is simply amazing, you get theater experience when you play movies with good sound.\nAudio only mode is added advantage.\nBuy it with offer and get 2 additional year warranty from the money you save. I planned in such a way using my credit card billing cycle did not take EMI but paid in 3 installments, so saved paying interest (food for thought).",

You won't get 55 inch in this cheap price with other brands like LG, Samsung, Sony, etc\n3. Picture quality is good and sound quality is not bad\n4. Remote is also good with dedicated buttons for some apps and navigation is fluid, no lag\n5. Navigation and remote is best compared to my other LG LED HD TV which I bought 1 month back for other room",
            "Ok product",
            "Here are some genuine Pros and Cons about this VU Premium 2020 Mode after using for a week.\n\nPROS:\nSuperfast Delivery and Installation by Flipkart (Got Delivery within 2 days and installation was done on next day by 9AM)\n\nIt is a full fledged Android TV with decent configurations and Android 9.0 which works well, I didn\u2019t find any major glitches, minor glitches I will mention in Cons.\nOn paper specifications are visible on end product as well,Dolby Vision,Dolby Atmos,HLG and DHR 10 features can be felt only when you watch content in Netflix.You can\u2019t notice it while watching HD content from your DTH or streaming others OTT applications.\n\nPicture clarity in DTH looks decent in HD Channels I won\u2019t say it looks great.\n\nSound output is good, it\u2019s loud and clear. But you have do some settings in audio to get best of it.\n\nBuild Quality is Decent\n\nThe hot keys and google assistant buttons given in the remote works great though the quality of remote is very poor.\n\nApps optimisation in OS is just ok, Not that great. Previously I was using a non Smart TV with FireStick and I did not find any noticeable difference in navigating apps and it\u2019s interface. Android have work on its optimisation.\n\nOne of the main reason behind my purchase was Android OS where you can install plenty of apps,games,and there is an option to sideload some apps which are not available in play store which i feel is the biggest advantage of an Android TV.\nYou cant find such flexibility in Tizen or WebOS.\nSo,Overall it is a good value for money product with good Picture,Sound,Connectivity,and specifications.\n\nCONS:\nRemote Quality is Bad, the buttons I don\u2019t think will last more than 6 months. It makes annoying sound while clicking,I just hate that sound.\nI got fitted it in my Living Room (Hall), and the viewing angles of this VA Panel is not so good,especially from corners are not that good, pictures looks washed out and faded from sides. Pictures look great only if you sit in front of the TV.\nAfter Sales service of Vu is not that great,service network is poor,hope they will increase the service centres in future.\nPrime vidoes lags a bit and takes little extra time to load. Sometimes TV freezes while navigating the apps on home screen hope they\u2019ll fix with an update.",

If you want to play 4k or 1080p videos from your phone you have to do it via DLNA (BubbleUpNp) which takes a lot of time to understand.\n\n*The usb ports are working fine but one time a port wasnot working and I was about to return then I tried to format it and it worked i don't know the reliability on a long run.\n\nUpgrade your TV cable connection to HD because SD channel look way better on a HD set topbox eventhough you don't have hd channels\nI actually don't know the reliability of this product on a long run.

            "I purchased this TV after researching all available brands both online and in stores. Am happy with my choice. Picture quality is good. Sound could have been better. Works well on pairing with a sound bar or external Bluetooth speakers. The installation guy will try to sell you a voltage stabilizer to go with the TV, which you can decide on merit. Would have given 5 stars hadn't it been made in China.",

            "First.... The sheer size. 65 Inches is absolutely amazing. Delivery and installation was over within a span of 24 hours of each other.\nA word of advice. Since the TV is Big.. So is the pixalation incase the content is non HD/poor quality.\nTo derive maximum benefit.. Make HD content available / have an Internet connection with speed 30 Mbps or above.\nThe damm thing is like a mini theatre.\nMighty pleased with the purchase.",
            "Worth for Money ... picture quality is excellent.... connectivity with all the devices are too good...but at sound quality side it is quite disappointing as all leds has the same issue.you need to add extra sound bar for more clarity.",
            "Brilliant product. Purchased at Rs.32499/-.\nGreat deal.",

            "Nice and convenient with such features in this price range..",
            "Better pictures quality with better dolby digital sound also connectivity is very good. Picture resulation is very good when we will see in HD channels.

The installation guy comes from Third party Jeeves. They sell extended warranty sneakily ( called jeeves warranty ) he shows some app n stuff. I was ok with buying extended warranty and wanted to buy one because VU is a budget TV .But who will buy with Jeeves ?This Jeeves can technically go out of business in the next 2 years and your extended warranty would be lost.

VU won't disappoint you. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nSound quality also good but I felt little noise while watching several videos. I tried to change the audio mode as well but didn't work. While watching videos in Apps like Voot, Amazon, Youtube I felt the sound like theatre, which was creating too much noise and voice was not clear.\n\nIn connectivity, I didn't find any issue till now. Though I didnt check all the ports available, but bluetooth, USB ports working fine.\n\nI faced bit issue with the remote keys in initial days. Navigation key stucked for some time and didn't perform properly. I have received bad batteries as well for the remote.\nI would request, please provide good quality batteries with the product.\n\nI feel Technical team also good.\n\nOverall the product is satisfactory.
