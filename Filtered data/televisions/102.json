It has the best quality as i checked and watched. Before buying I wanted to research and researched and found out that it's the best among all the TVs in this range.\nSo what are you waiting for guys if you want to spend a less amount and want a quality product then you must for this.\ud83d\udc4c",

Best in segment\nVoice could have been better but if go by price it's pretty much good\nPorts are working fine but difficult to insert cables n PD once wall mounted (not feasible to reach n insert in it)\nChromecast n Google assistant are working perfectly fine till now....\nLight weight remote.... Nice one.....it provides you many keys thus making it easier to use\nLittle or no lag issues\nGood WiFi connectivity",

Just for setting up the TV and connecting to my wifi router does not need an installation process.\n\nThe representative comes at his own time, you will not be able to get in touch with him to schedule a mutually convenient time, customer service is of no good, then he arrives at a mist inappropriate time, and not able to put up the wall mount because there is a nut missing in their mount and would ask you if you have some jugaad at your home to fit the peg in the hole.\n\nEventually it is waste of time with zero output, Flipkart should seriously consider having some quality control on their third party partners. Exasperating experience!!\n\nRegarding the product, it is average. I wanted to buy a low budget TV and had no specific expectations. And so is it, average picture (like beauty mode selifie in chinese mobiles) quality, average sound quality, decent connectivity. Works for me, but if you have higher expectations for TV experience, this isn't the one for you.\n\nRegd connectivity: remote sensitivity low, optical output does not work",

Guys this is TV. Not washing machine or Fridge. We have to fix on the same day to watch TV. Please make some improvements on installation procedure. (Don't say it's lockdown or Covid - normally it's like that only based on my study of reviews from the previous buyers.) You guys making us to get scared to open the TV ourselves. Only fact you coming for installation is to confuse us to fix wall mount by charging extra price. Even if we have already mounted or new wall mount we have. You guys won't allow us.\n\nWill let you know the product review after few days...",

            "Infinix X1 LED TV is one of the best and most economical product in the market, we have got numerous features and specifications like eye care and many more with in built application like Netflix etc. Which was missing in Realme and MI TV.\n\nMost importantly, we are very surprised that infinix is having more than 1000 + service center across India , No worries of getting service wherever we relocate.\n\nOur family is very Happy with product.\nValue for money.\n\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude0a\ud83c\udf8a\ud83c\udf89\u2728",
            "Thank you Flipkart & Infinix barnd\nSorry I'm not happy this product Because Before I'm using samsung 5300 32inch sarees Its tv display is so good but Infinx tv display is not good it is quality bad and Look side angle video Doesn't look good\nAnd app supports also slow totally I'm saying this product 50%Good 50%bad",
            "Great product from infinix picture quality is superb sound is little bit low compare to 24w speaker but if you have small or medium hall then no issue built quality is good and user interface is smooth sometimes lack but smooth",
            "Writing after 20 days of use, it is a good TV. Sound quality ia good, picture quality is good, smart remote has voice input also. Overall good purchase",
            "The best television brands are always Sony, Samsung, LG because of their panel, picture and sound quality. Other brands like Mi, Vu are all secondary brands and the quality difference compared to the best brands are very much visible without looking at the specification itself. This is where I was amazed getting the Infinix television. The specification comparison with brands like Samsung was sort of close to identical. After using it I will definitely say Infinix brand has every right to be among the list of best brands and not in the secondary brand list. We can check the screen quality by touching the screen and by doing so we will see pressure points. The best brands won't show lighter shade pressure points or no pressure points at all. But the secondary brands will have darkish pressure points. Infinix television has got only lighter shade pressure point. Anyone without technical knowledge could check the screen quality in this manner. I will write some pros and cons below:\n\nPros\n1. Great picture and sound quality.\n2. Great connectivity.\n3. Looks premium.\n4. Easy set up.\n5. Easy remote functionality.\n6. Installation was very good and prompt.\n\nCons\nHaven't seen any cons for this television as of now but I do want to check how the service centre experience will be like. That doesn't change the quality of the product though.\n\nGot this model for Rs 10,000+ which is a great buy because it's definitely worth Rs 20,000+. If you can't afford a Samsung or Sony, Infinix can become the next choice without compromising on quality.",
            "Should not buy.\nSound not good.\nPicture quality is not full Hd.",
            "Superb TV. Worth it. Must buy \ud83d\udc4d",
            "Ultimate video quality in this price. Must buy TV . Wifi Connectivity is awsm even it capture full networks where phone is not even connectong to wifi router.\nHdr support is superb ........ Love it",
            "Over all good but installation charge\nRs 499 given.",
            "I agree...Chromecast is totally disappointed. It's not working properly. I don't know how to handle this. The installer told Chromecast needs wifimodem then only it will works properly. Other brands Chromecast is very simple and elegant but Infinix put toughed. That's only main part in android tv. What is the use for Android tv? Infinix makes me so disappointed.",
            "Let's get the unimpressive out of the way. I'm not satisfied with the Android OS experience on this TV. The OS works fine and smooth for the most part, but on occasion the interface would lag, and button presses take several seconds to be registered. This occasional choppy UI experience doesn't feel pleasant at all. This may have to do more with issues in the Android OS than anything with the TV hardware. But, anyone looking for a TV specifically for smart features may look at other options in this price segment.\n\nNow, on to the display. I am overall pleased with the display quality. The display is a VA panel which produces good enough contrast. The downside of a VA panel is relatively poor viewing angles, which is not ideal for family viewing. For the colour reproduction, initially the colours looked off (too saturated) in the deep Reds. I went in the Settings and reduced the saturation for Red and then in the \"10 point color\" setting, reduced the saturation for Reds with 70% gain and above. And, this did improve the image, and now the colours look fairly balanced. Also, the Sharpness setting should be kept at zero, anything above adds artificial sharpening to the image.\n\nAnd the remote which connects via Bluetooth, works fine, has a textured back and feels nice in the hand.\n\nAll in all, for a dumb TV, this is a really good option. And, for smart features, I can't say how it compares with other similarly priced TVs.",
            "Tv has very good picture quality and there is no change colour when see by side so viewing angle also good, sound quality is much better than other brands so I like it, tv has very very slim bezels\nHere 1 gb ram and 8 gb storage is little disappointed\n\nFirst time when tv received it was defective it's have display issue so display not working so I requested to Repecment so when completed tech visit almost all done but flipkart cancelled my replacement so I tried to second time then second time successfully completed replacement also fencing delay on time to complete all work like tech visit was delay\nSecond tv instead of replacement was good there is no issue so all good\nI have one more suggestions that technician was come to install has like zero technical knowledge because he don't know which function have, I said to them to how operate so improve technical staff\n\nSo I give ratings for tv 9 out of 10\nFor service 4 out of 10",

            "The best television brands are always Sony, Samsung, LG because of their panel, picture and sound quality. Other brands like Mi, Vu are all secondary brands and the quality difference compared to the best brands are very much visible without looking at the specification itself. This is where I was amazed getting the Infinix television. The specification comparison with brands like Samsung was sort of close to identical. After using it I will definitely say Infinix brand has every right to be among the list of best brands and not in the secondary brand list. We can check the screen quality by touching the screen and by doing so we will see pressure points. The best brands won't show lighter shade pressure points or no pressure points at all. But the secondary brands will have darkish pressure points. Infinix television has got only lighter shade pressure point. Anyone without technical knowledge could check the screen quality in this manner. I will write some pros and cons below:\n\nPros\n1. Great picture and sound quality.\n2. Great connectivity.\n3. Looks premium.\n4. Easy set up.\n5. Easy remote functionality.\n6. Installation was very good and prompt.\n\nCons\nHaven't seen any cons for this television as of now but I do want to check how the service centre experience will be like. That doesn't change the quality of the product though.\n\nGot this model for Rs 10,000+ which is a great buy because it's definitely worth Rs 20,000+. If you can't afford a Samsung or Sony, Infinix can become the next choice without compromising on quality.",

            "It's my secondary TV and i purchased for my home office where I can occasionally watch some OTT series or live cricket. I exchange this with my 32 inch 10 yo LCD as i was struggling to watch OTT content on the same. So my initial first impresions:\n40 inch size is perfect for 12x12 room and it's very light in weight and also thin bezels.\nPros:\n1. Good picture quality, brightness is superb with 350 Nits ( but not to be compared with LG or Sony) l. Better than some rivals at similar price range.\n2. Bluetooth connectivity with my Bose soundlink is flawless with absolutely no lag/delay. However I noticed that audio gets disconnected for a sec intermittently during the video. If this is a Software issue, company should fix with update.\n3.Light remote however there was no need of number pad.\n4. Bezel less design and it's looks great in the wall.\n5. Sound is not great but not bad too, it's average. Dolby seems to be a gimmick.\n6. Lastly, it's high value for money\n\nCons:\n1. Biggest, why there is no 5Ghz wifi support?\n2. Wall mount is missing, they should at least provide screws for wall mount and just not for table top only.\n3. 1GB RAM with just 8 gb storage is letdown as there are many OTT apps nowadays. sluggish interface, takes around 2 minutes post restart for apps to become fully functional.\n4. 2 gen old Android version which is Android TV 9. Infinix can ramp up their sales by providing atleast Android TV 10. Some of other brands are already providing Android TV 11.\n\n\nOverall ,i like picture quality which is FHD and it's a great value for money if anyone is under 20k. Go for it, easily comparable with brands that offers same specs but at more price. Only apprehension, company should focus more on customer retention as to provide updates and more models to customers.",

The con mentioned above will be only experienced while screen casting. Other than that this tv is a good choice for buying.. You can go for it.",

The service guy will charge 1800 for it. If you already purchased it seperate. They will install for you, but they will not be happy doing it. The screws for the bottom area line wall mount was long which was not getting fit. he said me to do by myself as he don't have spare screws(he won't even provide if he have because I have purchased wall mount seperate). Finally they will convince atleast to do 3 year insurance which covers physical damage which I did it for 1k . Service guy got happy after taking insurance.\n3) Overall it's fine.",

Use Dolby Processing option to produce acceptable sound.\nConnectivity - No hassles with BT speakers or headphones. Enough ports for standard usage.\nRemote - Most disappointing feature, as voice commands are not supported. Even Google android TV remote from playstore doesn't connect. Other than that, remote has some good features with media control buttons as well. Seller OmniTechRetail avoided my questions very cleverly and removed the 43\" Remote control photo silently.\nOS - Sometimes it is laggy when TV has just started. Inbuilt Pango browser is just ok-ish. Haven't faced any lagging after 2-3 minutes of start. RAM usage is between 50-70% loaded or unloaded.",
