            "Picture quality is average, at every angle not like a qled tv. I think its panel is B grade. Picture settings needs very fine adjustment. Sound is average. HDMI arc port is not properly matching with sony home theater. Picture upscaling is also poor. So don't waste your hard earned money for such scrap tv. So don't buy TCL qled TV, rather go for 4K tv only if you want to purchase in this brand. However after installation I got two updates. Picture settings can be improved by software updates, hopes TCL fix this in future updates. If flipkart replace this tv with other brand without any money deduction then I will definitely prefer other brands. If I compare it with my earlier Vu premium Tv 50inch then in every angle Vu Tv is best.",
            "Hello all this is a really good TV\n1.Picture quality watching 4K on this tv is wow .. colors are wonderful blacks are deep, I watched Grand tour season 2, 1st episode in that they show super cars in Switzerland.. too good.\n2.sound I will not say it\u2019s the best but enough\n3.android on the tv is good response is nice .. not the fastest but good enough I would say...\n4.only negative point is that the panel is bit reflective and brightness is 330nits so if you are watching a very dark movie which has lots of blacks then you have make sure the room is dark to enjoy the movie to the fullest ( dark curtains should do the job)\nOverall I think it\u2019s value for money \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",

            "Writing this review after 5 months of usage.\n\n1.) 4K/UHD: well it really make a difference. Currently there is enough streeming content available by Netflix and Prime and watching true 4K content really brings out the best viewer experience from this TV. Even watching regularly 1080p content also good but hey I brought this because its 4K and it's worth the extra money over the standard FHD LEDs.\n\n2.) QLED vs OLED: Does this impact the contrast and colour depth? Yes and it does an amazing job. Compare this with any standard LED tv and you will feel the difference in the picture dept. A slight compromise if you compare the performance against a OLED but hey I have all my organs intact as I didn't have to sell any to bring home the QLED and I have no regrets.\n\n3.) The built in audio does a decent job. Plays most of the frequencies. But if you want a theatre like effect have a decent sound bar connected via ARC it's worth the investment.",

            "Tv looks good and the performance also good. But the installation was unsatisfactory.",
            "The TV is fine. Even though it is a QLED we don't feel the picture quality is good especially when you are viewing regular 1080 HD content. We watched Australian Open tennis and there is some lag in movement. For regular movies it's fine.\n\nMy reason for 1 star is because of installation. The person came and installed ok. Didn't know much about voice commands, etc. which is ok. The part that pissed me off is that he asked for Inr 250 for installation and argued that it is not free. I gave him the money and sent him off. The next day I got a call from TCL to check if I can put a review on Flipkart and the person was like it will only take 30 seconds and can you do it now. I informed him that the installation person took 250 for installation which should be free but then the rep was like it is not installation charges, it is for wall mount. The funny part is the wall mount is provided with the TV itself and we are not even using as we are using table top stand. Even after i told him this he kept going about the charge being for stand and covering up for the installation person taking money.",
