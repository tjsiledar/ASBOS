Overall, this is a value for money TV at this price point mainly because of the picture and sound quality(Major features required for an average everyday user). However, I will list down the pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n- Display is good and the colors are vibrant.\n- Speakers are good enough at this price.\n- Stereo speakers at this price and equalizer is available. (Didn't play around with it yet)\n- Screen Mirroring is available. It works fine with android devices and apple airplay.\n- I like the TV interface and it is clean. (It's is a personal preference.)\n- I don't find any slowness or app crash which I have seen with Mi Box and some other android TVs. (This might be my experience)\n\nCons:\n- Not an android TV. It runs on Tizen OS.\n- Stand was not shipped along with the TV. We need to rely on the installation team or should buy it ourselves.\n- TV remote could have been better.",

Because of the VA panel you will get the stunning natural picture quality. Also you will get the picture quality settings where you can adjust the brightness, contrast and sharpness according to your needs.\n\n2. With the 20W speaker the sound quality is awesome. You will also have the choice of adjusting the sound to different modes like standard, sports. As I am using Tata sky HD settop box with Dolby digital Plus sound so it is icing on the cake. The moment I activate the Dolby..oh boy!! It is on a different height. Outstanding sound output. Never go for the gimmick ads of 24W speaker, Dolby+, boom boom, blah blah. Believe me 20W is enough for you and your family. You are not going to open a disco in your society. The basic nature of a sound is soothing to hear. That's what you will get here.\n\n3. Next I will talk about the memory and OS. Something around 4.5 GB you will get and I will say that's enough for the Tizen OS. Let me tell you Tizen is the best OS in these competition. The optimization is superb. You will get all the apps in the store. Never go for the gimmicks of pure android. They are just fooling you with those words. The pure android TV os like realme is a waste of money. The lag you will feel on the first day of its use but in this samsung Tizen OS it is just flawless. The boot time is less than 2 seconds. Like with a blink of eye. The apps will run like a butter on the pan. The OS is so well optimised that I have installed 8 to 9 apps(like almost all the apps) still there is no notification about memory full and all.\n\n4. In terms of connectivity you will get all the ports. No issues with that at all. You can use it as a monitor also.\n\n5. For screen casting you need to have the app screen mirroring in your mobile. Yes your job is done.\n\n6. Another stuff I like is the table top stand it is providing. The best one. Not like those traditional Chinese TV stands.\n\n7. In the remote you will also get dedicated ott platform buttons like Netflix, Prime and Zee5. You can download Hotstar, SonyLIV, Apple TV from the store. Everything is available there.\n\nThere is no Cons regarding the performance but yes I will say samsung should have provided the wall mount tools inside the box. For wall mount you have to buy it extra from them. Otherwise the machine is superb.\n\nFlipkart service is outstanding. Delivered it within 15 hours of ordering. The installation service by Jeeves was also good.\n\nSo if you are searching for a smart tv in this range please go for it without a second thought. Let me tell you may be it is slightly on a higher price side but you will feel the quality. Never go for the gimmicks of realme and Mi. 32 inch is enough for a 2 to 4 members of a family. Just for some 1000 bucks margin never waste your money on those Chinese TVs. I am not saying just because they belong to china. I have personally experienced those TVs and finally went for this samsung.\n\nHope you guys have a clear idea now. Thanks.",

            "Good installation boy",
            "The product in over all is pretty good and has value for the money. The only problem that I feel, that this product has is the external audio connectivity. The TV has a digital audio output which requires a daac or digital to analog audio converter for most of the audio or home theatres to connect. Which is kind of not cool. The video quality is superb and the audio quality is also good. If you are someone who's looking for good picture quality at low rate and inbuild audio. This TV is a good choice.",

            "Tv is value for price. Picture quality and sound is pretty good.\nInitially I didn't faced any issues but after some time there are issues with screencast. You need to switch off and on the TV multiple times then your phone screen gets connected. Also initially the tv's boot time was pretty fast but now it's taking bit more time to boot might be because I installed one app (hotstar) on it but I think one app shouldn't make a difference. One major setback is that it doesn't have a voice controlled remote and it is not ease to type everything you want to search.\nOn a whole tv is good for a price. I got it for 12500 ( after applying discounts) if you are getting it even for less price go for it.",

Main thing which is missing is a analog audio output(it dont have RCA or 3.5mm audio output)\nonly HDMI ARC and optical digital output is there if u want to bring the audio out.\n\nCan improve:\n1.
