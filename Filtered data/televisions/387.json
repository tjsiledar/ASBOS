            "Very good TV\ud83d\udcfa. First cons:\n1: Linux OS so limited apps. No hotstar+ Disney and so on.\n2: Absence of Bluetooth.\nPro's:\n1: Picture quality is good. Feel like a full HD.\n2: Fast OS, open and close apps very fast.\n3: Good sound produce from 20w speaker.\n4: Built-in Google Chrome browser.\n5: Whenever exit from apps ecosystem it back to last viewed channel from my HDMI 1 DTH connection.\n\nSuggestion for Company: Company must add more app to this new OS. Including Hotstar, some top music apps etc. Adding Bluetooth will be advantage.\n\nSuggestion for new buyers: If u want TV with good picture clarity, fast OS they go for this.",
            "Great deal with great prize amazing priduct by toshiba & nice delivery & installation process by flipkart",
            "Value for money, Very nice picture quality,... I like mirror cast which work smoothly. Even though it is hd ready but it look like full hd tv with quality of picture..",
            "Finally third party Jeeves Installation completed after 6days of product delivery with lots of follow ups and escalation. Other than this highly irritated installation service follow ups, TV is brilliant and amazing with great price. Very good picture, sound and design quality and build than Sony.",
            "Since 3 month I am using this product sound performance look like a Dolby type screen clearty is also very good look like a full hd screen when you connected through pen drive or wifi through internet it sound and picture quality is awesome but when I connect through set top box (full hd) it little bit disappointed sound is look like a normal sound and clearty is look like normal led screen type I also try to change a setting but nothing happen but through pen drive and internet connect this led tv is awesome",
            "At this price range, this particular model from Toshiba is best. I was looking for non smart TV, but choices are very limited and their quality is also not up to the mark. Sony was having a non smart model, but the cost to shell out was at bigger side. Hence chosen Toshiba as choice, looking at its configuration and price range. This LED I have bought it as replacement for our old Samsung LCD television. Personally those who look for limited level of smart features, you can still bet on this model and it won't let you down.\nPersonally I know that during 80's till early 2k Toshiba was the market leader in picture tubes. So that describes the picture quality of this model. It is HD ready. For a 16*10 living room (hall) this TV set is sufficient. Sound Quality is good and viewing angle is also good.",

            "At this price range, this particular model from Toshiba is best. I was looking for non smart TV, but choices are very limited and their quality is also not up to the mark. Sony was having a non smart model, but the cost to shell out was at bigger side. Hence chosen Toshiba as choice, looking at its configuration and price range. This LED I have bought it as replacement for our old Samsung LCD television. Personally those who look for limited level of smart features, you can still bet on this model and it won't let you down.\nPersonally I know that during 80's till early 2k Toshiba was the market leader in picture tubes. So that describes the picture quality of this model. It is HD ready. For a 16*10 living room (hall) this TV set is sufficient. Sound Quality is good and viewing angle is also good.",

            "Good tv and sarvise is best",
            "Pros :\n1. supreme picture quality even at HD Ready. I have a sony full hd tv bought 5 years back as well. The clarity is same. Color difference because of sony Bravia engine is present. But toshiba colors(dynamic settings) are equally good. At 32 inch HD ready is enough. Toshiba picture quality is awesome.\n\n2. Build quality is very premium. The stand and bottom bezzel in silver color puts this tv ahead of its competitors all black design.\n\n3. Sound is average. You can manage by enabling the theatre and surround settings. But not the best out there in 32 inch TV's.\n\n4. No issues with connectivity. 2.5Ghz band works fine.\n\n5. Value for money\n\nCons :\n1. Lack of Hotstar, MX player. I connect my laptop using HDMI to watch Hotstar, but if the app was provided it would've been good.\n\n2. VIDAA os : Not the best interface, takes time to get used. True that hotkeys to access Netflix, prime and zee5 are there, but still not getting a good feel about the OS. Not an issue to me, but true not that friendly.\n\n3. App store : not worth mentioning\n\n4. Changed picture and sound settings keep getting reverted\n\nDelivery : was fast. But delivery person didn't know about open box delivery. May be it's because of my current location.\n\nInstallation :\nInstallation person had 0 knowledge about the TV.\nStole the wall mount set provided as I used the stand and forgot about the set. Didn't raise any issue as I did not need them, but still that's wrong. Worried about the service, praying God the tv runs fine atleast for 5 years. But thank God I atleast got a service person to install the next day after delivery. Lot of people have mentioned that they haven't got the installation for days.\n\nFinal verdict : Go for it if you want the best picture quality, ok-ish sound quality, can manage with VIDAA os, absence of Hotstar- at 32 inch segment.",
