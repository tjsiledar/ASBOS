            "Very good product. FlipkFlipkart delivered within 3 days as mentioned at the time of order. And after delivery the installation also completed on next day of delivery. Product received with little damaged, but it didtn return because it's negligible(Flipkart also agree to return), so I like the way they approach for return & replace. I am using the product since last one month and have no any problems. Cons.:1. Little but open from backside so issue of rats, insects, etc might occur. 2. Very low noise of compressor. Good point: 1. Very good rates provided by Flipkart, compare to others. 2. Good prompt delivery. 3. Good installation service even though on Sunday by Jeeves.",

            "Good buy. Delivery and installation happened as committed. So far good and having no issues. Do not look at buying any stand without checking with the installation person since the stands we see online are not recommended by them to withstand the weight and may also not fit properly.",

            "Nice product ....",
            "Very poor quality item they shipped\nItem totally different than picture\nAnd they told they can't refund and return as\nFlipkart always cheat with customer\n\nI really now believe ; people always right; that e-commerce website are big fraud",
            "The product shelf photographs are confusing as they show different types of shelf. Actual photograph only should have been posted.",
            "Wonderful product.",
            "Looking good and excellent performance",
            "Do not buy any white goods from flipkart would be my advice. They are selling factory discarded defective products. The fridge we received is making big noise from compressor. We wanted to return this defective noisy product but Godrej it seems is hand in glove with Flipkart. They told us that the noise level should not exceed 60 decibels and fridge is emitting 56 db. 60 decibels itself is a very high value in the house. And that is deliberately set this way so that defects can be covered up.\nIn a nutshell flipkart is a willing conduit for sale of defective, factory rejected products and by companies wishing not to accept their mistakes.\nDo not buy this fridge or any other from flipkart.",

Much spacious in comparison with other refrigerator in this range/volume. You will love it at first sight. After 15 days of use nothing adverse noticed. Automatically disconnects for frost free. All adjustable racks which can be customized as per your requirement. No stabilizer required. Overall a good purchase. I forgot to use No EMI option. Exchanged old one at a cost of 1800.

Hardly anyone makes ice cream and most Indians are Veg and don't require to store meat.

The fit and finish is just average in terms of cost cutting and it took 20 days to deliver and more over no service p\u00e9rson will come for installation. Very worst customer service support. They expect to install and use it with yourself. Just believing the motor would at least come for 10 years as it has warranty... Rest all very poor accessories and will not withstand even for 2 years...",
            "Though it has built in stabilizer, it can't handle more load(power fluctuations)...We need to buy external stabilizer if you have to have good life.. Within 8 months of purchase this fridge got damaged.. then Godrej service person checked and told us to buy external stabilizer as inbuilt one can't withstand more loads.. better buy a fridge without built-in stabilizer and install a new stabilizer..",

            "The product was delivered within 1 day after booked. The packing and delivery was neat and have no comment on their part.\nRegarding the product, it made of cheap plastic. The storage panel in the door is not quite conformable to hold multiple water bottles.\nThe place where the compressor is placed is not sealed. Also there are wires, visibly seen around that open area. If you have rats / cockroach in your house, you should be very cautious.\nThere is no issue with the cooling (both the compartments). Though all the racks were mentioned as \"Toughened Glass\", the beading around the glass is of very cheap plastic. Not sure if they can hold 150kg (as advertised).\nThe entire fridge doesn't looks like a 343L fridge (may be I replaced this fridge from 420L).\nThere is no issues so far with the fridge performance.\nAlso Flipkart and the seller did a good job in delivering on-time. The same with courier service too.\nThe installation guy just came to un-pack the cover and switched on the fridge. He did nothing more that.",

            "No major functionality issues with the product, however the overall experience of buying a refrigerator online was pathetic. Issue started when we first opened the door panel of this fridge. The design layout which we saw in the advertisement on Flipkart was different. We called up flipkart helpdesk and they arranged for technician visit from godrej. Seller and godrej both confirmed that the product and its model both are manufactured as per the design specifications and there is nothing that they can do. They were right on there part. It was Flipkart fault to post pictures which were miss leading. Later Flipkart did gave us an option to return the item however, we decided to keep the refrigerator as we got the same u through hefty discount offered on flipkart. Now we have got accustomed to the layout of fridge.",
