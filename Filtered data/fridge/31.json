            "Updating after one year of usage. The refrigerator is working very finely. Timely delivery from Flipkart. Got delivered on the same day which Flipkart promised. Since this product doesn't require installation, can be switched on after four hours as advised by the delivery agent.But still its advised to call Samsung toll free number and register the product. This will help in raising complaints during warranty period. Also once we register the product, Samsung representative will come and do the demonstration which will help us in asking any doubts or queries about the working.\n\nWorking:\n1. Excess ice formation in the freezer zone: Since this is a direct cool refrigerator, need to do manual defrosting at least once in a week which is basically pressing a switch which will in turn make the compressor stop working. This helps in removing the ice as the compressor wont work for at least 3 to 4 hours. This is little inconvenient. So be very sure if you want to go for a direct cool refrigerator or a frost free refrigerator. I was not very much aware about this when I got this product and now I did a mistake in buying a direct cool refrigerator.\n\n2. Water is getting accumulated in a tray at back side of the refrigerator. As per the users manual its written, this needs to be drained manually by taking out this tray frequently. This is a very tedious job and very inconvenient and if not done water is over flowing from the tray which will make the floor completely wet. This problem is severe during defrosting so be ready for this.\n\nSize is suitable only for a very small family, so be sure about the requirement when you go for this. Overall a good product at this price.",
            "Using it for 10 days now. Everything is good except there is a little vibration (which is normal in digital inverter compressor). If I put an empty bottle on top of fridge, sometimes it's vibrating. Side walls are getting hot, it's also normal. Cooling is excellent. Most of all the design is elegant and delivery boys are fantastic.",
            "Worth the price.\nA nice Samsung product.\nHas got a nice design and look. The back design gives it an upper hand. Cooling is good.... does its job in a quite fashion.\nInner trays and compartments are designed nicely. Absolutely no noise made. Right side gets bit warm - which is normal as per the manual provided and it's not a thing to even consider unless u hug ur refrigerator and sleep.\nThe power cord is bit short - only con that I have with this .... but not too short to consider buying a different product.\nRemoving the water collected after deforsting might be an issue... but doing that once in a while won't be a thing of concern.\nFilpkart - delivered the product fast and unscathed.",
