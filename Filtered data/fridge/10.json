            "Cons - 1. racks are fixed no additional racks are provided to adjust big utensils 2. only one egg try 3. freezer do not have LED light however it is mentioned in the product features 4. compressor area is open, LG has not provide any external cover for compressor 5.

I must say the over all quality of product is very good Over All Good Product for family of 2-3 persons, My Advice go for 290L plus if u have bigger family",
            "very nice and smart product by LG. it is what I had As expected and as seen the product online as it is. i just love it's look and smart features. I give 5 star for this Refrigerator as it runs very smoothly not a single sound from fridge very silent working, even firstly you will not get to know that its actually running. Flipkart delivery is on time but I have to wait complete 8days for it to received the product. Flipkart and LG brand packing was very good, so product don't have any single scratch on it. i got great discount as compare to shop and other website. I done installation by myself with help of provided LG guide and it's nothing great to do the installation and also you have not to wait for it. just only first you have to fix the place for your refrigerator in home and then you have to wait for at least 4-8 hours to get better result and have to run it for next 24 hrs with no loading of material in it. And still it's working in very good Condition, will see what happen in next coming days.",
            "delivered on time nice product. earlier had LG didn't had even single issue..even demo was good from LG...till now don't had any issue good product worth buying it.",
            "Delivery was spot on.. No hassle at all.. Kudos to flipkart for that... Fridge as such does not keep veggies as fresh as advertised.. There are better designs in market... I took it for linear Compressor tech... It d most silent fridge ever...",
            "As an Engineer my observation and review will be quite long.I have purchased the same fridge from Flipkart's main competitor last year.It was 4 star model that time.On the basis of my recommendation,my sister has decided to buy it from flipkart.\n\nCon-\n1.Very Stylish and good looking.\n2.Super quite performance.\n3.Power factor is near about 0.85\n4.Maximum time its runs on 30watt(min 10 watt, varies from 40-70) and 250 watt when it defrosts.For defrosting it takes appx.2 hr. and defrosting happens everyday.\n5.Unit consumption is almost 0.90 Kwh/day.( ~ 1 unit)\n6.Door open for long time - that sound is quite beneficial.\n7.Make sure your model has Ice beam Door cooling( pic attached)\n8.You can easily keep 2 L bottle on door shelf.Egg tray also there.22 eggs can be kept by adjusting properly.\n9.Shelf quality is very very good.\n10.Flipkart has delivered it on time.But installation was done by 3rd party vendor named Jeevs.Not directly by LG Technician.\n11.Despite of running 24*7,Fridge body doesnt get heated much.You will barely notice the sound of fridge except when it defrosts.\n12.Runs easily on inverter backup.\n\nDis-\n1.No adjustable rack,i.e u cant adjust shelf as ur need.Groove for shelf is fixed.\n2.No door open indication at freezer as well as no light.Only lower part has them both.\n\nI.hope those info will be beneficial.",

Flipkart and LG brand packing was very good, so product don't have any single scratch on it. i got great discount as compare to shop and other website. I done installation by myself with help of provided LG guide and it's nothing great to do the installation and also you have not to wait for it. just only first you have to fix the place for your refrigerator in home and then you have to wait for at least 4-8 hours to get better result and have to run it for next 24 hrs with no loading of material in it. And still it's working in very good Condition, will see what happen in next coming days.",
            "delivered on time nice product. earlier had LG didn't had even single issue..even demo was good from LG...till now don't had any issue good product worth buying it.",

            "As an Engineer my observation and review will be quite long.I have purchased the same fridge from Flipkart's main competitor last year.It was 4 star model that time.On the basis of my recommendation,my sister has decided to buy it from flipkart.\n\nCon-\n1.Very Stylish and good looking.\n2.Super quite performance.\n3.Power factor is near about 0.85\n4.Maximum time its runs on 30watt(min 10 watt, varies from 40-70) and 250 watt when it defrosts.For defrosting it takes appx.2 hr. and defrosting happens everyday.\n5.Unit consumption is almost 0.90 Kwh/day.( ~ 1 unit)\n6.Door open for long time - that sound is quite beneficial.\n7.Make sure your model has Ice beam Door cooling( pic attached)\n8.You can easily keep 2 L bottle on door shelf.Egg tray also there.22 eggs can be kept by adjusting properly.\n9.Shelf quality is very very good.\n10.Flipkart has delivered it on time.But installation was done by 3rd party vendor named Jeevs.Not directly by LG Technician.\n11.Despite of running 24*7,Fridge body doesnt get heated much.You will barely notice the sound of fridge except when it defrosts.\n12.Runs easily on inverter backup.\n\nDis-\n1.No adjustable rack,i.e u cant adjust shelf as ur need.Groove for shelf is fixed.\n2.No door open indication at freezer as well as no light.Only lower part has them both.\n\nI.hope those info will be beneficial.",

The installation was done just a few hours after delivery. installation guy helped with understanding of the features very well . Overall a good buy . would recommend this refrigerator for a family of 4-5 people .\nOne shortcoming which I found is the stand below the refrigerator is too small so I would recommend to buy a proper stand for the refrigerator",
            "LG 260 L Frost Free - Pretty cool refrigerator. Apt in size, looks, features, price & performance. Goes well with all needs of refrigerated stuffs.\nDouble Door. Top Door (no lights) for fast cooling (frost free) and does it with ease. Main door is spacious and free enough to store. Vegetable box has air lock safe. No stabiliser required. Not many refrigerator comes with handle for both the doors. All these makes this a perfect choice.\nAbove all got this at a cracking deal in Big Billion Sale (Oct 2016) of FLIPKART.",

            "Really great for a middle-class family. The freezer is very nice it's not convertible but i dont think a middle-class family will even need it. My mom is very happy with it using this from last 4 months haven't found any problem yet. If got will update in future. Suggestions for new buyers you guys can go for 300+ L version.",
            "Refrigerator is pretty nice , working well so far.\nAlthough delivery guy was late\nInstallation guy was very polite too.\nOverall, it was a nice deal.",
            "Flipkart has improved much since my last interaction and surprised me.So kudos to the FK team and thanks.\n\nComing to the product- looks steel shiny and fine.\nStorage capacity is 237 L ( Looks bulky for this storage capacity ), too much space for freezer eats up space for other racks , freezer has no light, racks are non-adjustable. I was expecting tray like storage just below fridge for potato onion ( for item requiring no cooling ) etc as in my single door fridge.Maybe my expectation was different for this size.\n\nFirst day the side panel was heating more ( bearable heat ) again not sure if that is normal for a fridge of this size. I will connect with LG if I feel uncomfortable.\n\nStar rating is 4 and LG claims 194* unit of annual power consumption.\n\nOverall I am not very much impressed.",
            "Performance and look is good but storage capacity is less. outer look is big but Inside the capacity is not equal to single door fridge... instead of buying double door better go for single door fridge... top door is only for freezer for home purpose this is not useful",
            "Feedback based on 2nd day of use of LG Refrigerator... Excellent Product... LG at its best always... Thanks Flipkart & the logistics partner E-Kart for the packaging & the prompt delivery...",
            "After using 4 months, I can say now \"Best refrigerator\" available right now in market, superb performance with silent operation, cooling is top notch, only 1 cons it has no light in freezer apart from that all thing is just awesome. Recommend to all \ud83d\ude0a",
            "This is a great product! Nice fridge with cool features and at remarkable price of great company !\nLook no further and buy this fridge! we are very happy with the price, quality and energy savings! this is a 4 star double door fridge!!!",
            "Got it for good price during sale period. Have been using it since last 2 months. Its working grt and not consuming much of energy. Best thing is that it works so silently that you won't even notice that you have a refrigerator at your home. The color also looks classy.",
            "The style of the product is good and power rating too. 4 star . The product is well spacious and is very calm while refrigeration Installation done and more then 7days still not yet Demo showing by engineer i would like to now when can do it ?",
            "The refrigerator arrived in good condition. We bought the item on exchange however, the old fridge was rejected by the pick up person. That was the only let down. Personally, felt there was too much nitpicking. Its an old fridge, bound to have cosmetic issues. The LG refrigerator is very good. Has good capacity and cools well. Happy with the purchase.",
            "Yes it\u2019s good and satisfied but the one things that would have been better was, the Flipkart policy is something that they will deliver the fridge only in the ground floor if you are in the first floor, then you need to take your own risk! So that was disappointing and rest the product the demo was all awesome and the same as I saw in the review! Then once the product is delivered, you will get s call from the dealer to get s stand for the fridge, that is as well a good sales! You need not order in Flipkart but the dealer will bring it home and will fix it for you!",
            "this is 2016 model bit of old people things but i wana tell u old is gold n this is pure gold plz buy i recommend to all..lg is the best producer of all refrigerator industries.",
            "Best refrigerator in this price band. Has lot of space as compared to other refrigerator of same size and price. It is 4 star and hence saves lot of electricity. It has ice beam cooling in freezer which makes it quite fast for freezing. Also it has door beam cooling due to which water bottles that are alongside door gets cooled easily. Perfect refrigerator for entry segment.",
            "Loved the build quality and finish, overall good cooling. But don't depend on Flipkart Installation services, it got cancelled after few days. You should call LG and register for demo on your own to avoid waiting for weeks and then cancellation of demo from Flipkart.\n\nI loved the fridge for everything, no need to think twice, go for it.",
            "Good Quality Product. Highly recommended.\nI have purchased this product in March 2021. It has good storage capacity with fast ice cooling. Sometimes when you close the fridge door you will get sound like water flowing but it's due to cooling. Overall it's good product for small family.",

            "Super quick delivery...In 18 hrs of placing order! Easy exchange. However, the delivery guys did not switch on the refrigerator and I was told that installation will happen on Monday. Of course I could not wait that long, called up LG Customer Care and they sent a technician in 2 hrs flat! Demo done, refrigerator started.\nAbout the refrigerator:\n1. Super silent. You need to open it to know it's running.\n2. Quick cooling\n3. Spacious, but not like Haier.\n4. A stunning looker. This was unexpected as I bought it looking at its pics on the Flipkart or LG website. I guess the computerised rendition of its picture does not do justice to its brushed steel look.\nCon: side walls are plane Jane plastic clad; so a side on view is not as stunning.",
            "Thank you flipkart to send me the amazing product.... Perfomence, quality, future wise LG is the Best.. But i have one concern inside the fridge one of the vegetables tray looks like old.. Its have scrach mark on it..overall i love the product......",

            "Have been using this refrigerator for 4 months now, good performance, no probs. Only this refrigerator cools very fast and sometimes is super chilled and too cold that you had to turn it off for a while, this is even in low mode. Guarantee on compressor for 10 years is awesome and the compressor works with inverter technology. Overall a quality product and good purchase.",
            "Couldn't be happier with the product and the delivery. Works perfectly even on the hottest days and is almost inaudible. Capacity is enough for a family of four if used in an organised way.

            "A damn good product at a very sweet price. Got with exchange plus cashback during Diwali sale. So it makes a very good price point for a 2016 product. Got the product in 4 days after order and got the exchange done without any hassle. Installation guy came the next day, though we already got the fridge setup by ourselves. He just explained the basic stuff.\n\nReview is after 2 days of usage.\n1. A premium looking product which pretty much blows you away with its looks. I was unsure about the shiny steel color, but it is just a beauty.\n2. The fridge has ample space for all your storage requirements (mine is a 6 member family).\n3. The cooling is pretty good and food is kept fresh. Hardly makes any noise and gives you peace of mind as the fridge is 4 star (194 units per year). Would have been perfect if it was a 5 star power rating.\n4. LED lighting is pretty cool and not sure why people complain about no light in freezer, I don't find that odd. It was not there in my previous godrej fridge either.\n5. Makes ice within an hour or so and twist mechanism to take it out is cool.\n6. I need to see if this brings down my EB bill next month.\n7. Haven't tried the inverter setup as I'm unsure to do it, though it says it will draw power of only 2 CFLs.\n8. Haven't tried the smart connect option either. Seems like a good tool to have it diagnosed.\n9. Didn't connect a stabilizer either as the fridge is said to work without stabilizer.\n\nOverall very happy with the product and service from Flipkart. Just go for it, you won't regret it.\n\nPS: A tip, Buying during a sale with exchange offer and cashback/flat discount on the card would give you the best deal.",
            "Nice product delivered as per schedule. Delivery person took my request for delivery change too. Installation was very prompt within 1 hour of delivery installation guys came and installed. Overall very happy with the service and delivery of Flipkart a big thumbs UP. Product is very good.",
            "Flipkart delivery is excellent. I ordered the product on 24th Oct and got delivered it by 25th Oct. The product came in excellent condition without any scratches. The installation also happened on the same day of the delivery. Need to monitor the performance for a week and give a feedback again.\n\nOne thing we have to make note is in the features of this product it was mentioned that coolpad is present for this model. But coolpad is not available for this product. I am already aware of that coolpad is not available for this product before buying the product. So make sure if you want a coolpad u have go for a different colour in the same variant. But other variants will cost Rs 4000/- extra for the color, coolpad and chiller tray. Flipkart should mention the appropriate features for all the products. I would recommend you go to a local shop see the models and then buy in flipkart.",

Right now can not give you feedback of this product... but one thing I should mention that is, please do not go with exchange offer... they accept only running product, no rust, no scratches on the body is acceptable to them just like a brand new product they want.....If the product is running good and there is no problem (like scratches or rust) on the body, why a customer should go to exchange the product. I think it is their (Flipkart) business policy to attract customer by showing the exchange offer on their website.

            "Usually good ratings are not given for late delivery but in my case am providing a 5 * rating just for the delayed delivery. Bcz that was all I required as I wanted to get the 20% cashback offer from citibank credit card as well as wanted delivery deliberately a month after from the current buying date.\nThe same item was available in the market for 3K more. So Am dividing my review in parts.\n1. Hats off to the seller personnel (Mr. Inder) for coordinating the delivery AFTER 1 MONTH OF buying the item. Dealing with such sellers seems so simple with their ready to help attitude. Superb!!!!!! KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.\n2. Dealing with Flipkart Customer care was a bit tricky with different and multiple calls regarding my request for delayed delivery. Also they were prompt to send me the person for installation within a day from delivery. Also a superb work from Team Flipkart.\n3. Where I was disappointed was that the delivery guys asked me a labour charge of Rs. 300 for carrying the item in the lift and unpacking. Though I handed those guys Rs. 50 (that is what I had at that time of the day in this era of demonetization) I would request the seller specially to educate the delivery guys not to ask for money in the name of labor charges and chae pani. This gives a bad name and affects the rating also.",
