Like the plastics and all.\nDelivery was okay for my area.\nThe color is grey but shiny and looks elegant. Fridge is good for 2 or 4 members family.\nIt's a 2 star fridge so electricity consumption is more than other fridges but price is less so no complain.\nI am writing this review after 2 days. Don't know about the durability. I'll update it after a long term use.",

            "This is the best deal i found for the reputed brand Refrigerator. Compressor comes with 10 years warranty. Its stabilizer free operation refrigerator. Silver colour looks classic and upmarket. Cools in no times. Thermostat setting at position 3 serves my purpose well in the month of June. Need to defrost 1-2 times in a week since ice formation happens due to power of the refrigerator and moisture in the room these days. Each and every thing looks well put together and made to last long. I highly recommend this refrigerator. Being 2 star, the electricity consumption compared to 5 star fridge is not much and will take at least 6 years to overcome extra price paid to purchase a 5 star refrigerator.",
