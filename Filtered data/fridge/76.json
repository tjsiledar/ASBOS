Thanks to the inverter Technology for the Compressor.\nThanks to Flipkart for timely delivery, Packaging was intact..Samsung Technicians service in starting the Refrigerator was also excellent.\nEven though separate stabiliser not required, I am using the old stabilise which was earlier used for 250 litres refrigerator.",
            "Impressive side by side refrigerator by Samsung. My review -\n1. Looks very elegant with a Matt finish.\n2. Huge space in both the fridge and the freezer side. The depth of the side bins are very good.\n3. The fridge functions almost noiseless.\n4. The temperature control panel is given inside, which is good thought as one doesn't need to keep changing it and it protects from accidental touch.\n5. There is also a door open alarm which is a good utility.\n6. The lights are bright.\n7. Due to the side bins, pulling out the vegetable trays require the door to be open 180 deg, though this is not too much of an inconvenience.\n8. The wire length is quite adequate to reach bottom or top plug point. It also does not require 15amp point making it convenient to be placed anywhere.\n\nFlipkart had put up a Try & Buy offer which helped make the decision to buy easy. Superb delivery by Flipkart without any issue to the product considering that this is a huge refrigerator.\n\nOverall Very satisfied with this purchase.",

By and large there are no issues in transportation and installation. People are nice and very helpful. As of now we are very pleased and happy with this product.",
