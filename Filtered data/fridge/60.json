            "Honestly i was very happy with this buy.. Its design and quality is good and performance also very good.. Before i buying this i had compared with this to samsung and heir but finally got best in this class. I surely recommend to new buyers without hesitation go for it..",
            "I m too much satisfied with whirlpool.... product is awesome design ..build quality.....and it's asthetic look each and every thing is mind blowing.....I prefer my all friends to go with whirlpool refrigerator....",
            "Awesome performance, perfect to the purpose.\nEverything described about this refrigerator is one hundred percent correct.\nLooks are awesom, even though nowadays LED lights are being used but this one has yellow light I am not sure if this is LED or not but as you can see in images the light increased the attractiveness.\nUser manual has nothing good for operation you have to dig a lot on internet to understand the modes and what type of cooling will be provided in which mode.\nYou can not identify what to do if you want manual cooling in upper and lower compartment.\nAfter searching a lot I have came to conclusion that the best mode for this refrigerator is ****Flexi Cool=Auto and Nob in refrigerator=Normal**** in this setting you can get icebox ready in approx 2.5Hrs.\nPlease note you can not run this refrigerator in highest mode i.e. nob=deep freez and flexi cool=high for more than 4 hrs.\nIf someone can help me with ( which setting I do require for high cooling in lower compartment and normal cooling in freezer compartment) I will really appreciate it.",
            "This is one of the best Refrigerator which I have received. Thank you Flipkart for keeping this Refrigerator in your Catalog. After researching in Internet, came to know that this is the best refrigerator of the year and very happy to see the design and the cool temperature of this product \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00",
            "\" Whirlpool is Whirlpool\" in a fridge segment. Everyways it's better than any other brands as per my personal view.\n\nPerformance: Though I am using this model for 3 days. But I tried every types of checking. It's making ice in 45 mints in normal/ auto mode. Making icecream in 2.5 hours in Deep freezer mode. Vegetables are fresh and milk are not damaged even after 8 hours of electric cut off.\n\nElectric Consumption: 190 unit per year as written in the fridge, but still I am not sure as I didn't check it with proper checking but honestly it is consuming very lesser than the previous 3 star fridge.\n\nDesign: In design it's spacious. But I need more options like covered bread space inside. And bottle holders and small Vegetables like lemon , chilly holder inside vegetable bucket were missing as I saw in the same model's fridge in others house. Don't know why these are jot there. It's 5.4 ft in hight.\n\nDelivery: Delivery was smooth. Delivery person was using every possible options to make the delivery Hygienic and better.\n\nInstallation & Demo: I had to face a lot of issue in demo & installation. I called several times to flipkart CC and whirlpool cc. But didn't get much solutions. Then I get to contact with local Area managers of whirlpool and he personally get this issue resolved. But Demo is not fully convincing.\n\nOverall: Overall it's a good product. You can obviously go for this. A lot of person can tell that thus one is not fully convertible as like samsung one but I am assuring that u will get an option of convert the frizer to fridge if u are not required of ice. Or more chilling. But u cannot keep vegetables in converted frizer then also. And u can go for 5 convertible mode in this fridge, where the temperature is preset. But in Samsung u have to set the temperature as well. So if u are having less technical persons in family then u should opt for Whirlpool one as it is not confusing. So if u are opting for this u will have happiness !!!!\n\nGo for this.",
            "The refrigerator is very awesome.It has a good space and a nice cooling..color looks attractive.design is attractive.fast cooling.the sound of compressor is very low.overall it is cool product.should buy it...The delivery was very fast and installation was done in 2 hrs..",
            "Whirlpool refrigerator is the best in its segment no doubt. I just worry about its delivery to my home. Now I feel very happy and relaxed after safest and successful home delivery. Product reached at my home without a single scratch. It's packing was excellent . Thank you Flipkart for your extraordinary and unbelievable services.",
            "Awesome looking refrigerator and Magnum Steel is a classy one if you are confused with colours. The cooling is optimum and soothing. The automatic all season mode takes care of all the hassles of adjusting the refrigerator cooling based on seasonal changes and lot more. The space management is descent and it easily holds a lot of food items. Whirlpool is a nice brand which provides amazing Fastrack services and Installation was blazing fast. The controls are easy and in fact lot more easier than any conventional ones. Highly recommended!",
            "It's Whirlpool after all. No comments!!! The refrigerator has excellent depth to store stuff, neatly planned and efficient in cooling. The black color adds an extra aura of exclusivity, loved and appreciated by many. Thank you Flipkart for having such wonderful products in your platform.",
            "The best for the price!\n\nIt is the lowest power consuming fridge in 340 l category only 207 units per year according to BEE certification\n\nBut It is not convertible , the company has just given some useless features along with it like chef , desert,party,all season,deep freezer modes.\n\nBut I wasn't looking for a convertible , I was looking for the most space,stars and value for money and I came across this product\n\nI would highly recommend you to buy the fridge if you are looking for a non convertible fridge \ud83d\ude0a",

            "Yes, it is a great refrigerator and excellent performance, convertible options work after 2 hour when you change it as their agent told us.\nWhirlpool is very careful about their product their services are good and they did good conversation Whirlpool is very careful about their products Their services are great it was great experience.\n\nBut slight disappointed is that their is no small basket inside vegitable box as shown in images in flipkart reviews and reviews on YouTube.",

Performance wise its worth for the money.",

Did not start.\nThe installation team was very unhygienic, without mask/ gloves, leaning all over the house.\nDid not have much clue about their job.\nHave asked for a replacement.\nLet's see how worse it gets.\nDisappointed by Flipkart & Whirlpool which I've used previously for 10 odd years.\n\n\nAnother review post replacement of product.\n\nIt was replaced fine & in time....but , this time the product is damaged from inside (shelves hooks broken, shelves damaged) looks previously used & still is not providing cooling.\nFlipkart seems to back to its old days of providing damaged stuff, like few years back.\nDisappointed.",

In the freezer their are three mode Medium freeze, normal and deep freeze. By using normal mode you can maintain same temperature in freezer and refrigerator, that means you can store the same things into the freezer as you store in refrigerator (its my observation). Over all good fridge as far as storage and looks concerned. Delivery has done in two days and installation on the same day.

The Fridge was delivered within 3 days of order and the Whirlpool technician came the same day for installation. Quite impressive service from Flipkart and Whirlpool so far.\nNow lets talk about the Fridge. I got the Fridge just as it was displayed. This one is quite big(292 Lt), big enough for my family of 4 and half(counting my daughter of 6 as a half :)).\nSome how I feel the vegetable basket could have been bigger. Compared to other brand in the similar range, I think this basket is bit small.\nThe Fridge comes with inbuilt stabilizer. Yet the Whirlpool technician insisted me to get one whirlpool external stabilizer for protection of the motherboard of this Fridge. As I am staying in Bangalore and power cut is quite frequent here, having the stabilizer could be good for my Fridge.",
