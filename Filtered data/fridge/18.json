            "Excellent .... Awesome at this price ....I bought at lowest price quick delivery . Like it . Go for it",
            "Great buy !! Look quality emerging is perfect... Kind of power consuming but better than my old singledoor fridge. . My mom is happy with this... Approximately 200-300 INR saved per month ... Still I was expecting more ...Fine for 2* current ratting",
            "Let me tell you the pros and cons of the refrigerator and basis which you can decide on your own about the requirements.\n\nPros:\n1. If your family is big and there are frequent open/close activity throughout the day then this is the best one as it is had high cooling power.\n2. Good freezer with high performance and defrost option.\n3. The design and product look is astonishing which is one of the highlights of whirlpool.\n\nCons:\n1. Just like cooling is a boon, I am facing it as a curse. Due to excessive cooling(even after keeping at minimum level), vegetables are getting perished easily.\n2. The freezer door doesn't have a light option like the lower deck and also the freezer is occuping too much of space which is required only for commercial purpose and not for home.\n3. Refrigerator comes with 2 star rating which results in excess power consumption.\n\nPs: this is my personal opinion for my limited usage and small family.",
            "Good deal with flipkart alwayz happy my mom also like it and delivery was also fast with second day instalation good service from flipkart and wirpool thanks you so much",
            "Very good product. I have purchased the fridge 10 days back only. Till now no problem. Electricity conception I have to wait for next electricity bill. Appearance is very good. Noice free working. Build quality is very good. Flipcart packing and delivery was very prompt. Proper follow up from Flipcart. Overall excellent.",
            "nice product ..... good cooling and space...... material quality is superb than other good brands like lG, godrej and Samsung.....No dent on body it was completely wrapped safely.",
            "It is a good refrigerator w.r.t price. Design & capacity are good. There is no requirement of installation & demo. Freezer capacity should be less, so we will get more storage space. It has 2 Star, so power consumption is little bit more. Important thing is no need of refrigerator stand for this, if you want you can use.",
            "GREAT PRODUCT... SUCH A NICE SERVICE.. LIKED THE PRODUCT VERY MUCH... ITS TOO GOOD IN THIS COST AS COMPARED TO MARKET PRICE",
            "Product is well performance....nice color . Worth for money ... Whirlpool is best refrigerator company..I exchange my old Whirlpool single door fridge to new double door fridge .... 1800 exchange product price.. .. thanks flipkart thanks Whirlpool...\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc90\ud83d\udc90\ud83d\udc90\u263a\ufe0f\u263a\ufe0f\u263a\ufe0f",
            "To the point I will say, this is really a good product. I was very confused between Samsung and whirlpool as they both are the best in there jobs. But,to be honest! I have been using the whirlpool from last 18 years and the fridge is still in good condition and that's why I wanted to continue with them. And this is a value for money. On time deliver by Flipkart and on next day only demo has been shown. Overall satisfied\ud83d\ude00",
            "Prompt delivery from Flipkart. I ordered the product on Tuesday and got it delivered next day. Plus, excellent customer care service from Whirlpool. Once the fridge was delivered, I called up the Whirlpool customer care. Within the next 30 minutes, a technician came to my house for demo and installation. Overall, very good experience.\nThe fridge is working fine and is ideal for small households / bachelors.",
            "The packaging and demo was good. The fridge cools fast and is good for quick chilling. Got a good bargain on exchange of my old fridge as well",
            "Fast delivery(exchange process) from Flipcart - 5/5. Sameday installation by whirlpool (the installation guy's behaviour was good but he tried to cross sell whirlpool inverters stating the fridge doesnot have in-built one. Later I verified at whirlpool website where it is stated the in-built inverter in this model) - 4/5. Performance : bought 10 days back. Inside cooling/freezing is fine till now. Sometimes outer panel on the right would be super hot as mentioned in other reviews. Whirlpool customer care mentioned it is normal to heat up 45\u00b0C - 3.5/5 (Yet to check electricity bill on power saving). Pricing: excellent with exchange deal 5/5. Overall: Happy with the purchase (till now)",

            "The double cabinet fridge, offers adequate space to store food for a nuclear family, since the upper cabinet, is big enough to kill meaningful space, and thus makes the lower compartment, somewhat squeezed, as compared to single door fridges. There is no light in the upper cabinet. There is no frost or fogg. Flipkart ,managed to deliver, within 4 days, to my Kolkata address, and the very next day, the installation man, from whirlpool, came running around. The whirlpool office, were adamant in my buying of a install PVC stand, and deodorizer@200/ exclusively from whirlpool, otherwise they would decline the promised warranty.",
            "More than the fridge, the instant delivery and the very next day installation as per scheduled time impressed me. The fridge is just 3-4 days old and is performing well.
