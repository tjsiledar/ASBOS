            "First of all thanks to Flipkart for their two day safe delivery. I received the product with not even a single scratch.\nComing to the product , it's spacious and suitable for a family with 5-6 members. Two separate motors for freezer and refrigerator made me impressed. Samsung's unique 5in1 convertible technology is pretty useful.\nThere are two side racks in the freezer also in which we can keep small items such as Chocolates , nail polishes etc.. Freezer space is also huge.Deodorizing filter made of natural fibre helps the smell inside the refrigerator to get out. There are four toughened glass shelves and a big Vegetables basket at the bottom.\nThere is only one bottle guard which will accommodate just 5 bottles which is a little bit uncomfortable. However we can keep the bottles in the shelves and even in the freezer. The cooling controls are very simple to operate.\nOver all the refrigerator is in perfect working condition . If you are looking for the extra space , without a doubt go for it.",
            "The refrigerator is according to our needs, 5in 1 convertible option is very useful, it consumes less power, during power-cut works for nearly an hour with a single battery UPS, doesn't have light in the freezer compartment, no extra fruit box or dual veg box, compartments in the refrigerator are as in the image. No lock available. No wheels are available in the base. The color looks elegant & classy. Only the front portion is of elegant Inox with classy finish , the 2sides are of different material (fibre).",
            "Got my 253 ltr refrigerator exactly within 3 days safe and swift delivery by Ekart. Demonstration done next day nicely by Samsung Service engineer. Wonderful, premium look and very silent refrigerator with 3 in 1 convertible inverter technology. Really love it thanks Flipkart.",
            "A must buy, if you need a bigger sized fridge. Optimal space design. Bottle holder at door are sufficiently wide and tall to hold 2.25L cold drink bottle, juice cartoon, milk cartoon, etc. The ice tray and storage box comes as a independent unit, which upon need can be removes from the freezer to increase the storage space. Similarly a tray halves the freezer into two, which is also removable.\nLed lighting inside the fridge, tempered glass shelves.\nI definitely recommend this product.\nFlipkart delivered it on promised time and with outmost care. But they should lower the delivery time significantly. Upon ordering, the seller didn't ship for approximately 10 days, then the travel time was around 4-5 days. Hence it would be much convenient for a customer if flipkart could deliver the large products at a time window of 4-5 days rather than setting idle for 15 days.",

            "The best in the lot for refrigerators is Samsung right now! Very dependable performance. For the design, I would say that I'm a bit disappointed with the third tray, as its too narrow... Overall, a very good refrigerator. Packing was absolutely top class. The courier partners unfortunately, delayed the delivery, which led to a minor hiccup. Eyes closed, u can trust brand Samsung in refrigerators.",

            "Reviewing after 3 months of usage.\nOverall a great fridge with great features and very low power consumption. Installation service is fast and smooth.\nDeducting 1 star for being a bit noisy...",
            "I bought 324 litre one. The space is more sufficient when compared to our old godrej single door refrigerator of 190 litre. Design is spectacular when compared to other brand double door refrigerator. One more handy feature is ice cube box can be removed and can be used whenever necessary which is making lot of room in freezer. Finally the convertible feature is awesome. Got it in a good deal around 27K by exchanging old single door refrigerator for 3K and bank discount.",
            "Super Awesome Product. Super Awesome Packaging. Super Awesome Delivery.\nInstallation guy was horrible but come on ! who cares about installation guys. \ud83e\udd23 It's a fridge. Flipkart killed it with super safe lockdown time delivery. Always go for this refrigerator. Its been 8 months and the product runs like cheese.",
            "hats off to delivery team, on time , no scratch ...\nfridge is superb , low power consumption, very specious , inverter backup works very well , very stylish ,\ni am happy",
            "Wanted a convertible model as It can add up space when needed and finalised on samsung and lg after a lot of research all the guns were pointed towards LG for their stronghold in the field of electronics and also the after sales support but a little scifi look and design made me go for samsung!:-p. And I have no regrets till date with the decision I have made. Waited for the power bill to post this review and the refrigerator scored well in that field too. The power consumption is minimal. Freezer has no light but it was never a problem for me. The main thing I liked about it was the silent functionality and the control system which is external that you don't need to open the refrigerator to change any control. The led inside is cool! The glass shelves are considerably strong as mentioned. Removable ice maker is great. 2 big shelves are given for the eggs which are of no use to me as I don't feel it a good idea to place the eggs in the refrigerator which are mostly content with salmonella and many other bacteria!\nThe installation was also smooth but only thing I didn't like was the delivery as the delivery is extremely rough and had a minor dent on the back of refrigerator but decided to live on with it as performance isn't affected and its mostly invisible. Overall a great buy.",
            "This is really an amazing product. I had a fixed space and was doubting whether it fits it but, went with a gut feel as I was need in of 300+ litre capacity fridge and finally, extremely satisfied and very happy about the purchase.\n\nBooked on Saturday night, arrived on Monday evening and installation from Samsung got finished by Tuesday morning.\n\nThis fridge has all the features mentioned, scratch and dent free, and wondered to get a really a very fresh piece as I had noticed the manufacturing month and year is the same month I had purchased.\n\nI will definitely recommend this exciting choice when you are looking for 300+ litre capacity with all latest features and height under 161 cm (163 cm is the height of the door and it doesn't impact my fixed space).\n\nMany thanks to the seller and keep rocking !",
            "1. It fits for 4 to 5 members of a family\n2. Freezer works awesome you have option power freeze\n3. U can convert freezer to fridge and vice versa within 3 seconds\n4. Very user friendly operations\n5. Eventhough don't have all. Fancy stuff intelligent cooling and all which is not required jut to say fancy terms, I Feel this will stand for 10 years with market competion\n6. I did not find any sound with the machine unlike other barnds\n\nI can say best buy!",
            "The product is good but installation and demo by flipkart jeevas is not good they are not kno2 to how to operate this refrigerator and how to do in convertible mode.Try to buy this from amazpn as their demo is good and better than flipkart",
            "Looks very good. The color also looks really sophisticated. Got the 275 litre capacity one. Just got the delivery today and have been using it for half a day. Will update the review with more usage.\n\nBest part of the experience: Super fast delivery in 1 day by Flipkart. Even super duper fast installation by Jeeves technician.\n\nGot an exchange done and everything went flawless.",
            "This is an excellent product with value for money. Its crisp design improves the ambience and aesthetic of the kitchen.\nIt has awesome features and the cooling is top notch.\nHighly recommended for a budget buy.",
            "No adjustments of door side tray ,like LG fridge.\nFreezer is big & not Fridge.Need more space in Freeze & not in freezer.\nCompany like samsung must make product which is user friendly.Focus on tray adjustment which give more flexibility for storage.\nI want another fridge for my native place, but now I will go for fridge which give flexibility in storage & more space in Freeze.",
            "Very fast and reliable delivery by Flipkart.\n\nBut the delivery van person was a little bit irresponsible..\nWas driving fast and many items were overturned in the delivery van.\n\nI request flipkart to adopt better logistics and good quality vans.",
            "Wonderful product value for money and they have delivered with very careful precautions. Fridge is fine for 6 member family and definitely the 5 in 1 feature is awesome I will use it accordingly.",
            "It's a very nice refrigerator and I got it in the big billion days sale at very competitive price as what is available now or in the market",
            "Very good service As well as very good product, worth buying it...",
            "Very nice product...5 in one convertible. You can adjust temperature. Vegetables stay fresh for longer time compared to other refrigerators. Good storage space inside. Must buy if the price range is around 30k",
            "Veryy nice ....we have self installated..the refrigerator..and it's very nice and in good condition...\nBut I was upset that ..there is less features in 5 in 1 convertible refrigerator..in less capacity model....in 253 L we don't get all features as 375 L model...even though it's said that it's 5 in 1 convertible refrigerator.\nSo. Do check picture s of the model which you require.. other wise the product is fabulous",
            "Really good product and thank you flipkart today delivery and today installation. Thank you samsung and thank you flipkart",
            "Good product @22k. 2 days delivery and same day installation. Cooling z really good with air flow tech which keeps vegies as fresh as farm. Plastic color n quality if improved, will feel premium. Freezer works excellent no excess ice / moisture in refrigerator. Overall 4/5 for product and 5/5 to fk for del and installation.",
            "This refrigerator was very good quality and good working. The size was big also, Delivered and installation person was very good means manually bring down from the vehicle carefully.After 3 days installation and demo was very good. Thanks Flipkart.",
            "First I thanks to Flipkart for making one day delivery and excellent service and also the product from Samsung is very good this is nice for the family above 4 peoples we can make dual fridge to store more things in our fridge and Frost free technology also very nice totally this product this worth full form money and cooling also very nice...",
            "Good cooling capacity but the super freezing mode does not freeez as fast as advertised. But good enough to achieve below - 10 deg. The storage shelved design is not that good. The storage is very deep and creates problems when finding things kept behind. A wider but less deep design would have been better.",
            "Ordered something from flipkart after 4 years. It was worth it. The delivery and demonstration was done as expected. Too early to say about the performance and durability but so far I like the refrigerator, giving temprature setting penal outside in this range is good add on.",
            "Not good for a family of more than 2 people\n\nBottle holder are small in size and so you have to keep bottles inside cabinet rather than on the door.\nHeight is also small\nPoor design on the door cabinet\n\n\nPerformance is good\nI would say go for bigger size in case choosing same model",
            "Samsung do the wonderful job. Very nice product. Awesome delivery by flipkart. Flipkart is the best.",
            "Selected Samsung 324ltr with Coolpad option...bt after technician visited & checked..there was no Coolpad option available in refrigerator so wt actually reason behind it ,it was wrong model delivered by Flipkart...how such a big named like Flipkart can do this kind of mistake... although they refunded my all money ...bt suggest to all ,plz check in detail if any product purchased from flipkart",
            "Very bad experience as installation and demo was not done on given time..",
            "Great model with inverter technology technology + convertible .Go for it.",
            "physical damaged piece supplied don't purchase from Flipkart",
            "Very Good refrigerator from Flipkart..\nSamsung\u2764\ufe0f",
            "Do not buy such big appliances online ,retuning product due transit damage is a nightmare. Better buy it from local shop there you don't have to worry about such things. Flipkart return policy is not up to the mark.",
            "This is not a review for the seller, but for Flipkart.\n\nThe first refrigerator delivered had a dent smack in the center of the door! Handling was obviously the issue as the packaging had a gaping hole through it.\nThey still delivered it!! I promptly requested a return, which they did indeed process promptly.\n\nReplacement was delivered 4 days later, with a promise of installation within 48 hours. Its been 15 days since delivery and no one has shown up for the installation yet!!\n\nI have sent multiple followups and made many calls. They keep throwing dates at me. We will get it done ASAP, surely by the 11th, oh sorry - will do it for sure by 12th...., and still no one has shown up!!\n\nDear Flipkart, You need to get your act together. This is terrible service. No one is even responding properly to my messages. Customer Service execs are all confused, stepping on each others updates.\n\nNow, I will wait to see if this review changes things... not too hopeful though.\n\n\nUpdate:\nNo one from Flipkart contacted us. When we called the helpline again the agent nonchalantly said \"its just a refrigerator, just plug it in - should work\".\nSeriously?!! What kind of training do they go through?\nWhen asked if that would void our warranty he just cut the call...The next person promptly dismissed it as a mistake and requested us to wait for the installation ..\n\nIts been 17 days since delivery... No one is even responding to my emails!! How is this acceptable?",
            "Super quick delivery by Flipkart. The product is excellent and value for money.",
            "Product is excellent..Go for it.. Premium look provide.. Excellent cooling I got at 25990 value for money.",
            "Dent on the refrigerator door",
            "The product is okay but the installation is the worst I've ever seen. The technician knew nothing about the product. Even with on call assistance, they could not even answer the basic features of the product. On top of that, they insisted on having an external stabiliser while the refrigerator has an inbuilt stabiliser already. It started turning off and on randomly because of this!\nTotally disappointed with the installation done by the Flipkart installation team. Never recommend anyone buying a refrigerator from Flipkart!",
            "Cooling issue within one week of use\nFreezer looks fine but refrigeration is worst\ncalled customertomer care many times but still after 48 hours issue did not got resolved",
            "Waiting for demo installation last for days...",
            "Royal look with very effective and efficient compressor\n\nIt's been running on my inverter too\n\nNo noise.. No smell\n\nTooks a little time too freeze but it can be mangeble when it takes Only 120 Watts\n\nVery nice",

            "Excellent product",
            "I am using Samsung freeze since last 10-15 years. I took Samsung's fridge in 2021 and I got to see many problems in it within just 1 month. As if the gate did not open due to the internal pressure in the fridge. The sound of forest water in the frizer like throw a bottle water very discusting",
            "Thanks flipkart",
            "Worst product within one month of usage compressor and circuit was damaged.There is no replacement of this product as it has crossed 20 days and repair of the parts is taking more than 6 days. Worst experience from Samsung and flipkart for delivering faulty products. Recommend not to buy this product.",
            "Very good refrigerator, but as all have said it is zero noise ref. But my refrigerator makes some noise, otherwise it is very best for a family of four (260 l) done using for 15 days , no problem at all. Buy this refrigerator without any hesitation.Space is also great and ofcourse received without a single scratch or dent.",
            "I found everything perfect except the fact that the above freezer doesn't have a light. I just failed to digest this that they did not placed a light, so, during night time it's almost impossible to take anything from top freezer like ice cream and all without turning on the kitchen light.",
            "I found damaged product...I sand lots of complents but company always ignores my complaint. Company has no good seller and also no good customar care team. Very sad",
            "Good product",
            "It's been just 2 days of usage and initial reaction is positive. As the refrigerator does its job. Please find my views below.\n\n# I Bought a 275 liter 3 star with 3in1 convertible option and as per the rating it is expected to consume 199 units of power in a year.\n\n#Delivery was prompt and there was no damage at all. Not even a single scratch so felt happy. Initially was a bit worried about damage happening during transit.\n\n# Refrigerator is silent and have not faced any heating issues as I have set temperature at -19/-3 initially.\n\n#Trays provided are tough and durable material so no need to worry about storing heavy items.\n\n#Installation was fast as it was done the next day itself.\n\n\nWill post a detailed review after 2 months of usage.",

The delivery guys are very decent but the thing is it's a heavy item and that leads to scratches and dent on the body.\nThe first fridge that i received had a dent and it got replaced without any trouble but the second one which i received is still having dent on one side and it is also an old model.\nBut as i said how many times will u shift this heavy product and exchange it, so i would advice to go and buy things like refrigerator from a shop. From my experience, i would never go for shopping such heavy products online again because everytime i am receiving a product having some dents or bumps and after paying such huge amount it is not okay to settle with a product having dent\nSo a wise decision would be to buy this kind of products from market rather than online",
            "Happy with the product but totally annoyed with the exchange policy. My old fridge is in perfect working condition but the delivery guy flatly refused to take it just for a dent the size of a nail tip, which isn't even visible if you don't look carefully. If they give the exchange policy then obviously some wear and tear in the old product is to be expected.",

Decent delivery experience from Flipkart.\n2. The product build quality is quite good and looks modern and aesthetic.\n3. The functioning and cooling is also good.\n4. The lower tray can be adjusted up or down depending on the height of the vessels. (Mother's requirement)\n5. Enough capacity for a family of 5 members.\n6. No need for stabilizer as mentioned on the fridge.\n7. Flushed handle means no projections or sharp corners.\n8. Easy controls on the door to increase or decrease the freezer and fridge temperature.\n9. Easy to change using the convertible mode on the fridge (just long press the button).\n\nCons:\n1. No light in the freezer. (Most brands don't have it)\n2. Easy slide tray is nice but height cannot be adjusted.\n2. Tall bottle compartment on the door should have detachable option. As we don't use tall bottles and the space is wasted.",
            "Good product",
            "Very good",

            "Loved it",
            "Delivery happened in less than 12 hrs from placing the order. Product was in pristine condition. Installation happened the very next day.\nComing to product, have been using it for more than a month now and there are no complaints. The compressor may not be as quiet as the LG ones but it doesn't bothers. The door storage could have been optimized better by giving another narrow rack at the bottom by reducing the size of veg basket (which is very very big and remains underutilized). Cooling is very effective; ice maker is good. A chill tray above the topmost rack would have been a really useful feature, maybe they removed for cutting cost. Have not used the convertible feature yet but I already knew it's more of a marketing gimmick than something really useful - no one really cares about switching various portions of the same fridge on & off!",

Refrigerator is quite big and ensure that you are not the only person to open it up, else you may damage the new piece. The refrigerator is advised to be started after at least 4 hours of delivery.\nComing to product review, look wise the Samsung 275L Digital Inverter Convertible refrigerator is very nice. LED light provided in fridge compartment works great. Unfortunately, no lights in Freezer compartment. Samsung should update this. Once it is ON, the side walls and upper wall of fridge will start heating up (but not at extreme level). It is manufactured that way to maximize the exhaustion. This is normal. Cooling effect is good in both the compartments. It is spacious and you can store many items in there. It's a value for money product. I would say Go for it.",

            "Update #1: 21-Jan-2021 (3 months of purchase)\nThis refrigerator has a serious water leakage issue. There is a tray behind the refrigerator that collects water and uses a coil to evaporate it. This is how frost-free refrigerators work. However, this refrigerator has a manufacturing defect that in slightly humid conditions, the tray fills up and you are left mopping your floor everyday. Since the tray is also locked and hidden away, you cannot discard the water as you would do in your old school manual defrost refrigerators. The reason I am confident of a manufacturer quality issue is because this refrigerator was replaced by Samsung 1.5 months ago for me with a brand new unit due to this same reason. The second unit also developed the same issue within 15 days of use. I am fighting with Samsung and the service center to resolve the issue. But please buy this with great discretion. Removed 2 stars.\n\nUpdate #2: 08-Feb-2021 (4 months of purchase)\nSamsung refuses to give a cash refund. They only give you limited use vouchers that you can redeem online or in-store in SAMSUNG STORES AND WEBSITE ONLY. The voucher is for the final no-cost EMI price you have paid from your card. So you are left with EMIs for the existing refrigerator, GST loss, any extended warranty loss and finally being forced to purchase a new refrigerator at extremely inflated prices in their outlets. Despite having purchased numerous products from Samsung, I have been left at a financial loss and mental agony.\n\nOriginal Review:\nA very dashing and contemporary looking refrigerator. The refrigerator is quite spacious and trays run deep. The 275L is about 5.5 feet tall without stand. Just the right size for people switching from single door 195L models like me. I chose the size considering that I need about 175L of storage without converting freezer to fridge in hot summers. However, Convertible mode works very well in extending storage space as advertised. Solidly built with no wobbling at all. Matte finish so fingerprints are less visible. No major heating concerns. Totally happy with Flipkart delivery and installation experience.\nIf anything, the bottle tray for large bottles is provided on top rather than bottom. The tray is too wide -perfect fit for those 2L soft drinks. But we don't use soft drinks so our usual 1L water bottles tend to wobble or tilt when we open the door too fast.",
            "Good product, less energy consuming, value for money, got from Flipkart without any damage",
            "Excellent product... \ud83d\ude0a",

            "It's a nice refrigerator. The convertible feature is quite good and it save lots of space in winter when freezer is not used frequently. I got it a price of Rs 24.5k. Don't think just go for it, you will not regret your decision.",

            "Awesome service by flipkart. Installation was also very fast. Fine Design and feature loaded",
            "Writing this review after 1 week of usage. At first delivery and installation happened very fast. Installation happened the very next day of delivery. Cooling is very good and it has 3 different modes which is very useful. Power freeze to freeze within short span of time, power cool to increase the chillness of fridge if we have high volume within short span of time and Convertible which takes around 2 hours to completely convert to fridge. Freezer compartment is very effective that it freezes the ice cubes within 15 mins. Frost free is very helpful because I have been using old refrigerator which frosts quite often.

            "This product in its 2013 avatar was bought by us in our home town Bhubaneswar. The 2020 variant is the same thing but with 2 excellent additions.\n1. The fridge despite being rated 3 Star is actually a 5 star from 2018. This is because of new rule changes of BES that makes 4/5 star rating for such a big fridge impossible. So the consumption is only 224 units per year.\n2. Now the other advantage is this fridge is a convertible model where you can change the Freezer between Freezer, Fridge or just a Storage space. And the bottom fridge can switch between being a fridge or just a storage rack. Now this will be beneficial if you are going out for vacations or at home alone with less requirement of fridge. Thereby, saving you some bucks on energy bill.\n\nI had a problem with the first fridge I received but it was returned and replaced by Flipkart, although it took some time due to the COVID-19 crisis.",
