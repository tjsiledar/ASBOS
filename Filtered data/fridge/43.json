            "Using since 3 months.. Very good product. Value for money.. Good for family of 3-4 members. Bottom freezer refrigerators helps a lot when you use less of deep freezer in your day to day routine & more of normal freezer.. This usually helps for older people where they need not always bend down to look what's there inside fridge .. And even the 8 modes of controlling the cooling conditions inside the fridge helps a lot...Installation and response from Haier team is good and quick.. Thanks to flipkart for on time delivery! 5 stars for everything!\nNote : Review is not given for commercial purpose.. Consider this as genuine review ! Thanks!",
            "Very much happy with my purchase. It has enough space for a family of 4-5. The bottom mount design is really innovative and helps the elderly from not bending much. I trust Haier and hope it stays with us for years.. \ud83d\ude00\ud83e\udd1e",

            "Excellent refrigerator, great value for money\n\n+ Great ergonomics thanks to the bottom mounted freezer\n+ The convertible aspect is very useful. Converted the freezer to a fridge, and turned off the fridge section for vacation and it worked really well.\n+ Fridge section temperature is maintained very well. Even when hot objects are placed in fridge they are cooled very quickly.\n+ Big bottle section on door is quite useful for bigger juice bottles and cartons.\n+ Has wheels at the rear making it easy to tilt and move\n\n- 3 Star Energy rating\n- Liquids in fridge section (usually milk) freezes on cold nights (when the room/ambient temperature drops to around 10-12\u00baC)",
            "We have been using this refrigerator for past 2 months now. I think this is spacious enough for a four member family. Power consumption considerably reduced after this purchase. The delivery and installation service was appreciable. I don't know a lot about the technical side of this refrigerator. But we really loved this purchase.

            "Using since 3 months.. Very good product. Value for money.. Good for family of 3-4 members. Bottom freezer refrigerators helps a lot when you use less of deep freezer in your day to day routine & more of normal freezer.. This usually helps for older people where they need not always bend down to look what's there inside fridge .. And even the 8 modes of controlling the cooling conditions inside the fridge helps a lot...Installation and response from Haier team is good and quick.. Thanks to flipkart for on time delivery! 5 stars for everything!\nNote : Review is not given for commercial purpose.. Consider this as genuine review ! Thanks!",
            "Very much happy with my purchase. It has enough space for a family of 4-5. The bottom mount design is really innovative and helps the elderly from not bending much. I trust Haier and hope it stays with us for years.. \ud83d\ude00\ud83e\udd1e",

            "Excellent refrigerator, great value for money\n\n+ Great ergonomics thanks to the bottom mounted freezer\n+ The convertible aspect is very useful. Converted the freezer to a fridge, and turned off the fridge section for vacation and it worked really well.\n+ Fridge section temperature is maintained very well. Even when hot objects are placed in fridge they are cooled very quickly.\n+ Big bottle section on door is quite useful for bigger juice bottles and cartons.\n+ Has wheels at the rear making it easy to tilt and move\n\n- 3 Star Energy rating\n- Liquids in fridge section (usually milk) freezes on cold nights (when the room/ambient temperature drops to around 10-12\u00baC)",
            "We have been using this refrigerator for past 2 months now. I think this is spacious enough for a four member family. Power consumption considerably reduced after this purchase. The delivery and installation service was appreciable. I don't know a lot about the technical side of this refrigerator. But we really loved this purchase.
