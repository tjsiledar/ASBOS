WHEN I REACHED OUT TO THE WEBSITE FOR SUPPORT AND TYPED IN MY PINCODE ... IT IS SAYING NOT SERVICABLE LOCATION. IF YOU CAN SEND AND INSTALL THE PRODUCT HERE WHY CANT YOU RECTIFY IT. HOW WILL I TRUST THE BRAND ANYMORE . THIS IS REALLY A HORRIBLE NIGHTMARE. I CANT KEEP ANYTHING IN THE FRIDGE WITHOUT GETTING SPOILED OR FILLED WITH CONDESED WATER.\n\nANOTHER PROBLEM IS THAT THE DOOR WONT CLOSE THE MAGNETIC WASHER SURROUNDING THE DOOR IS NOT WORKING IN JUST 1 MONTH. THE COLD AIR CIRCULATING IS LEAKING OUT.I REQUEST CUSTOMERS NOT TO BUY THIS PRODUCT OR BRAND.",
