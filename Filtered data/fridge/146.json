            "It's an awesome refrigerator as per my family requirements. Got a good deal on Flipkart and delivery & installation was also super quick (within 24-hours of placing order I had my refrigerator delivered and working at my place).\n\nBut the Exchange offer of Flipkart is a BIG SCAM AKA TOTAL JHOL.. They want the existing product that we are using in BRAND NEW condition. Even if your product is properly working the delivery person will not approve the exchange. They have trained their delivery persons the best in disapproving the exchange.\n\nIf that existing product is in that brand new condition than why on Earth would I will willingly give it away to you at mere Rs. 1500-2000!!!!!!!! If one is using any product for more than a year or two obviously there will be some wear and tear after it's a machine and that is reason of giving it away at the negligible exchange value. But Flipkart doesn't consider it. They want new products in exchange.\n\nPutting efforts to write this review after multiple experience from Flipkart's Exchange Scam.\n\nIf Flipkart is that concerned it should also provide buy-back guarantee on the products purchased via them.",
            "Great product with good value for money. Demo guys visited on time. The biggest inconvenience was that the delivery guys did not drop the fridge at my doorstep! They instead asked me to come over to them further away from my home and pick it up from there as they were not willing to drive all the way to my house due to narrow roads. Well flipkart doesn't mention anything about narrow roads restriction in their delivery promise policy. Plus I have mini trucks accessing the area I live day and night!! It was frustrating but they left me with no options. So I drove all the way to them and then hired a local carriage guy to take the fridge home and obviously it was not for free. Very disappointing delivery service I have to say. Not happy. Nevertheless, I have placed another order from Flipkart and hope that they will follow the right protocol this time.",
            "Is a perfect fit for my house. I was looking for a compact fridge with depth as low as possible so that fits in my kitchen corner place. And it did perfectly even after leaving an inch gap at the back from the wall. Cooling capacity is very impressive. Only thing that I felt could be improved is the ice tray. Its fixed to the bottom container and is almost impossible to fill with water. But that doesnt make this a bad purchase decision. You can always get one extra ice tray as per your design preference. Installation was smooth as usual with Haier the very next day, the engineer who came for installation suggested to take up 3 year extended warranty on top of the first 1 year that the company is offering. This cost me 2550 rupees and is worth it I thought.\nOverall a perfect fridge for working couple who tend to store substantial groceries and items through the week.\nThe convertible feature is very handy when I am going out for extended period of time.",
            "Excellent product, Fast delivery from Flipkart Team.\nInstant Installation from Haier Service Team.\nCooling is excellent in the refrigerator, all the modes work properly and super freeze mode is works properly.\nPaint finish is excellent and aesthetically it look very good.\nvalue for money product from Haier as compared to other brands in market.",
