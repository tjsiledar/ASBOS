            "Looks good and performance was good but inbuilt stabilization is very poor. 4 parts were gone just in 6 months of purchase. Whirlpool customer service is one of the worst I have ever seen till today. Don't expect good service from company side. Refrigerator is good but use with stabilizer.",
            "Im writing this about half a year after purchase of the refrigerator as my ratings show it is very goid in this price range. Space is good enough for family of 7-10 people, in this one youll find more trays as i searched a lot before buying this and realised many variant have only 2 trays in this one we have 3 trays which is awesome. a special tray for fruits which is good. however this one little less wider than above 300 lts ones but good as it is taller. so my ratings are 5 star as in this price range and features you get for whirlphool like 6th sense cooling tech means it has auto function which can set based on room temp automatically which is ver good. if you have any doubt i would recommend to go for youtube about this ine and have a look on video that would give you better idea. also but from Flipkart the price they are offerring is way to good comparing with dealers if you go buy yourself. filpkart is very good they gave it to me intact on time delivery without any issues so 5 star to Flipkart fron me for this Whirlphool Regrigerator.",

            "Product Delivered on 25th April and taken back the old fridge as exchange. And they instructed that don't remove the cart or don't connect fridge to the power until the Technician's instruction. If we connect without technician's presence you will loose the warranty.\n\nUntil today i did not get any information from the whirlpool team if you call them they will not give you proper information. One of the executive said might be it will take more than 15 days. Even i checked with the flipkart they are also not taking this is serious issue. They are in the impression that once product delivered they are not responsible for anything.\n\nMy suggestion is better avoid purchase through flipkart especially these kind of products. You will get same product with same price from the outside shop (I enquired it and confirmed). So I am requesting you don' t invest money to make yourself fool.",
            "I brought this Refrigerator after doing a bit of research both online and visiting couple of showrooms. I had compared different brands within the same capacity for features / options they provide and got drill down to this! The auto features works well. The freezer section only do not have light. The delivery and installation was too hassel free. Rest all is fine. I am happy for this purchase.",
