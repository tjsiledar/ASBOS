            "First of all very thanks to Flipkart for timely delivery and delivery at rural like area(My village).Delivery boy was a nice person ,simple ,down to earth and very polite. Now about Refrigerator- Blindly go for it without hesitation if u are small family upto 4 people , in village up to 5 people (because in village all most everything available in fresh condition ,veg ,milk ,buttermilk ,etc and in village not that much of artificial cold drinks stored in refrigerator at home).Design and color are personal choices.performance is best.Boot space is somewhat smaller i think but good at this price point and for 190 ltr capacity. Very silent even not audible near the compressor area.Base drawer quality should be improved but not a problem at all.Overall all Value for money friends...sorry for bad English.",
            "After 1 month uses review - : really very good product. For 10 days u will feel, it makes some noise. But after that it won't noise. It does cooling very well at no. 2 power settings. Very much satisfied. But my product is 190 L. And even deep freezer is very small. A family must need 250 L. But really recommend for 3 people. It's very good product. Go for it. See images below.",
            "I wanna thank flipkart from my heart, product delivered on time and I wanna thank ekart as their delivery person was very humble & polite I dont know his name but Team Ekart you rock guys. This refrigerator is best, there is no noise very attractive look don't think just go for it.",
            "great product from lg \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\nreally awesome no sound\nbut it was too small\nit was for only 2-3 members\nproduct packing was good\nekart and delivery boys kept the product was excellent",
            "Purchased the refigirator on 3rd of July. Received as per delivery date given by Flipkart and in a properly secured manner. Timely delivery by the e-kart guys and had it delivered to my door. Received without any dents or scratches.\n\nComing to the refigirator, it's around 36 kilos in weight with metallic side finish just like an almira and the front fascia is like finished brushed steel and is made up of plastic.\n\nBuild quality and features:\n\n-> Timeless simple design. No fancy colour or stickers.\n->The door handle is finished in chrome and is strong and sturdy. Also there is a recessed handle on top for easy door opening.\n->The interiors of the refigirator look premium and the build quality is excellent.\n->Strong shelves.\n->Ample freezer space\n->Lovely cool and fresh zone\n->Classic timeless yellow ambient lighting\n->Defrost button with temperature control knob\n->The top cover of vegetable box is made of plastic.\n->Medium size vegetable box is provided.\n->Ample space provided on door for bottles.\n->Egg tray is included in the top shelf holder itself.\n->Two liter bottles can be fit easily\n-> Strong antibacterial gasket as mentioned.\n-> looks elegant and proportional in shape and size\n\nOperation:\n-> Super silent compressor & no sound at all.\n-> The interior became cool within an hour of plugging in.\n-> Tested for ice. It made ice in two hours which is awesomely quick.\n-> Kept milk and butter in cool zone and the butter didn't melt. So kudos there LG.\n-> Works on a 6amp plug and no power plug required due to less voltage usage and smart inverter compressor.\n-> Working fine without a stabilizer. Go for one though if frequent fluctuations in your area.\n-> wire is thick and sturdy and will be durable.\n\nBase drawer:\n-> Elegant and functional\n-> Three compartments\n-> Medium in size enough for little vegetables.\n\nNegatives:\n\nJust felt it could have been a little heavier as it moves when I open it.. hehe.. No other cons at all.. it's just a lovely piece of work by LG. Perfect family fridge\n\nOverall impression:\n\nI am more than satisfied with the way it is designed and the way it functions. If your on the lookout for a refigirator for a family of three or four you can go for it with blind eyes. It's that beautiful and good looking along with being super quiet and functional. I am uploading some images so you can get an idea.\n\nThanks for reading my review. Hope it helps you with your decision. :-)",
            "After using approximately two month I am writing this this review. Really nice product got from flipkart and in reasonable price. The quality of the product is really good. This model of LG is really nice. Energy rating given is really true. Packing of Flipkart is good enough. Basically we want to se the quality of the product. So for little family this model is awesome. Recomend to buy. Over all very good.",
            "product is good n performance is also gud bt it's vegetable basket is very small only 4 one people n it's freezer is also very small....I was confused with Godrej 200 capacity refrigerator n lg bt now m very sure that Godrej was better ...m little bit disappointed with vegetable basket....n other thinks like delivery n all was best",
            "I loved the product bcz in low and affordable price the product is good and excellent. Go for it..",
            "Very nice and royal looking finish from the front, stainless steel colour is royal.\nBut side profile colour not great, like ok ok.\nBut overall looking wise good.\nAnd performance is good because of LG, no complaint from this perfect brand.",
            "Ideal for a small family. Compact and small. One can easily shift the refrigerator. Good cooling effect inside the refrigerator even at low settings.\nHopes to give 5 star after 2-3 months based on performance",

            "This refrigerator is best for small families. Good storage capacity as per price. The bottom drawer makes it look good and provide a place to store onions etc. that doesn't need to be refrigerated.\n\nDelivery was really fast, but the delivery guys were reluctant to deliver it on first floor. However, one out of them helped us to lift it for the first floor.",
            "Great refrigerator. Noise is very less. If you are looking for compact refrigerator, this is the one to go for. Inverter compressor saves a lot of electricity.\n\nFlipkart scheduled delivery was awesome as it helps working professional like me to have it delivered conveniently.",
