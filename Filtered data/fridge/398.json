            "I was very judgemental about buying this after hearing about product damage during delivery so I have to write this review to ease others in buying. The product was delivered in excellent condition and the packaging makes sure protection against damage. Fridge is worth the money as it is one time investment and keeps food fresh as described. Excellent space capacity to stack up evrything you need. Very less noise you can almost not hear nything. Installation guy came in just 2 hours of delivery. This has been an awesome buy for me. You don't have to think twice to purchase this.",
            "Very good product from Panasonic at an unbelievable price. Has sufficient storage space. Easy to shift from one place to other since it has wheels. Delivered by Flipkart in good condition but only hassle was to arrange for men to hoist the refrigerator to 3rd floor of my apartment. Installation was done on next day of delivery of the product. Extremely satisfied with the service of Flipkart.",
            "good refrigerator with ample freezer space. shelf depth and height is adequate for placing large bowels. lower vegetable basket is quiet small.no noise even if you stand very close to it. Good cooling even at temperature of 47 degree in my city. you can store good quantities of icecream bricks, and other essentials like dry fruits etc in this fridge. It releases heat by only side walls .Back of the fridge remains cool. so you have no need to leave any space between back wall and refrigerator. you can put about 8 bottles of water and 3 large cold drink bottles at a time. The vegetables remain fresh as long as 5-6 days. but fruits can be placed for only 3 days maximum.",
            "just 1 week of operational fridge, good value for money fridge of this capacity, and good after sale installation and service staff.\nhowever there are some of the things that I see not working for me.\n1 the fruit and vegetable baskets are very small for the fridge of this size, they are not deep and storage capacity is small in the baskets.\n2 in the freezer section the I was told that door panel is like chiller, but anything store there is also getting frozen, any cheese sauces milk etc everything freezes.",

            "Perfect choice for me, first I was hesitating to buy Panasonic brand but now I must say it's amazing experience to own Panasonic side by side refrigerator previous I owened Electrolux single door refrigerator so decided to own any premium this time delivery by Flipkart in just 4 days in solid condition not any single scratches on it delivered by blue dart now come to space it has huge space perfect for 8 ppl family although we r only 4 ppl choiced this now I come to power consumption .we r all Indian first see how much power any appliances consumption before buying I did checked on various websites but no where's mentioned abt it still took risk and bought even Panasonic website shows nothing abt power efecency it's consuming abt 170 watt in first start up that means it will consume between 1 to 1.5 unit per day depends on how many time u open and close it yearly consumption could be between 350 to 500 unit it's very very very reasonable consumption go for it don't hesitate to buy it just own it thank you Flipkart for sweet deal during anniversary sale",

            "it's a very nice product, totally worth for money\nbest budget side by side fridge,just go for it without any hesitation. nice thing is the cooling speed and electric consumption i.e, rapid cooling and less consumption",
            "One of the best buys that I have done online. I was sceptical about 1. The performance of the product and 2. The delivery without damage.\nFlipkart delivered it in pristine condition on the scheduled day (my preference of Saturday) and in about 3 hours had a visit by the Panasonic engineer for installation.\n\nPros: the fridge is a beauty, has enough space for a large family, it is inexpensive compared to other brands.\nCons: heats from the sides which is usual but because of its large size o...\nREAD MORE",
