            "Awesome product from flipkart... i loved the brand of haier i have one haier fridge which i using it from past 11 years and it is in good condition without any repairs...",
            "Awesome super product just go for its best for couple's or 3members it's look classy super performance really good safe delivery thanks flipkart",
            "Power consumption:\nThis one consumes 3 times more than specified electricity consumption.\n\nNoise:\nAnnoying rattle coming from behind the refridgerator. It increases when loaded with new objects. And in summer mode it's even more annoying.\n\nCooling:\nTakes too long to cool in lower compartments but it's fine. since it keeps temperature low for reasonably long time. Freezing is done quicker, although it takes more than 1hour.\n\nDesign and features:\nDesign is average. It's a bit hard to open the door sometimes. I almost tilted the fridge when opening one time. And the door compartments come out from slot easily with little force. Blance is off when putting big bottles in the door.\nNow for the temperature control, it has only three modes. I don't know if there's any intermediate states since there is no numbers to specify.\n\nPrice:\nIt's a good product for its price. I bought this 20% off from standard price.\n\nWell those are the shortcomings of this product but for it's price it is a good one. If your are at a budget this one is a better choice. If you wanted more features and performance this is not a good choice.",
            "Cooling is good. Design impress me. Fastest icing refrigerator i have ever experienced. the Only thing is noise can be reduced in this model. we can hear the sound while its operation. otherwise product is worth buying. I am completely satisfied with product. and fastest delivery for Flipkart.",

            "Loved refrigerator, it should have MADE IN INDIA TAG",
            "Bought this refrigerator during the big billion sale 2021. First impression is good, however listing few points which are a little bit issue from practical usage perspective -\n\n1. Power cord of the fridge originates from bottom and is barely 6 inch more than height of the fridge. Just a fyi that the height of fridge is only about 4 ft. Generally the power sockets on the wall are at a height of 5 ft. So to use the new fridge, I had to change my electric fittings in order to plug in the fridge. This incurred me another thousand bucks.\n\n2. This fridge has only 2 supporting legs in the front whereas in the rear there is a thin metal compressor casing which touches the ground. So practically the ground clearance is 0. You can never be able to clean the surface below the fridge. Use of a refrigerator plastic stand is inevitable. This incurs another 250 - 300 bucks.\n\n3. There is no installation provided by the company. It is DIY type of purchase.\n\n4. This product is manufactured in China and sold in India by Haeir. I am personally disappointed buying Chinese goods.",

Haier also provided us with a link on youtube for a product demo. The fridge is good. Cools really well and very energy efficient. The door hinge has a stopper which does not let thr door go all the way back and stops at 135 degrees. So if you leave the door open and it goes back, there will br a stopper to stop the door. It includes a egg tray. It has a total of 4 shelves WHICH CANNOT BE ALTERED AND ARE AT A FIXED POSITION. The light provided is at a corner and is not sufficient enough. One must also note that there are no pegs on the back side and the front pegs are distored because of thr door hinge, meaning one is way front and the other one is way back. I also found that to open the door, you will need to hands to open it, but i guess it is because its a new piece and would fade as time goes by. I bought this product because this was the most energy efficient fridge out of the lot as well the warranty thry provide with it.\n\nTo conclude\nDelivery 10/10\nPerformance 10/10\nStorage 7.5/10\nLight - Poor\nDesign - 10/10",
