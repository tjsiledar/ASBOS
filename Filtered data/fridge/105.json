            "Same day installation and demo on the delivery.\nThe technician was available in our locality so luckily got it done.\n\nFirst day review. The cooling is amazingly fast.\nSpacious indeed. More than satisfactory for a family of four. Should check how the power consumption so far is. The blast freeze option is amazing. Ice cubes formed within 30mins.\n\nWill update the review after a month of usage.\nI'd say go for it.\nBecause it's the only five star rated tripe door fridge in this price segment.\n\nUPDATE AFTER THREE MONTHS OF USAGE :\nElectricity bill in our house use to be around 1.8k a month on an average. After switching to this refrigerator, it's lowered down to 1.1k per month. A significant change. Adding to this fridge's power saving, I did change all of my house lightings to 10W LEDs too. Significant saving of an average of 700rs per month on electricity bills.\nIt's the best fridge at thus price segment. More than enough for a family of four.\nSatisfied. \ud83d\udcaf",
            "This fridge is really the best at low prices from United States Brand's - Whirlpool. I believe it's really hard to get a good brand of another brand at this price. Its design and its quality are really stunning and superb. It can not be compared to other brands. Simply Awesome!\n\nMy Thought About Refrigerator:\n\nOn a very local scale, a refrigerator is the center of the universe. On the inside is food essential to life, and on the outside of the door is a summary of the life events of the household.",
            "all are happy in our family . we got a wonderful refrigerator at affordable price.. thanks whirlpool\nn a big thanks to flipkart because of flipkart we brought our desired refrigerator at a good price..\nhighly recommended..\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc98\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc93\u2764",
            "Amazing refrigerator with triple door cooling\nfacility. \ud83e\udd17\nIt's very spacious and the design is fantastic. The most remarkable feature of this refrigerator is the ice tray which is having a regulator to collect the ice cubes.\nI am fully satisfied with this product!!!\ud83d\ude00\nThank you Whirlpool and Flipkart !!\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a",
            "I think this is the best in its class. I bought it to my village and Flipkart delivered it in time and their is not a single scratch on the refrigerator. Kudos to Flipkart.\nThe benefits of buying the fridge online are\n1 Best price\n2 No need to arrange a Vechile to bring it home so no extra cost\n3 Timely delivery\n\nFinally my experience was very nice",
            "I will recommend this product.\nPros:\n\n1. Good three door fridge with separate space for vegetables, dairy products and water bottles.\n2. Low electricity consumption\n3.

Thanks Whirlpool.",
            "Same day installation and demo on the delivery.\nThe technician was available in our locality so luckily got it done.\n\nFirst day review. The cooling is amazingly fast.\nSpacious indeed. More than satisfactory for a family of four. Should check how the power consumption so far is. The blast freeze option is amazing. Ice cubes formed within 30mins.\n\nWill update the review after a month of usage.\nI'd say go for it.\nBecause it's the only five star rated tripe door fridge in this price segment.\n\nUPDATE AFTER THREE MONTHS OF USAGE :\nElectricity bill in our house use to be around 1.8k a month on an average. After switching to this refrigerator, it's lowered down to 1.1k per month. A significant change. Adding to this fridge's power saving, I did change all of my house lightings to 10W LEDs too. Significant saving of an average of 700rs per month on electricity bills.\nIt's the best fridge at thus price segment. More than enough for a family of four.\nSatisfied. \ud83d\udcaf",
            "This fridge is really the best at low prices from United States Brand's - Whirlpool. I believe it's really hard to get a good brand of another brand at this price. Its design and its quality are really stunning and superb. It can not be compared to other brands. Simply Awesome!\n\nMy Thought About Refrigerator:\n\nOn a very local scale, a refrigerator is the center of the universe. On the inside is food essential to life, and on the outside of the door is a summary of the life events of the household.",

Middle section though have effectively less storage, even in door can't store that much bottles as in average single door. This is due to the three section.

            "Exceptionally excellent!! I did not expect the delivery date to be very next day of the order placement. i got sms throughout about the updates, I placed the order at around 10:37 am and the product got delivered next day at 3:15 pm. the seller and off course Flipcart had been really efficient and professional. Flipcart itself intimate the manufacturer and the service guy came the very next day of the delivery. A big thank you.\n\nThe product is having a very sleek design with beautiful finish. its quiet spacious . The drawer below is quiet spacious and can hold vegetable stock of at least 5 days. the only complain is that the middle door has a makeup space and chocolate box which of no use to bachelors instead a rack for small bottles would have been of real great use , just installed yesterday and it is working fine. right now I cannot comment on the working of it, I am very satisfied with the product.",
            "Got an awesome product with really fast delivery.The only complain I have is with Flipkart. I exchanged my old refrigerator with this product and as soon as the product was delivered my old refrigerator was picked up. The installation would be done by the Whirlpool staff and if we try to do it then the warranty would be void. This means that I was left with no refrigerator for 24 hours. One can imagine how difficult it is nowadays without refrigerator. The process could have been more smooth if the installation would have been done on the same day. Yet, let me describe the product..\nThe pros of the product:\n\u2022Really spacious if you have a family of 4-6 people.\n\u2022 The space for keeping vegetables separately is a thumbs up.\n\u2022 I loved the freezer because it's really spacious specially designed for those who keep their freezer loaded with ice cream,cheese and other frozen stuffs.\n\nHowever, let's also talk about the cons of the product.\n\u2022 The space provided for keeping water bottles is very less. Only 500-600ml bottles can be kept there. If you have 1ltr. Bottles then you have to keep it in the lower shelf of the fridge.\n\u2022 The space provided for keeping butter has consumed the space provided for keeping water bottles.\nHowever, you can go for it guys if you want a designer refrigerator at this price. Overall having a good experience.",
            "The refrigerator is quite good and is a new offering from Whirlpool. The refrigerator is supposed to operate without a stabilizer but Whirlpool installation guy will try to sell it. So if the voltage in your area is stable, then there is no need for the stabilizer and the same is clearly mentioned in the manual. Flipkart delivery was flawless and Ekartl guys delivered the product at my doorstep and even placed it in the correct place as requested. For installation, one can wait for Flipkart to arrange the installation or you can directly call Whirlpool customer support aand ask them to arrange the installation. Installation was done on the same day the product was delivered. Will update on the performance of the refrigerator after a month.",
            "Best refrigerator, good looking, large size, power saving, purchased for my parents. Already using the same model for the last 3 years without any problem. Vegetable compartment is unique and very useful. Better than double door fridge. Steel finish is very fine and looks beautiful.",

            "Product is good and delivery was on time. Major drawback is with replacement policy. New refrigerator was delivered and old one was taken away on the same day but installation of new one was done 2 days after the delivery. So technically, customer has to suffer without refrigerator untill the installation is completed.\nMy installation was scheduled for 3-4 days post delivery, but luckily Whirlpool service was great that they installed within 2 days.\nThis is so called Flipkart exchange policy that old product is taken when new is delivered irrespective of the case whether the new one works properly or not.",
            "Very nice product. No issue till now. The company's engineer who came to demonstrate came at his ease and not considering my convenient time.

The Delivery Boy told , the installation will be done with in 24 hours after delivery and this did not happen, I had to call Flipkart help desk and that is the time they have initiated the installation with whirlpool and hence I lost 1 day.

            "It is been over 3 months we have purchased, and we loved the design not only metallic finishing but 5he concept of 3 doors. It keeps veggies and other items separate which helps in keeping the items away from mixing ouders and maintains extra level of hygiene. For family of 4 it is a good option. The ordering and installation experience and also customer care support was good from flipkart. The only problem is its height. After using fridge stand, it is to tall for 5ft person.",

Keeps at optimum chilling point. Just excellent.\n\nAfter one year: I have been using this fridge for one year now. I must say, this is one thing that has made my life so easy. Left curd while going out for 10 days in chiller compartment. It was just as fresh as when I had left it. All the above things that I had experienced earlier are working same as brand new.

It has four compartments, the width is little less than the other fridge, but good to do for a small family. Only one tray for water bottles. The vegetable basket has good space though. If you are ready to restrict yourself with the space and want a triple door in easy price, this is the product for you.",

It has shelves which are very low height and hence can't keep any big vessels in it. Also there is only one door shelf for keeping water bottles and that too you can only keep 2 bottles of 1 litre and not more than that. For keeping 2 more bottles, you need to fold the foldable rack.\nFor its price the fridge seems to be good, its compact width wise and tall.\nBut I wish the middle section had less number of shelves but with more height.",

This three door product made even ozone friendly even by having isolated parts. The only con is it doesn't have large containing space inside as the size of the fridge looks big from outside but it's more than enough for a small family with three or four members. Family with 4 members may think this would be large for them but this is exactly for them but not for a family with more than four members.
