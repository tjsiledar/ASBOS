So very less risk of the top and sides getting scratched.\n3) The refrigerator does not make much of noise, that's the perk of buying a 5 star fridge.\n\nLater I will update about the power consumption of the fridge and any issues if I come across.",

I am happy with the performance, looks, silent operation and space available in the refrigerator.",
            "Bought this fridge around 15 days Back.The fridge is awsome and has very good cooling best thing is it even runs through inverter.design is good just a bit lack of space",
            "Very good product and attractive like a love",
            "Well the fridge is only good looking, you have to press the door every time closing it,otherwise whole fridge will be watery due to moisture from outside air, ( many other fridges have a tilted structure and closes easily even left the door half open), next you have to defrost every alternative day( though written twice in a week. No automatic vapour system ,so you have to clean the water from the defrost twice a week from backside pannel.Last but not the list while installing the representative did not remove the stand thermocol ! Later I came to know due to this fridge door was not locking properly. Not recommended at all. Two star is given for looks.",
