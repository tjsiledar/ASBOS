Initially freezer stopped working, I contacted godrej team, they sent their personnel within a day. That personnel asked to place a return request as it has not even been 15 days since receiving the order. Later I contacted flipkart regarding the same matter and they said, matter will be resolved before 1st September. Now, its 1st September, refrigerator completely stopped working since 31st Aug, spoiling my complete food inside. I had never experienced such pathetic product experience from flipkart. As for godrej, this kind of product experience completely drowns the company's name. I would think twice before purchasing any godrej product.",
