            "Firstly, it was to be installed by company technitian. But no one turn up for weeks.

The door closing require specific effort.",

It takes my whole strength to pull the door because its getting stuck again and again and it's leaving water every where from the icebox which is leaving spoilage to everything that's kept in the friz.",
            "Issues with the model:\n1. The door won\u2019t automatically close.\n2. A lot if water deposits in the defrost tray behind.\n3. A lot of water deposit inside the fridge under the tray.\n\nI\u2019ll suggest go for LG, they are anyday winner in Refrigerators.",
