Besides that our tap water pressure is bit low and we get notified for that even then this machine doesn't make any issue in washing clothes,it just takes more time to clean which is obvious because of pressure but it still does the job.

            "Worth the money. Good for bachelors/couples. Enough storage space. Not much noise. Cooling is good. Demo and installation was smooth. Overall good buy in budget!",
            "Ok here is my review after using it for 2 months. This fridge is priced very decently and is bang for every buck you put in. The 190L powerhouse is adequate for a family of maximum four people. The product delivers what the company promises. There are a few pros and cons thati would want to point out :-\n\n#Cons\n1) The chiller is just too small for a 1liter bottle to fit in and not too many things can be kept at a time init.\n\n2)Ice build up way too quickly even in the lowest setting I need to defrost it twice a month.\n\n3)The compressor makes a lot of noise and is heard from my next room also.\n\n4) The moisture control thing makes no sence at all as it does not seal the veggie basket completely\n\n5) The waste water basket should have been detachable as taking out the water becomes very tedeous\n\n6)The power cable could have been longer.\n\n#Pros\n\n1)The price makes it a steal offer and is very very affordable.\n\n2)The fridge is light hence moving it around is not a issue.\n\n3)The cooling is really fast and keeps the internal temparature steady even in long loadshedding\n\n4)Enough space in veggie box and as well ain the fridge\n\n5)Energy efficiency is effective barely eny difference I. my electricity bill.\n\n6)Ice barely takes 45minits in medium settings\n\n7)The chiller tray can hold upto 10pkts of half liter milk\n\n8)the fridge itself is compact and does not eat up space.",
            "This is a great refrigerator and the electricity bill is also very reasonable.\n\nThis is better than the Samsung refrigerator that I have used.\n\nThe freezer works great with fast freezing",
            "Awesome product fastest cooling best brand affordable price I'm fully satisfied with this product thank you flipkart super fast delivery within 24 hour",

            "Nice performance at this moments of Whirlpool Refrigerator. I will give up feedback after 3 months again. At this moment all looks good. But I have faced some hazard at the time of delivery of Refrigerator at my home. And also faced Installation request placing hazard because Flipkart deny to sent Installation Engineer. Then they suggested to call whirlpool customer care but they also at first denied. Again I call whirlpool customer care then they have sent Installation Engineer. Overall i rate 3 star out 5 for all these reason. Otherwise I will rate 5 star.",
