            "The fridge looks good. Works great so far. No complaints as yet. Fit and finish looks decent but not super premium. Haier was very prompt with the installation/demo. So all in all a good shopping experince.\n\nThe fridge works well too. Very deep and spacious inside. I like the idea of the chiller tray being below. Makes a lot of sense. Unless your chiller is cooling the rest of the fridge... I'm not sure why you'll want it anywhere else.",
            "Fabulous product from Haier. Good design, good cooling. But as mentioned in the description, there is no coolpad. Haier technician said coolpad option not available for this model. Technician charged rupees 400/ (with invoice) extra for fitting two germ filter inside the fridge, which is optional. Overall experience good.",

            "Finally bought this fridge after comparing with so many other ones. Looks amazing and very spacious from inside.

Great product within good price! Happy & satisfied customer!!",

            "The Haier BMR Refrigerator is awesome. The product is really worth the price and thanks to FLIPKART for offering it at such genuine affordable price, compared to the current market price. The cooling is excellent and best suited with a large capacity to hold. Especially the vegetable box is comparatively huge and quite spacious. This product was delivered very prpart is reallly omptly on time and the service of delivery and installation are excellent and is highly recommended. The BMR innovative technology is it's hazzle-free fridge component, which is mounted on top, and relieves us from bending to use the fridge regularly. The freezer component is really spacious and is bottom mounted, which is so innovative and spectacular.",

            "Haier double door 320 l refrigerator is excellent and I am immensely satisfied. Earlier I have purchased top load washing machine also and it is also good. I am happy with Haier.",
            "Brilliant refrigerator with great features. The best part is you don't have to bend for daily usage, BMR (Bottom Mounted Refrigerator) is the future of refrigerators.\nInstallation and attitude of the service engineer is great. Really happy with my purchase!",
            "The fridge is well designed. Came in international packing. The delivery team unpacked the item, however we were asked to wait for Installation by the company. The Haier Company installation guy came next day.\n\nThe fridge has lots of space on the top. Best part is that you do not have to bend down every time when you want to take the vegetable basket. It is opening like a wardrobe.\n\nFridge is mostly silent, the freezer door was making some sound at the time of closing. The installation guy fixed the problem. (He was initially trying to leave without attending to it, however it involved tilting and resting the fridge side ways, which he wanted to avoid. This is typical problem with service engineers in India.)\n\nThe fridge cooling is good , since it is peak summer now (May Month) and temprature is 40C plus. The fridge is working well. (It is new at present, hence to be seen after few years). You would find LED lights inside which is whiter than normal yellow bulb found in old fridge. The food may look different inside the fridge due to white/blue light.\n\nOverall very good product.",
            "Well, the cooling is great. Infact more then enough and that's what bothers me.\nAt the very first day, I set the fridge on medium temperature(both refrigerator and freezer), then freezer was okay and satisfactory but problem came with refrigerator. It started freezing the stuff and then I set refrigerator on low temperature. But still, it won't changed its behaviour and hence, it froze the milk there.\nBut as per the ethics of electronics, I gave it few time and now it working good as expected and looking forward for making great deal with this product.\nAlthough, the technician came was decent and expert with his work I must say.",
            "First time I was ordered this high cost product through online. But everything is excellent as committed.\nI was received the product without any damage. While opened I was came to know that one of the part ie cool pad (Loose Piece) is missing> I made a request to flipkart and Haier customer care within 48hrs I was received the same.\nThe refrigerator till date running smoothly.\nNow I am having confident to purchase Higher value item through online.and the online support system also GOOD",
            "Hot this fridge for my mom , a gift on her 35th Marriage Anniversary. She liked it a lot. The best part is Refrigerator is upside and freezer is at the bottom. Believe me it makes a huge difference while day to day usage. Do opt for bottom freezer. This fridge has a big capacity. 320L is good enough for family of 4 to 5 persons. Freezer is big too. Load consumption is very low 265 units/yr. Inverter compressor. I got it in 24490/- No dents or damages. Demo was given very next day. Very satisfied with performance. Cooling is very good. Quality of product is also good. I recommend it. In this price range its The Best. Good luck.",
            "nice product from haier. It delivers most what you can get in given prize. Space is enough for a medium family and it looks good from outside. Special thanx to flipkart who delivered it right on time. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",
            "fridge is good looking..\n320L capacity is very good for a family..\nbottom mounted freezer makes more sense.\ndelivery was good & installation & demo took 9 days after delivery..\nfridge makes sound...[not too loud] comparing to other brand it little louder..\nStabilizer is needed for this fridge..\n*bottom freezer door is not closing properly (service is done now it's fine)\notherwise everything is fine..",

Silent and quick cooling. 1 hour ice technology. Coolpad available. Look is good but not premium like stainless steel.",

            "In last 45 years I have used almost all brands of fridges. Not used Haier products earlier. Was hesitating before ordering. But after receiving the fridge I am very happy. Silent running, good cooling all around, spacious and pleasing appearance. The bottom freezer is big relief for the back in the long run. I ordered on 16/3 morning. The fridge arrived on 18/3 morning. Haier technician came on 18/3 evening and it is running smoothly since then.",
            "Superb! Modern, good looking, sleek fridge. We were looking for a bottom mount freezer refrigerator and this seemed to be the best one out there. We were told by a couple of experts that this is an efficient, long lasting model. The delivery persons were not very professional and there was a glitch in the installation process but Haier sent the right guy at the end who did the needful. Purchased it last week. So far so good. Touch wood.",

            "item is good and delivery also good, thanks to Flipkart for new technology Fridge (JHUKUNA MATH --- Concept). I felt very happy in selecting this item. Only one thing is I didn't get COOL PAD (In item specifications this COOLPAD was there) Item along with Fridge ( checked by engineer while Demo) even after consulting Flipkart for so many times but no use . This is my experience , still I am happy because I am the customer of this Flipkart since 2014...... ( please resolve like this problems if any because it's all customer satisfaction is important.... Thank you Team Flipkart...",
            "Excellent faster delivery by flipkart and prompt installation by Haier on very next day of delivery.\n\nThe refrigerator is beautiful and has good build quality. Having freezer at bottom is an excellent idea. You need not bend anytime for everyday uses.\nThe vegetable section is too spacious and easily fits 1 week vegetables for us.\n\nThe white LED light inside add on to its beauty. Overall good experience and highly recommended to all.",
            "The basics - looks good, silent operation, nice cooling, everything positive so far (used for about 6 months now). The bottom freezer is quite a good idea, as the fridge is truly the one used most, and the freezer pretty infrequently. The installation etc. was smooth. Claims to use very less electricity, which is good too. Switching on the first time after installation it took a couple of hours to get cool, I guess that's par for the course! I like the twist ice tray provided with the fr...\nREAD MORE",
            "It's a great product at its best price. Got it for 22,000 and replaced my old fridge. The concept of freezer being at the bottom is the best feature for a fridge. Otherwise as well the compartments are spacious and deep. Highly recommended I am reviewing this after a month of purchase",
            "Everytime I open my fridge door, I fall in love with it, yet again. The inside space, the shelf life never imagined so. Veg that rotted in 3 days in earlier fridge stayed fresh in this for 3 weeks! No more words! However, Haier agents showed up after 10 days for installation. Did not matter though. Installation was easy; my hubby had just plugged it into the power socket and 2 hours later it was ready for use!",
            "The freezer being at the bottom is a key feature and is actually rather user friendly. The Compressor is exposed at the back and clear instructions to keep space (6 inches) on back and sides to have air circulation. There is a vertical plate towards the back of the shelves and the cold air circulation starts from the top (the top shelf is the coldest). So items should be suitably placed with the the lowest shelf having items which do not require too much of refrigration. The Vegetable tray is deep and comes out like a drawer.\nSimilarly, the freezer at the bottom also has a deep tray which slides out.\n\nThe only issue I had was when my daughter dropped a large bottle of coke on the side tray (on the door) while lifting it up and the tray cracked on the impact. I strengthened the cracked tray base with several layers of transparent scotch tape to make it better that the original state (resistant to such shock impacts)",

The convenience of storing vegetables and cooked food at shoulder level instead of bending down was main features.\nThe product finishing and quality is good. And upon installation, the compressor performance, cooling is good, no issues. Also the noise level is quite low which is a plus.\nOne small drawback, would have preferred more robust grill behind the compressor to keep rodents away. Apart from that no other issues.\nWould recommend for those who want similar capacity and are on a similar budget.",

Flipkart people replied they will send again Haier technians for verification. Same technian came for verification on 26th December. Fail to understand why this procedural delay if the same company representative is going to do the audit. Haier engineer is saying he has closed the call with replacement recommendation but Flipkart is claiming otherwise. My wait and agony continues and testing our patiences. Hope to hear some news soon. New replacement is delivered and it's awesome. Bottom mounting is really convient. Broad veg tray. Product is good and recommendable. Flipkart delivery process needs to be flexible and robust.",

            "I ordered Haier's 320L Frost Free refrigerator on October 22 and got the delivery on October 24. I would first like to show a gratitude of appreciation to the flipkart for the on-time delivery of the item, and also for offering me an excellent cashback on Citibank Card. Haier sent out a demo and installation team on October 26. I was impressed by the Haier team's customer centricity, by going great lengths in highlighting the impressive features of the product. I was given an overview of the product's functionalities, with special focus on the Frost free functionality of the refrigerator that I was interested in. I and my family were fully satisfied with the product's capabilities, and was excited to use it. Haier also presented my family a gift, which incidently was one of the things I was looking out for. A big shout out to Haier's ingenuous design to have the vegetable tray on the top door, and incorporating an adjustable tray in terms of height. I was also impressed by the cooling pad, and the easy handling of ice cubes. One of the minor observations that I found out after 5 days of usage is the heating of the side panel, which could be looked into by the Haier design team. Also I felt that the gloss on the side panels paled in comparison with the front door panel. But in overall terms, with respect to form and functionality, this product is way beyond my expectations, and my choice of choosing this brand over others, was ultimately one of the best decisions that I have taken. Thank you Haier and Flipkart !!",
            "Why is that the Product name mention's it as a 320L model while the description says as a 234L model ?",
            "Awesome. Thank you Flipkart",
            "Product looks to be very good. Powerful cooling. Freezer at bottom is very good. Need not to bend for regular use.\nDelivery experience is bad. Looks like delivery boys are not trained to handle appliances. Boys were arrogant. Refused to keep the fridge at location. They were in too much in hury. Handled the product very roughly. Very bad experience of delivery.",

            "Flipkart sent a damaged refrigerator but upon placing a complaint, replaced my fridge. New one is working absolutely fine. Thanks Flipkart.",
            "After 6months am writing reviews it's Good that's all value for money,\nHair Installation person his name Sachin he call and asked me were buy that, I said flipcart he suddenly cut the call and even I did call back, he didn't received....",

            "Installation done me happy with the product as also service by Flipkart. Thanks",
            "Very quickly delivered",
            "The product was delivered & the Haier engineer Mr. Leo came down next day for wasting my time. He was barely talking nor gave any demo. From the get go he wanted to sell me an additional 3 yr extended warantee. I somehow felt he came for up sales rather than demo. He was answering only if I asked questions & finally took the code received via SMS and left. He made me think that I did a huge mistake of buying the fridge (In exchange for my 12 year old Whirlpool that was in an excellent condition)as all the components were costly I will have to spend huge money if something happens. I called Haier CC and reported who in turn gave me the local service centre In charge Yuvaraj's # who didn't pick my call twice nor returned. I texted him saying I had a complaint against one of his engineers and its been 24 hrs and no response. Great!!!\n\nThe fridge looks awesome & very happy after 3 days of usage. Flipkart as usual you guys rock.",
