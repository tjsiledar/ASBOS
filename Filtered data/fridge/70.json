            "Very spacious caters to a family of three very well. Thoughtfully designed especially the crisper box which has been made big though at the cost of space for the water bottle rack at the bottom of the door. Good for vegetarians. The non vegetarian has a huge freezer to be happy with. The flexible fridge freezer idea is good for a young family which travels often. Very good temp control. Tangible since it comes in numerical values rather than the other type which has rotary knobs and indicate only cold and colder. Especially in summers and winters with large temp variations. Go for it. Total Value for money and satisfaction.",
            "superb quality superb cooling\nvery large space\ndelivery very well and timely",
            "Great service by flipkart, awesome product, it's great deal, thanks to flipkart, also great support to installation of his engineer Mr. Asif",
            "It is missing light in freezer section and they should have given a bottom bottle guard. even though it is 324 litres I feel it's congested in storage section because of no bottom bottle guard. Mainly they should have given a bottom bottle gaurd for storing water bottles or cool drinks. and upper guard tray is not feasible for storing big bottles because it stops closing door if you put bigger ones. performance wise it's good with its 5 in 1 convertible features.",
            "Good spacious refrigerator. Delivery and Installation was seamless. Took it in exchange offer and got a decent price for the old refrigerator. Using it for last two days...so far so good..",
            "We were sceptical before buying this... But this was a perfect buy...functions are easy to understand. And lot of space available for even big utensils. They can be placed easily. Conversion mode is very handy. Fresh room is available. Color the silver one, is very simple and elegant. Vegetable box is spacious. Very happy with the purchase.",
            "One of the best deals I got on flipkart, got it for 24,000 during big billion sale (without exchange). It was delivered flawlessly (within 3 days) and installation was done on the same day by Samsung technician.\nComing to the features.\nPros :\n1. Power rating is very low (it consumes less than half the power of my current Samsung 265 ltrs fridge)\n2. Smart convertable feature is very convenient\n3. It can run on home inverter system (not tested yet)\n4. Enough space for a family of 3 to 4 people\nCons :\n1. Only one row for Bottle holder\n2. The metallic finish (surface) is fingerprint magnet and is prone to scratches",
            "Smart and sharp design with exciting color \"Pebble Blue\". Ample space and completely reliant on Samsung's performance since using another one since 2003! Got good deals and offers. Flipkart product assurance and delivery as usual superb. Never failed to impress.",
            "Fantastic features, built quality & stylish look.\n\nThis was my second unit to home. I've bought a 345 L and this one was for my wife. I can see a very happy user's :)",
            "Samsung 324 is an awesome refrigerator, bought one at Great India Sale, Elegant Inox, luckily got the fridge\ndelivered with out any scratches, the only hitch was delivery, Flipkart and its Logistics counterpart eKart never delivered\non time, even the manufacturer Samsung dragged 'installation & demonstration' by 72 hours, saving grace is service engineer\nfrom Samsung, who explained about the fridge in lucid terms, in fact we know the functionality of the refrigerator, as we use\nthe similar higher end Hitachi in the US!",

Thoughtfully designed especially the crisper box which has been made big though at the cost of space for the water bottle rack at the bottom of the door. Good for vegetarians. The non vegetarian has a huge freezer to be happy with. The flexible fridge freezer idea is good for a young family which travels often. Very good temp control. Tangible since it comes in numerical values rather than the other type which has rotary knobs and indicate only cold and colder. Especially in summers and winters with large temp variations. Go for it. Total Value for money and satisfaction.",
            "superb quality superb cooling\nvery large space\ndelivery very well and timely",
            "Great service by flipkart, awesome product, it's great deal, thanks to flipkart, also great support to installation of his engineer Mr. Asif",
            "It is missing light in freezer section and they should have given a bottom bottle guard. even though it is 324 litres I feel it's congested in storage section because of no bottom bottle guard. Mainly they should have given a bottom bottle gaurd for storing water bottles or cool drinks. and upper guard tray is not feasible for storing big bottles because it stops closing door if you put bigger ones. performance wise it's good with its 5 in 1 convertible features.",

            "One of the best deals I got on flipkart, got it for 24,000 during big billion sale (without exchange). It was delivered flawlessly (within 3 days) and installation was done on the same day by Samsung technician.\nComing to the features.\nPros :\n1. Power rating is very low (it consumes less than half the power of my current Samsung 265 ltrs fridge)\n2. Smart convertable feature is very convenient\n3. It can run on home inverter system (not tested yet)\n4. Enough space for a family of 3 to 4 people\nCons :\n1. Only one row for Bottle holder\n2. The metallic finish (surface) is fingerprint magnet and is prone to scratches",

Go for Samsung buy from Flipkart only.",
            "Flipkart immediately responded to my orders on COD and sent refrigerator within 3 days and the technician next day came and attended demo. He is so polite and taught how to operate this version. He is Nagendra good at his work. Now a days the most of the technicians are not attentive and not caring the customer. They demand additional charges and rude to their work as well as towards customer. This technician is good and not asked any penny. The refrigerator is top branded one and it\u2019s working condition is good. But it had no handle and child lock facility. But it is ok for this budget",
            "This Samsung fridge is very decent looking model. It is very durable and has very fast cooling. It comes with in built stabilizer with voltage fluctuation range of 100v to 300v.
