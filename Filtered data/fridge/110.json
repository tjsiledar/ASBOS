            "Extremely happy about my decision to buy this fridge.

The installation and demo was done by an LG technician satisfactorily, but it took 2 days after delivery, that too after calling the customer care for speeding up the installation. (LG warranty will be applicable only if the installation and demo is done by their technician)\nOverall, I\u2019m extremely happy about my LG 420 ltr double door fridge as of now.\nThank you Flipkart, Thank you LG..!!!",

The flipkart delivery was on time and no scratches or dent on the product. The exchange part was not that smooth, the delivery perspn initially did not take the old unit because of their defined quality checks. However later on he agreed, maybe Flipkart can improve this aspect.\n\nThe fridge is spacious and has all the required facilities. Door alarm after 1 minute of continuous door open. I never believed in the 5in1 convertible concept and opted this over Samsung. Also the Net space is more in LG comparee to Samsung, ultimately that is what counts the most.",

            "No 1 refrigerator all over India capacity so more intelligent cooling best design LG is no 1 in Home appliances thanks to flipkart for fastest delivery good \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d luck to flipkart",
            "Just delivered yesterday... Till now everything is perfect.\nRest is performance which can be reviewed after long time.",
            "Great product. Working smoothly. Very satisfied. Silent operation. Worth it. Highly recommended",
            "Very good fridge",
            "The delivery was on time. There were less hands to move it from the vehicle. It was dropped too, no major damage though. Its been 2 weeks now. It is working fine",
            "Good",
            "Changed from a whirlpool 450L that was close to 15yrs old. The LG seems quieter and surely more power efficient but can do better on the quality of the interior shelves and space utilisation.\n\nHaving said this, we could for all we had in our old fridge into this and still have some space left. This was mainly due to more space in the freezer door where a lot of bottles and boxes could fit in.\n\nWaiting to see the effect on power bills. On paper LG fridges seem to score high on efficiency. Plus the fact that this fridge can run on a inverter during power cuts. This is a Huge advantage..",
