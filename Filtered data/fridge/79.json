It was delivered by two delivery person in a tempo. Since I live in a flat at 1st floor, I had to help the two delivery person for carrying the refrigerator to my house. I have no problem in providing a helping hand but there is a major chance that such electronic appliance may suffer a permanent damage while carrying if there are insufficient people to carry it. So I would request flipkart to allot more people for carrying such heavy appliances.",
