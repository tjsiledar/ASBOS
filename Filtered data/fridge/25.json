Ramthalla Retail was the seller - I don't know if it was damaged from factory, in their shop or during transit but it was.\n\nI didn't return it because it works fine - applied a bit of tape to cover it. I also appreciate delivery during tough COVID times. But yeah, just be sure to check fridge thoroughly when engineer comes for installation, back side, inside (remove all trays, etc.)\n\nStay safe!",
