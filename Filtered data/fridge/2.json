            "Super product. Color, look, design, performance is good.. we liked it so much. But it has narrow glass shelves and only one ice tray which is also very small.. base drawer is not a easy going one, cannot draw it smoothly. Apart from these 3 things, remaining options are the best.",

The leather-texture finish on the sides also look very premium.\nDelivery is also satisfactory as i didn't find any dent or scratch on the body. I bought this fridge after reviewing many models so i hope it works as expected.\nSo far the performance and real rating is concerned, i will update this comment after two months of usage.\nThanks.",
