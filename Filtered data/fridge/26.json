            "Honestly i was very happy with this buy.. Its design and quality is good and performance also very good.. Before i buying this i had compared with this to samsung and heir but finally got best in this class. I surely recommend to new buyers without hesitation go for it..",

            "Awesome performance, perfect to the purpose.\nEverything described about this refrigerator is one hundred percent correct.\nLooks are awesom, even though nowadays LED lights are being used but this one has yellow light I am not sure if this is LED or not but as you can see in images the light increased the attractiveness.\nUser manual has nothing good for operation you have to dig a lot on internet to understand the modes and what type of cooling will be provided in which mode.\nYou can not identify what to do if you want manual cooling in upper and lower compartment.\nAfter searching a lot I have came to conclusion that the best mode for this refrigerator is ****Flexi Cool=Auto and Nob in refrigerator=Normal**** in this setting you can get icebox ready in approx 2.5Hrs.\nPlease note you can not run this refrigerator in highest mode i.e. nob=deep freez and flexi cool=high for more than 4 hrs.\nIf someone can help me with ( which setting I do require for high cooling in lower compartment and normal cooling in freezer compartment) I will really appreciate it.",
            "This is one of the best Refrigerator which I have received. Thank you Flipkart for keeping this Refrigerator in your Catalog. After researching in Internet, came to know that this is the best refrigerator of the year and very happy to see the design and the cool temperature of this product \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00",
            "\" Whirlpool is Whirlpool\" in a fridge segment. Everyways it's better than any other brands as per my personal view.\n\nPerformance: Though I am using this model for 3 days. But I tried every types of checking. It's making ice in 45 mints in normal/ auto mode. Making icecream in 2.5 hours in Deep freezer mode. Vegetables are fresh and milk are not damaged even after 8 hours of electric cut off.\n\nElectric Consumption: 190 unit per year as written in the fridge, but still I am not sure as I didn't check it with proper checking but honestly it is consuming very lesser than the previous 3 star fridge.\n\nDesign: In design it's spacious. But I need more options like covered bread space inside. And bottle holders and small Vegetables like lemon , chilly holder inside vegetable bucket were missing as I saw in the same model's fridge in others house. Don't know why these are jot there. It's 5.4 ft in hight.\n\nDelivery: Delivery was smooth. Delivery person was using every possible options to make the delivery Hygienic and better.\n\nInstallation & Demo: I had to face a lot of issue in demo & installation. I called several times to flipkart CC and whirlpool cc. But didn't get much solutions. Then I get to contact with local Area managers of whirlpool and he personally get this issue resolved. But Demo is not fully convincing.\n\nOverall: Overall it's a good product. You can obviously go for this. A lot of person can tell that thus one is not fully convertible as like samsung one but I am assuring that u will get an option of convert the frizer to fridge if u are not required of ice. Or more chilling. But u cannot keep vegetables in converted frizer then also. And u can go for 5 convertible mode in this fridge, where the temperature is preset. But in Samsung u have to set the temperature as well. So if u are having less technical persons in family then u should opt for Whirlpool one as it is not confusing. So if u are opting for this u will have happiness !!!!\n\nGo for this.",
            "The refrigerator is very awesome.It has a good space and a nice cooling..color looks attractive.design is attractive.fast cooling.the sound of compressor is very low.overall it is cool product.should buy it...The delivery was very fast and installation was done in 2 hrs..",
            "Whirlpool refrigerator is the best in its segment no doubt. I just worry about its delivery to my home. Now I feel very happy and relaxed after safest and successful home delivery. Product reached at my home without a single scratch. It's packing was excellent . Thank you Flipkart for your extraordinary and unbelievable services.",
            "Awesome looking refrigerator and Magnum Steel is a classy one if you are confused with colours. The cooling is optimum and soothing. The automatic all season mode takes care of all the hassles of adjusting the refrigerator cooling based on seasonal changes and lot more. The space management is descent and it easily holds a lot of food items. Whirlpool is a nice brand which provides amazing Fastrack services and Installation was blazing fast. The controls are easy and in fact lot more easier than any conventional ones. Highly recommended!",
            "It's Whirlpool after all. No comments!!! The refrigerator has excellent depth to store stuff, neatly planned and efficient in cooling. The black color adds an extra aura of exclusivity, loved and appreciated by many. Thank you Flipkart for having such wonderful products in your platform.",

            "Recently bought 265L Whirlpool refrigerator steel door but it is not convertible, the company has just given some useless features along with it like chef, desert, party, all season, deep freezer modes. Design is so good, sleek, beautiful and elegant design but slight disappointed is that there is no small basket inside vegetable box and water bottle holder is also missing. Performance wise its worth for the money.",
            "Very bad experience.\nFirst the product was faulty. Did not start.\nThe installation team was very unhygienic, without mask/ gloves, leaning all over the house.\nDid not have much clue about their job.\nHave asked for a replacement.\nLet's see how worse it gets.\nDisappointed by Flipkart & Whirlpool which I've used previously for 10 odd years.\n\n\nAnother review post replacement of product.\n\nIt was replaced fine & in time....but , this time the product is damaged from inside (shelves hooks broken, shelves damaged) looks previously used & still is not providing cooling.\nFlipkart seems to back to its old days of providing damaged stuff, like few years back.\nDisappointed.",

            "This was delivered on Sept 9th.\n1) They broke our room door while bringing the Fridge in. I will ignore it because one of the delivery boys was handicapped.

There is no noise from outside, only the ice compartment has noise which can only be felt when you open the door and also no light in upper door. The grocery storages box has less capacity than expected. Its also not looks so big... There is alarm beep if opened more than 1 minute. Child lock key is given too.... Overall this product is value for money. No other products will give you such kind of features in this segment. I got this product at 20490 in BBD Sale....",

Deep freezer is 100% frost free and to my surprise excess water collected at the back also gets auto evaporated with their nee technology. This is available from 2021 models which I got from Flipkart.\n\nFridge has high quality glass partitions, bacteria free carriages which are removable and replaceable. (Costa 850 for all three for every 6 months as Whirlpool has suggested).\n\nI bought an Voltage stabilizer from them (Rs.2150), which offers 2 years of additional warranty for compelte refrigerator and free replacement of those carriages for 3 years. I believe afterwards we can chnage it after longer durations. Tip- Its nota must to get stabilizer, its up to you, I have lot of fluctuations in my area so i did.\n\nOverall great product from Whirlpool!",

Even though the specifications state that it is convertible, and yes it has a dedicated button too. But its for something else....The technician clearly said that there's no such features in this.

Quite impressive service from Flipkart and Whirlpool so far.\nNow lets talk about the Fridge. I got the Fridge just as it was displayed. This one is quite big(292 Lt), big enough for my family of 4 and half(counting my daughter of 6 as a half :)).\nSome how I feel the vegetable basket could have been bigger. Compared to other brand in the similar range, I think this basket is bit small.\nThe Fridge comes with inbuilt stabilizer. Yet the Whirlpool technician insisted me to get one whirlpool external stabilizer for protection of the motherboard of this Fridge. As I am staying in Bangalore and power cut is quite frequent here, having the stabilizer could be good for my Fridge.",

Installation happened 4 days later.. in which time the old fridge was gone and new could not be opened or unwrapped yet. Demo guy disappointed further:\n\n1. There was only guy who visited for installation and not a team as they advertise. He took the help of my old parents\n\n2. The guy declared that if there is a Covid patient in my area then he will not give demo which means he cared for his safety.\nThe Covid related precautions that these guys advertise were not followed. He wore some cloth/winter-gloves like gloves that he had worn were worn before he entered the house which means he wore them on the bike as well. He opened the carton with those and touched the inner surface of the fridge with the same gloves. This shows he doesn't care for my safety..\n\n3. The technician did not explain the 5 modes that the fridge is famous for.\n\nMy observation here is that the advertisements and tall claims are of no good use.\nFlipkart and Whirlpool have both failed me.",
