I've tested it for 12 hrs on inverter and it has given very satisfactory results. Freezer gives instant cooling enough to get ice in an hour. Ice tray design is such that just twist and you'll have a handful ice cubes in your tray. It has cooling distributor from where we can adjust where we need more cooling i.e., in freezer section or in lower compartment. Just one con that it has no light in freezer.\nNow come to lower section, where it has enough space, cooling controller & best part is it's white light.\nI really liked it.\nFinal verdict, the best product in this price range. Go for it without thinking twice. One proud puchase as it's a made in India product.",
