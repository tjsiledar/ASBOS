            "I have been using the qube for over a month. Cooling is good but it takes quite some time to cool. I have also tried to monitor the power consumption with a smart plug and the unit consumes between 14W and 45W for an average consumption of around 0.5KWH per day. So that's around 180 units per year. Even a bigger 200L fridge has lower power consumption. But again the qube is cheap and good for the 3 years with extra warranty and quite suited for my usage so I am content.",
            "Two weeks of Usage.\n\nVery good system. No hassle of compressor or frost. . Just like a cooling box that chills your water and keeps your milk, butter and cheese fresh.. adequate space for one or two people.. very low sound and does not disturb sleep if kept in bedroom. Very Stylish design. Loved it. Real Value for money.\n\nIf you want ice, dont buy. This machine was not made for Freezing. Chilling is perfect\n\nWill update after more use.",

I love this little lovely cooler no worry about gas flings n maintenance... highly recommend",
            "Product was good but if you r really want more features like freezer you can pay some extra money and get a good product I'm not complying about this product the features options are very minimal so for that you can get other brands with more options......",
            "Small fridge. Does exactly what it says. Small fridges in this size from other companies are only available in upto 3* power rating and in direct cool technology. So you will have to deal with high electricity consumption and frequent defrosting. This solves that problem. Consume only 65W energy and is frost free, as it doesn't cool to that level.",
            "Good for storing water, milk. Very portable and elegant looking. I bought it as I don't need a freezer (wish small fridge were coming with auto defrost but since I don't see any options in the market I went for this without freezer capability) Does it job well and worth the money.",
