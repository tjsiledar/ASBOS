            "Not bad",
            "WARNING!!! Guys don't get swayed away by it's classy design, yes it looks beautiful but the refrigerator is very bad. Too shaky, despite trying different ways.\nAlso, the main Reason I'm warning you against this is the Capacity of the fridge from inside and it's lame design due to which you'll literally find it very difficult to put things. The inside space is way too less than advertised because we had 180L LG refrigerator before this one and we literally were able to put more inside that old LG one than this larger refrigerator.\nThey have given more (unnecessary) space to the front door, than the internal and hence wasting lot of space. Also, it's build quality is not very strong.\nI'm really disappointed by Samsung's Refrigerator (bought first time, will be last now). Our 15yr old LG refrigerator 180L was way better than this new model.\nJust wanted to help others by sharing my review so that you also not get fooled by it's looks. Looks are deceptive :p",

            "Super",
            "Very poor design from Samsung. Really disappointed with the performance. Reasons for the same are explained below:\n1. Defrost takes a lot of time (as compared to Godrej which I was using earlier)\n2. While defrosting the melted water drops spill all over the compartments. The collection tray doesn't do its job well.\n3. User guide suggests to defrost twice a week. Its like more defrost than use. Practically we cannot keep family pack ice cream for regular consumption.\n4. If someone doesn't follow the instructions as above, the frosts pile up in such a way that water storage compartment on the back may overflow. Its like do or die.\nMy Godrej refrigerator was way way better than this one.",

            "Being a brand, I didn't expect from Samsung to degrade it's quality at this level to cut the cost.The plastic quality inside the fridge is too low. Post holding and using the plastic trays and other stff (e.g. while freezer door opening) one would never feel confident. No doubt design is beautiful but when it comes to capacity, it's not up to mark + lack of quality material. #Honest Opinion",
