            "The fridge came in good packaging and looks great. Samsung has really done a great job in uplifting the whole face of refrigerator. Thought the shelf glass is not tempered glass and the door shelf is of feeble quality plastic. The refrigerator makes noise if it's not properly balanced on the adjustable heels. Overall it's a great product and can't ask for more in this price segment.",

            "Samsung refrigerators are good built wise. But Yes not as great as Liebher. I have bought two Samsung refrigerators in a year. One for my house in Bangalore which is double door type and another this Single door for my native place. I'm a Vegetarian and don't stock any drinks at home. For my usage from our family point of view, this type and size of single door refrigerator is highly suitable. I somewhere regret buying double door as I'm unable to utilize it to large extent. I recommend buying this refrigerator for multiple reasons as below.\n\n1) Back side covered, so doesn't look odd if you need keep the fridge around a living area.\n2) Storage : Optimal, for similar lifestyle like mine and with count up to 4-6 ppl.\n3) Although being single door, the space availability for regular food stocking is more than in my double storage option which is 235 litres and mostly wasted on top door which I use very less.\n4) Largely good built quality.\n5) Elegant look, I preferred plain grey self design. I think floral printed is also available.\n6 ) Using this since few months now, no much issues. So reliability as such presently assured by Brand name.",

            "The product is good and has decent looks. People looking for a single door refrigerator and inverter compressor should consider. One good feature is that unlike conventional refrigerators you can connect it to your inverter power. It uses power of two CFLs as the sticker says.",
            "Excellent product. Good value for my hard earned money. Along with it, Great service from Flipkart. Got the fridge the very next day of order, much before the scheduled.

            "Got the product delivered on time! Value for money,real good discounts from flipkart!\nThere was no mentioning that there wouldn't be installation from the service provider; Got this info by contacting the customer care. That was not satisfying.\nAfter the usage got to know that the side walls of the refrigerator gets heated up when checked on internet got to know that is normal as the condenser and evaporator are on the side walls... these information if provided in the specifications would help the buyer to make the right choice.\nOverall happy with the product and the price was really Good!!",
            "Overall it's a good product. But the size inside is bit small. The compartment are small as per 212L size, the size is like 190L to be true. Bottle keeping compartment is very big that 2.5L bottle can be fit. It's covered from back. No wire is seen from back. It have inbuilt stabilizer. You can go for this product as Flipkart is trust worthy along with good customer service and packing.",
