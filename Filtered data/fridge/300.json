            "Bought this refrigerator in big billion days delivered 2 days in advance and same day installation.\n\nI was using single door less than 200 L refrigerator. Motorola 592 L is not only spacious also looks elegant and I\u2019m very excited.\n\nThe smart wifi allows you to change controls through EZ smart Home app.\nFrost free works fine. The LED white lights covers each side and bright enough.\n\n2 movable ice boxes and a small ice tray. Double basket in the fridge and freezer give ample space to store.\n\nInitially when you switch on, the Inverter side of the fridge heats up and it\u2019s normal.\nFeather touch panels works fine except the child lock( need to wait 3mins to lock the fridge after you press lock button, never worked for me).",
            "Delivery is earlier than the mentioned date by Flipkart. Local delivery executive has given good support by all means. Exchange of my LG 9 year old Double Door Refrigerator was done smoothly. Got it at a very good price. Installation person visited within no time after delivery happened. Even though this refrigerator is the first to be seen by him in our location, he explored and given some demo and mentioned about the smart app to use in order to avail smart functions from our mobile itself. Product Quality is good, finishing also done a good job by Motorola. Spacing is well enough to place almost everything. As this is the first of its kind, we need to see the durability. Hope everything should be fine to use for longer years like LG.",
            "It is a very good purchase .. 592L of happiness..freezer and normal compartments work really well.. looks really classy and sometimes the heat gets dissipated through the side walls but that is common in all side by side refrigerators..silent performer.. very much recommended..",
            "Hai The Demo Team Should be More Knowledgeable So that they can give a proper Guidance...Child Lock how to enable it...How to use the Smart Wifi Application all should be done with proper Guidance and Knowledge...This is My feedback based on my experience",
            "Took a risk by buying the Motorola refrigerator when compared to a standard Samsung or LG! But to my surprise, the refrigerator is great overall. The features, design and looks of the refrigerator is great! Cooling is extremely good and temperature can be controlled through wi-fi (app based). Refrigerator is deep black but has some designs on the upper part which does not look great at certain viewing angles. For now, extremely happy with the purchase at the price!",
            "Delightful with the Product, Awesome Space for everything. First to buy in the State, Hopeful everything goes fine with the Function and Running of the Product.",
            "Product is good for the price... Also cooling is good.. however few cons i noticed are below:\n\nFridge sides get heated up some times, as per engineer this is normal.\nIn the freezer section i see a thin level of ice being formed, being a frost free model don't think this is a normal behaviour..\n\nApart from this product works well",
            "Product looks awesome and delivered as expected.exchanged my old refrigerator for best price Thanks a lot for that..Installation is bit intresting. The guy who did the installation , it is his first-time for this product. He just unpacked and plugged in. He is not aware of any of the product functionality.dissappointed with that.otherwise pretty happy with the product. Side walls of the refrigerator were too hot soon after switching on for few hours, then it does become normal. Build quality is more than good and recommend.",
            "The product is just fine from the day of its purchase, the look is nice, the feel is good and the cooling is just great. The only downside that I'd say is the overheating of the side panels, not sure if this is how it feels with any side by side refrigerator or Motorola is the exception. Would be nice If Motorola could expand their after-sales technical support base and send knowledgeable technicians for inspecting the performance of the product atleaset for the 1st year of its purchase.",
            "I bought this refrigerator recently and I must say I'm quite impressed so far. The delivery and installation was on time, as promised. They delivered it on the 2nd floor but I had to take the assistance of a few neighbors, so be mindful of that. Coming back to the refrigerator, the touch screen is easy to use and performance has been good so far but the long term reliability is something I'd like to see. If the product manages to last as long as some of the competitors like Samsung and LG i don't see why this wont be selling like hot cakes :) There is ample space for fruits, veggies and other stuff and you can set the temperature either manually or through the smart mode. You can also connect the refrigerator to your phone and control the temperature from your bedroom easily in case you forget to do it. All in all I'd say it's worth looking at considering it costs almost 20k less than the competition.",

            "It's a great product. Pretty new in the market but it's robust with great configuration, can change and adjust the temperature manually as well as via an app as well. Great design, look and a very sophisticated product and rich in class and looks",
            "We are using this product from last two months. Perrformance wise absolutely awesome, happy with the storage and installation process. Only one improvement area is motorola can work on looks wise.",
            "Doesn't look that premium, if it was a glass panel it would look super sexy. There are some issues with fit and finish. Both door are not properly aligned and over all outer body is ok Ok not that good\n, delivery personnel doesn't have much knowledge about the fridge, it is very difficult to use display. Cooling is very good and there is enough space to fit one more shelf but they didn't provide that. And also company has not provided any information regarding electricity consumption.",
            "Writing this review after a week of use. The product is a marvel! Worth every penny. Looks amazing, works like a dream. The installation wasn't upto the mark. The installation guy had no idea what he was doing. He was more interested in clicking selfies of himself with the product installed, face mask and sanitizer. I found the need for additional shelves and emailed Motorola for the same. Unfortunately even they have no idea and asked me to contact flipkart. Would have given 5 stars if additional shelves were sold separately.",
            "Product is good but we needed more shelves for refrigerator. We tried to get the information on the same from Flipkart and Motorola but no positive response. Both informing to contact other. Really miserable. How can a product success in market without accessories / spares clarity. Purchased due to name of Motorola and services of Flipkart BUT highly disappointed.\nHope somebody from their end should read this and contact me",

            "Giving Reviews after 6 month use, working perfect , frost free also working good, wifi enabled , you can use ezhome app to control this from anywhere . No heating issue 100% satisfied with this product",
            "Flip kart send me damage product and it's material quality si totally poor and when I rais request for refund they refuse and also can not return product its technical person say this is big refrigrator so it's got damage during transportation is normal so it's door not close properly we have to push door after it's close and door material is very chip quality plastic.\nTotally west of money\nDon't buy",
            "Delivery and time is very good but installation and demo technician is very bad and irresponsible and the product is worth for money more than we expect",
            "Worse refrigerator, my normal fridge sides makes ice ( not freezer I repeat) and company engineer is not able to solve problem. Please don't buy this company fridge, unless you want headache. Please go for Samsung or LG only",
            "Price little hai but product excellent",

            "Motorola 592L Side by Side Refrigerator is a value for money purchase. Quick delivery as promised, and installation on next day by Jeeves was quicker than promised. Just reviewing after 24 hrs of usage, Cools faster, even though it is 592L. Connecting to Wifi was a snap and the app did recognize it quickly too. Just entered the world of connected Home Appliances. Hope it will not disappoint.\nThank You Flipkart/EKart/Jeeves !!\nNote: Still disappointed that Ekart did not take my old working Refrigerator in Exchange, as it had rust on the door. Those who are interested in exchanging please go through the terms and conditions carefully. They only take back Appliances in near perfect conditions.",
            "Absolute value for money. Huge storage capacity for this price with wifi enabled features. Got this for lowest price during big billion days offer. Delivery was great as the delivery guys carried successfully to first floor.",

            "Poor design. Poor quality. No proper fitting tray, non convertible.",

            "Very good side by side fridge. Though side does gets hot .and the back remains at room temperature. Child lock means just control lock and not door lock. It can fit in 176.5 and above space",
            "Sides are generating too much heat which is very harmful specially for kids\n\nService persons do not know anything about the product,\nI am trying to return this product, so far flipkart is not cooperating",

            "Product warrenty by Jeevs not motorola. No extended warrenty by company. Extended warrenty to be purchased from Jeevs only.. In case you want to buy extended warrenty buy while placing the order as after purchasing the product you cant buy extended warrenty too. Very funny part is motorola has no control on Jeevs. seems like motorola is a cheap chinese brand.",

            "Worst",
            "Delivered the product on time and the delivery person have are very supportive, I would suggest not to wait for the installation person it's waste of time becouse the person dose not know anything about this product and 0 knowledge. It's to early to give a feedback about the performance, With one week experience i found the refrigerator is generating little bit heat I would say there is no noise. Nice product from motorola with excellent design and the space. Need to wait for the performance.",

            "Good to have this product in this price range... however I would still recommend to go for LG at an additional cost.",
            "I have purchased this Product during big billion day sell and i think so it is value for money. I kept faith in name \u2018Motorola\u2019. I hope company will give best service in future. Because now a days customers oriented business model is in focus. For that it is early to say about this company. Hope company will focused on this point.",

There was one leg missing and they were not ready to take the product back. After long discussions and waiting for around 1 hour. They accepted to take it back. Very bad behaviour!!
