If I keep the dial at <5,the freezer fills up with ice very quickly and the ice free section also gets frozen. If I keep it at 4 or less, ice cream melts but ice formation does not stop. Also, the defrosting is too slow, I need to manually remove big chunks of ice both inside the freezer section and around it. Storage is big enough, for 2 people. There is just one temperature regulator for both the sections,that is a big problem. All in all,it's good enough for the price.",

It has some metal covering over the compressor and refrigerator totally stand on it from the back.Front legs are adjustable but not at all practical as you can see in the picture one leg is behind one is in front.It took us an hr to set the refrigerator on stand. One star down due to this big blunder.\n\nOverall a power packed performer.\nDoes it's job fabulously you just need to adjust it properly before using and get used to it's old school style looks and features,then you can enjoy the chills :)",

            "Firstly, The Refrigerator came with only 2 front legs as stand and at the back the tray below compressor is touching the floor that means water cannot pass through it at least the product should be developed with 4 legs and a gap of 5cm should be there from floor. To curb this Whirlpool should give free stand with this.\n\nSecondly, Now a days all the Refrigerators come where Radiating Find and Coolant Tubes are covered by steel pack body so no need to clean that from dust which is a hectic task so by concluding above 2 points I will never suggest any Friends or Relatives to buy this refrigerator.",
