            "// What I Like Most? //\n1) Double door fridge with a convenient button control panel and with a 3 star energy efficient rating is an amazing deal. Nearly consumes 195 units per year, very economical.\n2) Cooling is very good, you need to set freezer temperature at optimal settings for ice making. Within 1.5hrs it is making ice, which is good. For the fridge 1 to 7\u00b0c has been given at the outdoor, 3\u00b0c is enough throughout the year, at summer peak times you need to set it at 1 or 2\u00b0c.\n3) Power Cool option is working good, it automatically turnoff after 2.5hrs. This will helps to cool very quickly.\n4) Coolpad is working good, helps alot while power cuts. I checked, it almost keeps the cooling retained for about 6 to 8 hours. Cool pad is removable, so you can remove it in order to expand storage space.\n5) Supports inverter technology, hassle free from powercuts and it connects to inverter with ease.\n6) During powercuts settings has been stored in memory, so no need to set settings again and again after getting power.\n7) Easy slides is very helpful, vegetables and fruit storage compartment are well designed and controls moisture very well.\n8) Auto defrost option is working very effectively.\n\n// Neutral? //\n1) Build quality is average, neither too good nor too bad, just okay for the price. Expected a bit more quality plastic setup comparing with the other brands.\n2) Space organising is not that good, just okaish. Way better if they could design this in a right way. Brands like Godrej and LG are way better in space organising.\n\n// What I Didn't Like? //\n1) You cannot accommodate 2.25 litres bottle in tall bottle gaurd rack, even a single door refrigerator can accommodate it with ease. (Pics added)\n2) Ice maker is good at design which is placed at the bottom, but it takes lots of space, we can move it sideways or can remove it but cannot shift it to the cool pad.\n3) Bottom bottle rack is very small, it is not accommodating 1 litre bottles of particular sizes, you need to add rectangle shaped bottles, so that it can accommodate. (Pics added)\n4) No light in freezer compartment.\n\n// Verdict //\nApart from design and little bit of storage issues, cooling was excellent, I will definitely recommend this product.\n\n// Overall Rating //\nDesign and Looks - 4/5\nQuality - 3.5/5\nStorage Space Organising - 2.5/5\nCooling - 5/5\nEnergy Efficiency - 5/5\nPrice - 5/5",

            "The model that I ordered was Frost free Refrigerator.\nThere are two models which look very similar, however the difference that I found was with the buttons in front. This one has just a button for power cool and the temp buttons (pic uploaded). Until it works, I have no issues with the buttons.\nThough it has 3 stars the unit consumed is very less (pic uploaded)\nDelivery took just one day. Just next day in the afternoon the installation guy came, opened and installed the refrigerator.\nI am very satisfied and happy with this purchase.\nThank u Flipkart.",
