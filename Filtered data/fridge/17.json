            "REVIEW AFTER 10 MONTHS. Please dont buy this fridge. I upgraded from our old lg to this one, because of the trust i had from the old fridge. but after 10 months, th fridge is not cooling properly, ice is getting builtup inside, and technicians cant findout the issue even after one week of trying. They are asking to turn off the fridge and manually defrost it. Please dont WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY on this model. you will regret it hard time, just like me. lost all the respect for the company, because for a refrigerator if it develops complaint in the warranty period itself, then the replaced parts wont live long enough and problem will return after few months. First i wasted th money by buying this fridge, and now i am going to waste more by repairing it. Learn from others mistake, save your money. thanks",
            "Value of Money.on time delivery. very nice.",

            "It's designed poorly. You can keep anything useful in the bottom-most tray in the door.\nYou need to stoop to see what's in the top rack because of the protruding freezer door. This can be fixed by using a stand. I think.",
            "Bigger Brand makes bigger sound just like anything fallen from top.Not expected atleast from LG.\nCooling & storage ok for 260 ltr but two main problems are sound comes from fridge & there is no light in upper section which are major drawbacks.\nI am going to complain about of this to LG.\nFlipkart delivered on time and it's business overs there.",
            "Im writing the review after 1month.\nLooks like the fridge is little small than usual fridge. When we use convertible option the upper part is not that much get cooled by machine.\nOne very big disappointment with this fridge is when its turn off automatically that time it make loud and mechanical sound. I dont know is this is acceptable scenario or my machine has a diffect?",

Further review will be posted after 3 months of usage.\nDelivered the item as per the schedule by Flipkart. But With regard to Installation very very poor response from both Flipkart and LG. I installed LG App and requested for installation. But no response. They took 3 days time to install it.\nIn fact, we ourselves can install it but for the Damage/ Non-functional if any and warranty purpose we have to wait for the LG installation service.\nExcept the Installation issue, I am very much satisfied with the item and functioning.",
