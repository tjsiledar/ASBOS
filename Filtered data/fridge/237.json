            "It has very good finishing (door design), plus one thing have noticed that if i compare this with my previous Godrej refrigerator it had few advantages\nPros:\n1. door size is very thick, so from long term point of view its good as we keep big bottles on door pocket containers it will easily bare its weight\n2. Individual cooling vary option for both doors\n3. Capacity is good + plus cooling system is awesome....., have noticed the freshness of vegetables remains as it is , previuosly it use to get dry after few days\n\nCons:\nOnly 3 sections are present inside for lower door section, they should provide 1 more dividing plastic layer which user might use it for optional purpose\n\n\nOver all -\n1. its very awesome product\n2. delivery guys are very much helpful (5 star for them)\n3. flipkart services (5 star) - you no need to call or mail them up , they keep on following things until you are done with final demo session",

            "It has very good finishing (door design), plus one thing have noticed that if i compare this with my previous Godrej refrigerator it had few advantages\nPros:\n1. door size is very thick, so from long term point of view its good as we keep big bottles on door pocket containers it will easily bare its weight\n2. Individual cooling vary option for both doors\n3. Capacity is good + plus cooling system is awesome....., have noticed the freshness of vegetables remains as it is , previuosly it use to get dry after few days\n\nCons:\nOnly 3 sections are present inside for lower door section, they should provide 1 more dividing plastic layer which user might use it for optional purpose\n\n\nOver all -\n1. its very awesome product\n2. delivery guys are very much helpful (5 star for them)\n3. flipkart services (5 star) - you no need to call or mail them up , they keep on following things until you are done with final demo session",

            "I bought this product last week, Flipkart delivery was on schedule & technician visit was scheduled the very next day. The product is very in terms of looks & design. The interior is quite spacious & the cooling is very fast. I compared refrigerators of other companies & could not find one that could match the price on this make & model. Godrej brand lives up to its expectations. A very good product at this price range.",

Product is intact, no damage delivered.\nEven delivery persons are too helpful & they place that 60 KG product to 1st floor & took the existing one back.Delivered in Good condition, Free demo & Installation has been done today.\nEven the price I have got from Flipkart which is less than any Distributor price. Overall I am satisfied with the product, very fast delivery & service too.",

            "Great product for the money. Good quick safe delivery service by EKART, and the service engineer came the very next day to carry out the installation. Always trust Flipkart for electronics.",
            "Very good product. FlipkFlipkart delivered within 3 days as mentioned at the time of order. And after delivery the installation also completed on next day of delivery. Product received with little damaged, but it didtn return because it's negligible(Flipkart also agree to return), so I like the way they approach for return & replace. I am using the product since last one month and have no any problems. Cons.:1. Little but open from backside so issue of rats, insects, etc might occur. 2. Very low noise of compressor. Good point: 1. Very good rates provided by Flipkart, compare to others. 2. Good prompt delivery. 3. Good installation service even though on Sunday by Jeeves.",
            "super double door fridge from Godrej in low budget. makes ice cubes very fast, super cooling. i am very much satisfied with this product",

            "Good buy. Delivery and installation happened as committed. So far good and having no issues. Do not look at buying any stand without checking with the installation person since the stands we see online are not recommended by them to withstand the weight and may also not fit properly.",

            "Wonderful product.",
            "Looking good and excellent performance",
            "Do not buy any white goods from flipkart would be my advice. They are selling factory discarded defective products. The fridge we received is making big noise from compressor. We wanted to return this defective noisy product but Godrej it seems is hand in glove with Flipkart. They told us that the noise level should not exceed 60 decibels and fridge is emitting 56 db. 60 decibels itself is a very high value in the house. And that is deliberately set this way so that defects can be covered up.\nIn a nutshell flipkart is a willing conduit for sale of defective, factory rejected products and by companies wishing not to accept their mistakes.\nDo not buy this fridge or any other from flipkart.",
            "Very nice products and big discounts",

Much spacious in comparison with other refrigerator in this range/volume. You will love it at first sight. After 15 days of use nothing adverse noticed. Automatically disconnects for frost free. All adjustable racks which can be customized as per your requirement. No stabilizer required. Overall a good purchase. I forgot to use No EMI option. Exchanged old one at a cost of 1800.

            "The Freezer compartment is too big could have been made smaller and same size as old Direct cool 166L ones. Hardly anyone makes ice cream and most Indians are Veg and don't require to store meat. Why not some brand make virtual Freezerless Refrigerators (just a very miniature compartment only to accomodate icetray). It would become most popular and sure winner. Time to make Vegetarians design Fridge compartments",

But thay could be in the initial stages when it is set to quick freeze mode for 24 hrs initially.\nUsed for 1 month and find if fantastic\n28 feb 2020: fridge no longer cooling.

            "Now a days godrej products became very light and losses its old sturdiness. I would recommend to have a look in show rooms first and decide. The fit and finish is just average in terms of cost cutting and it took 20 days to deliver and more over no service p\u00e9rson will come for installation. Very worst customer service support. They expect to install and use it with yourself. Just believing the motor would at least come for 10 years as it has warranty... Rest all very poor accessories and will not withstand even for 2 years...",
            "Though it has built in stabilizer, it can't handle more load(power fluctuations)...We need to buy external stabilizer if you have to have good life.. Within 8 months of purchase this fridge got damaged.. then Godrej service person checked and told us to buy external stabilizer as inbuilt one can't withstand more loads.. better buy a fridge without built-in stabilizer and install a new stabilizer..",

            "Good",
            "The product was delivered within 1 day after booked. The packing and delivery was neat and have no comment on their part.\nRegarding the product, it made of cheap plastic. The storage panel in the door is not quite conformable to hold multiple water bottles.\nThe place where the compressor is placed is not sealed. Also there are wires, visibly seen around that open area. If you have rats / cockroach in your house, you should be very cautious.\nThere is no issue with the cooling (both the compartments). Though all the racks were mentioned as \"Toughened Glass\", the beading around the glass is of very cheap plastic. Not sure if they can hold 150kg (as advertised).\nThe entire fridge doesn't looks like a 343L fridge (may be I replaced this fridge from 420L).\nThere is no issues so far with the fridge performance.\nAlso Flipkart and the seller did a good job in delivering on-time. The same with courier service too.\nThe installation guy just came to un-pack the cover and switched on the fridge. He did nothing more that.",
            "Great product. Only a bit of concern is no light in freezer door, but its not a big deal. Quick chill, led lights, and much more. By the way quick delivery by flipkart.",
            "Gud",
            "No major functionality issues with the product, however the overall experience of buying a refrigerator online was pathetic. Issue started when we first opened the door panel of this fridge. The design layout which we saw in the advertisement on Flipkart was different. We called up flipkart helpdesk and they arranged for technician visit from godrej. Seller and godrej both confirmed that the product and its model both are manufactured as per the design specifications and there is nothing that they can do. They were right on there part. It was Flipkart fault to post pictures which were miss leading. Later Flipkart did gave us an option to return the item however, we decided to keep the refrigerator as we got the same u through hefty discount offered on flipkart. Now we have got accustomed to the layout of fridge.",

            "Flipkart selling second hand goods. No wonder product price was lesser. The fridge is a old one came to know while cleaning, at the bottom the fridge is completely damaged and its if rats have eaten the bottom of the fridge. Unfortunately came to know after the replacement period. Overall the fridge is not having a single scratch but who expects flipkart will do such things.\n\nAfter taking up with flipkart they say they can't take my issue as I have crossed the replacement period. How does it a make difference if a customer comes to know if he has a got a defective product after few weeks or months.\n\nIf customer has not damaged the product and there is no tampering, how does it matter when the customer is complaining. why can't they send someone see what is the issue and if customer is not at fault, why can't they take action.
