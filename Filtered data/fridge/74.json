Cooling is consistent and maintains cooling of around 6-7 hrs even after switching off with less frequent door opening. Outer body is upto the mark, only thing I suggest to manufacture is to make slightly larger power cable. Power consumption is very less, there is hardly any increase in electricity bills, proving it a true 4S, I will recommend to buy this awesome appliance.",
