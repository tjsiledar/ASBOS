            "Same day installation and demo on the delivery.\nThe technician was available in our locality so luckily got it done.\n\nFirst day review. The cooling is amazingly fast.\nSpacious indeed. More than satisfactory for a family of four. Should check how the power consumption so far is. The blast freeze option is amazing. Ice cubes formed within 30mins.\n\nWill update the review after a month of usage.\nI'd say go for it.\nBecause it's the only five star rated tripe door fridge in this price segment.\n\nUPDATE AFTER THREE MONTHS OF USAGE :\nElectricity bill in our house use to be around 1.8k a month on an average. After switching to this refrigerator, it's lowered down to 1.1k per month. A significant change. Adding to this fridge's power saving, I did change all of my house lightings to 10W LEDs too. Significant saving of an average of 700rs per month on electricity bills.\nIt's the best fridge at thus price segment. More than enough for a family of four.\nSatisfied. \ud83d\udcaf",
            "This fridge is really the best at low prices from United States Brand's - Whirlpool. I believe it's really hard to get a good brand of another brand at this price. Its design and its quality are really stunning and superb. It can not be compared to other brands. Simply Awesome!\n\nMy Thought About Refrigerator:\n\nOn a very local scale, a refrigerator is the center of the universe. On the inside is food essential to life, and on the outside of the door is a summary of the life events of the household.",
            "all are happy in our family . we got a wonderful refrigerator at affordable price.. thanks whirlpool\nn a big thanks to flipkart because of flipkart we brought our desired refrigerator at a good price..\nhighly recommended..\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc98\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc93\u2764",
            "Amazing refrigerator with triple door cooling\nfacility. \ud83e\udd17\nIt's very spacious and the design is fantastic. The most remarkable feature of this refrigerator is the ice tray which is having a regulator to collect the ice cubes.\nI am fully satisfied with this product!!!\ud83d\ude00\nThank you Whirlpool and Flipkart !!\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a",
            "I think this is the best in its class. I bought it to my village and Flipkart delivered it in time and their is not a single scratch on the refrigerator. Kudos to Flipkart.\nThe benefits of buying the fridge online are\n1 Best price\n2 No need to arrange a Vechile to bring it home so no extra cost\n3 Timely delivery\n\nFinally my experience was very nice",
            "I will recommend this product.\nPros:\n\n1. Good three door fridge with separate space for vegetables, dairy products and water bottles.\n2. Low electricity consumption\n3. Good and attractive outlook, steel color is best\n4. Quick and good cooling\n\nCon:\n1. You can not convert freezer to ordinary refrigerator to store other stuff and make it large. Freezer is just an ordinary freezer.",
            "Installed 3 days back. Till now performance wise is great. I have purchased 240l capacity being small family. Cooling is very good at Normal level. All 3 compartments cooling is equally good. Will update my review after long use. Overall till now a great appliance if you are not looking for big brands. Value for money. And great service of installation by Flipkart and Whirlpool.",
            "Its a big refrigerator and spacious too. But the motor seems making some sound when there isn't enough power input. soft of like the sound a bike or car engine makes when it is going through a steep uphill road.",
            "Quite Happy with the delivery !\nThis fridge looks awesome !\nWaiting for the installation to be done.. i will update once the installation is completed..\n\nUpdate (20-02- 2017) -\nInstallation is done.. whirlpool guys were awesome..\nAnd This does not make huge noise..a little which is normal.\nI will update you once i get to know about power consumption..\n\nUpdate (15-03-2017) -\n\nAfter using this for almost a month..i can say that this does not use too much units.. just 1-2 unit/day (its normal)..\nSo no heavy power consumption ..\nLoving this product..",
            "This Refrigerator is Excellent. I bought this in Republic Day Sale in Offer. It's design is awesome and cooling features are mind-blowing. Space for foods and drinks are enough. I made Icecream to test its freezing point. Result is 10/10. I loved it's Steel Color. I got 10 years compressor warranty. Electric consumption is as low as an CFL light. Excellent product.

This three door product made even ozone friendly even by having isolated parts. The only con is it doesn't have large containing space inside as the size of the fridge looks big from outside but it's more than enough for a small family with three or four members. Family with 4 members may think this would be large for them but this is exactly for them but not for a family with more than four members.
