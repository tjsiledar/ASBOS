The product was delivered in excellent condition and the packaging makes sure protection against damage. Fridge is worth the money as it is one time investment and keeps food fresh as described. Excellent space capacity to stack up evrything you need. Very less noise you can almost not hear nything. Installation guy came in just 2 hours of delivery. This has been an awesome buy for me. You don't have to think twice to purchase this.",

Extremely satisfied with the service of Flipkart.",

Good cooling even at temperature of 47 degree in my city. you can store good quantities of icecream bricks, and other essentials like dry fruits etc in this fridge. It releases heat by only side walls .Back of the fridge remains cool. so you have no need to leave any space between back wall and refrigerator. you can put about 8 bottles of water and 3 large cold drink bottles at a time. The vegetables remain fresh as long as 5-6 days. but fruits can be placed for only 3 days maximum.",

A slightly bigger refrigerator chamber would have been great, though its depth compensates a bit !! full-marks to Omnitech for the prompt mapping of the product so that i could track its status very accurately. In fact product got delivered one day earlier than promised !",

This gets heated when you switch on for the first time ,for a few days and then cools down after use. the service in Chennai has been good and a minor problem in light switch ( got stuck) sorted out in a few hours . Initially the cooling was very good like a freezer in the refrigerator compartment, for a couple of months and that has come down . . May be that is how it is designed .",

            "Excellent product in this price range. It reached to me within 2 days of placing the order. It is working quietly since I bought it about fortnight back. I faced some problem with respect to occurrence of droplets in normal fridge section and asked Flipkart for exchange, which they did as Panasonic technician never visited to check if problem is minor or major. Full points to Flipkart here! So when technician again visited for the installation of the replaced fridge, he clarified that droplets is common occurrence and it is nothing to worry. I have also bought stabilizer to avoid any voltage fluctuation related damages. Although Panasonic claims that it is inbuilt but I did not want to take chances and so bought stabilizer also.",

            "I bought this product two years back, to be precise May 2019. The delivery and installation were fine, But after using it for two years, I had faced an issue. The refrigerator is not working, during a further investigation from the service team came to know the board was damaged. Since I had taken a 2 years extended warranty, I was eligible to get the damaged parts replaced. Then I started to follow up, recently came to know the parts are not available, thus they agreed to return back the refrigerator with cash in return while considering depreciation. I have lost the depreciation amount and extended warranty cost for a refrigerator which I have used only for two years. Now am waiting for them to pick up my damaged refrigerator.........",
