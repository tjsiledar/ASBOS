            "I must say that it came with very good packaging and the Samsung installation engineer visited the very next day for demo and installation of the fridge. The fridge has one super tiny dent on one of the sides which is not at all visible. There are No scratches on the front. The cooling and freshness is awesome. I really like this Samsung product. And I highly recommend this as the converter options are on the door and in the front itself with touch controls, unlike LG convertible refrigerators. How this review helps who\u2019s looking for a good double-door convertible refrigerator.",
            "Writing this review after a month of purchasing this, since this is convertible it gives us more space when freezer isn't required. Also the way it has got delivered to our place and next day the technician visit us for installation and demo , my family and I are all the more happy with this purchase and since it's coming from a brand like Samsung I know it's gonna last me long and service is gonna be good. It looks pretty good and has a lot of storage space for a family of 5 and a makeup hoarder who stores all her lipstick in the fridge \ud83d\ude1b",
            "It's too early to judge on fridge but overall quality seems to be good.\nBut installation provided by flipkart is not worthy hence reduced the rating.\nPerson who came for installation was from flipkart and less knowledgeable. He was carrying a stablizer which would work for tv and he was recommending me to buy.\n\nInstallation should be provided by Samsung, I still need demo from Samsung if flipkart can arrange it would be great",
            "The refrigerator was delivered in only 4 days and in the best condition possible. It's shiny and free of any sort of dents. Reading comments makes one feel little doubtful and so was I but surprisingly I received the best fridge at the best price and quality.\n\nThe fridge is installed yesterday and I will update about its functioning after 1 month.\n\nOne more guide is while buying any big equipments online, also check seller ratings.",
            "I am writing this review after 3 months and I must admit this that it has given a stellar performance. Great built, capacity and performance. Highly recommended !!! Thank you Flipkart \ud83d\ude0a",
            "I just love this. I was hesitant but now happy that I made the right choice. I am happy that I chose the 345 L model. It is so spacious and deep. However thanks to the steel front it looks like it takes up less space in my room than my smaller old fridge. I have used the fridge for a day. My comments below. I will update after a few weeks of use.\n\nThe delivery was a little delayed but it was exceptionally bad weather...so understandable. Delivery went smooth. Installation was the very next day. Went well.\n\n1. Looks good\n2. Deep shelves\n3. There is no door shelf opposite the veg basket so it is really huge which I love\n4. No chiller tray and a shelf instead which is what I prefer\n5. Solid strong shelves. Good solid feeling plastics\n6. Side is a kind of matte-finished metal like metal cupboards. Not unattractive. It would be weird to have a fully steel sci-fi like item in the room\n7. Controls are easy to figure out\n8. Ice making is quick\n9. Nice to have door shelves in the freezer also\n10. The ice maker that twists and empties into the ice bin is cute. Kids love it\n11. The sound of the fridge running was new and strange. I think I will get used to it. It's not louder than my old fridge, just different\n12. Since I do not use the freezer for most of the year, I love the ability to turn it off\n\nI'd say go for it!",
            "Delivered very late but product is very awesome best for 5-6 and also best for price,from all the Refrigerators this is very good and you will definitely notice it I am writing this comment after few months of experience so its a extremely very awesome\nYou should buy this product and no need to install any stabilizer , it's have very good stabilizer inbuilt and convertible features is also good........",
            "Good product, excellent packing. Delivery from earlier estimates. No dent/scratches found. The 43-inch UHD TV and refrigerator worked well over the past week. The overall experience is one step ahead of the showroom. The performance of the service engineer is also remarkable. LED TV and refrigerator are plugged together.",
            "Its superb. You can buy. No issues. Very much happy.",
            "Nice refrigerator, having big capacity with a benefit of converting freezer to fridge. Quick freezer as well as quick fridge modes are too good.\n\nSilent completely.",
            "Go For It",
            "All over the product was Good.",
            "Damaged product received. Even after replacement the body of the item was damaged.",

            "Samsung products is ok, but don't buy through flipkart, Samsung side support is ok, flipkart support and answer is absolutely poor,last quality, pl don't buth through flipkart",
            "Don't buy this fridge,this does not have much room than whirlpool 330 L. No chill tray, still having only holes for its door. Shelves can't be adjusted. Just given grooving only for sliding tray. THE WORST is that shelves won't touch the back wall, small containers will fall from top to bottom.",
            "Don't ever buy product from flipkart. I have received defective product.. And i have apply for replacement and its accepted but after 10-15 days my replacement was cancelled automatically and reason was unknown",
            "Good refrigerator, delivery was also quick and got next day installing but Delivery guy was rude.",
            "The delivery guys were very humble, they did full help for taking the fridge to the designated place. They did a complete physical check for any damage. Installation team was also cooperative and helped completely to understand the feature",
            "Product was good Delivery was on time but the installation guys never showed up they cancelled the installation on their own with out any update very disappointed with installation request flipkart to look into this for future",
            "Excellent, Good performance. Amazing colour luxe black.",

            "One of the best best Refrigerator",
            "Fridge is good.its working fine.only issue i had is they never take my old fridge as they are saying some silly excuses like sticker is not present.its an old fridge with more than 12 years but still with good condition and the person who does inspection also have no doubt with that.but they didnt find the sticker thats why they didnt take old fridge.when i check for old fridge requirement they didnt mentioned about sticker check.the person inspected is saying with out sticker he cannot confirm its having same capacity as i mentioned .this is not acceptable.there should be something else to check if we cannot find sticker as the sticker may get lost after 10 years so we cannot confirm about that.",
            "Water Pooling issue.",
            "Makes lot of noise. We first got a damaged product and later was replaced. After installation, we first got water sounds from it and then the compressor started making noise. Its halts for a while.and again restarts. The sound gets louder in nights. I would not recommend.",

            "Defective product",
            "In 60cms width this is maximum ltrs refrigerator, very useful for 2bhk homes.\n\nMy old samsung fridge also worked for 10 years without any issues. Power consumption also less and convertible option also very good.",

            "I purchased the refrigerator since it had exchange policy. But the delivery agent refused to take my old fridge during the time of delivery. The exchange policy mentioned in the Flipkart is a trick. I was forced to pay additional cost (Full amount) and the worst part is that I don't have enough space in my kitchen/ dining hall to keep 2 refrigerators. So, please don't go for an exchange offer; it is a trap.",

Since pandemic days and fear of covid-19 infection is haunting, I did not prefer to get it replaced or rejected. The functioning of the refrigerator, is however good. Since these days are cool and rainy, the real performance cannot be judged. I wait for summer to feel it's performance.",
            "Got the product within two days. Thanks to flipkart for the faster delivery. The product was fine no damages or dent it was in perfect condition. The service and demo team came after only two days so little bit upset regarding that.

            "Fully meets the expectations. Excellent design. The twin cooling feature is awesome and ensures that the freezer and refrigerator compartment cooling is independent. Convertible feature enables more flexible usage and energy saving. It's two months now of this purchase and am very much satisfied with its performance. It's very spacious but the space would have been much better utilized if option for one more shelf was there. Samsung refrigerators are anyway excellent. My previous refrigerator too was of Samsung, bought 20 years back and is still working quite satisfactorily. Flipkart delivery was prompt and was delivered in just two days and installed the next day. However, I am very much disappointed with the exchange service of Flipkart as it rejected the old refrigerator just because of a small scratch of the size of a pencil tip on the bottom of the refrigerator body. I don't know what they want in the old item. Should it be as good as a new one. And this is not the first time. Three years back too they had rejected my old washing machine on similar ground, though it was working perfectly and at that time they didn't had the policy of spot payment of the exchange value to retain the new purchased item and so they took back the washing machine despite my offer to pay the exchange amount. Fortunately, they have now changed the policy and this time I could retain the new refrigerator by paying the exchange amount of 3000. And just to point out the deliberate rejection of old items by their delivery person, I want to state that I was able to sell my old refrigerator at Rs 1000 more than what Flipkart was offering in exchange.",

The whole experience was a smooth one.",

            "A very good looking metallic finish. The display attracts attention. Has two more modes to turn off the fridge or freezer portion compared to 3 in 1 convertible model. Not so commonly used so you can look at 3 in 1 models to save money. Rather large in size at nearly 6 feet without stand. Too much storage for a 4-member family unless you plan to store pulses and foodgrains (which some people do, by the way). Convertible mode works flawlessly. Not much heating or sound. Door ajar sound is very useful as well.",
            "I got it for 30800rs best",
            "The video says that the fridge has a cooling pad in the 345 ltr model but that's not the case as it is available only at 324 ltr model. Flipkart should make sure not to use same video for both and cause confusion.",

            "Refrigerator is really good. Huge capacity, more power saving with 3 star. One thing I observed is when there is electricity cut off, the refrigerator setting resets to default and you again require to set to desired temperature. In case you have inverter this problem might not come in picture. Colour is not that cool. More designs should be made available in this category.\n\n\n1 star for Ekart transport service. I got damaged fridge at first after which I requested for replacement. The replacement took 10 days. The transportation guys were handling the new refrigerator badly and they struck it twice on ground. That caused bent to top side of replaced fridge. Very pathetic transportation service.",

Only complain is that their is a small like 5mm size dent in the back that too that was not noticed by me or my family but by the samsung installer , but i did not exchange the product . The person who brought the product were very helpful and had maintained proper hygiene and were wearing masks and gloves. The samsung installer called me on the day of delivery and was installed the next day. The product was delayed to me by 5 days but thats okay bcoz it was taken proper care and was transported in a 407 mini truck . Love d the product and am excited about it. Functioning is a breeze.\nSuch fridge gets warm along the sides , so that should be kept in mind. Thank u flipkart.",

I searched details from Samsung official website and got to know that there was no Coolpad. No freshroom but freshroom image in description. Samsung describes that freezer converted into freeze but in practical it maintains minimum cooling by freezer but still less than zero. If we switch off freezer,it doesn't switch off but cool air is coming out from vents, but no ice formation. Misleading information to some extent by Samsung. But performance is good.",
            "One star because, when the box is opened by technician there two areas covered with small tape, we just pulled off those and did not notice anything at that time but then after couple of hours we realized that these are put in place to cover scratches and a small dent.
