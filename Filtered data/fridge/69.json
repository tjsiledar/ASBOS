That was great!\nInstallation was scheduled on 9th however surprisingly samsung was good enough on follow up and Installed it on 6th June.\nComing to the product, the storage is ample and features are good enough for the price point. Looks are quite premium and the LED lighting is of awesome quality.\nThe product which I received was manufactured on January 2020 which is quiet latest.",
            "Overall Refrigerator is OK. Good for 3-4 persons family. Door alarm function is of no use as beep sound not audible. Cooling is really good specially for freezer. No noticable compressor sound. Power consumption not best but OK.Convertible feature may be useful at limited moments.Coolpack Coolwall marketing feature, useful in areas where power supply is issue. Build quality average. Color feel is shining blackish. Space between racks is low,big minus. Door lock function missing which is must if u have kids. Got next day delivery from Flipkart. samsung person explain feature via remote video calling (means self installation).",
