            "Awsome refrigerator for this price. Better build and features than branded ones. excellent packing.\nSize is very huge than expected.\nTouch temp control\nwater dispenser\nsimple back\nperfect design\nbody is heavy and build quality is excellent\nplenty of shelves\nvery quiet no sound even in full use.\nFirst use - I kept in full high cold and everything freezed in freezer . So freezer level low is more enough and i see Ice made in an hour even i kept low freeze. So awsome.\nAs per standard it is very low power consumption compares to branded ones as I see 1.1 unit per day for 560 ltr refrigerator is nice.\nWater dispensers child lock is useful as children will operate simply.\nTemp child lock is nice feature, you can lock temp levels as it may be changed by children. Easy to operate touch control.\nEasy to move over the floor as it has wheels and you can lock movement with stand lock, wrench for operating stand lock is provided in kit.\nAdding this after usage a month. There is no power bill change it is very low consumption as my old 265 ltr refrigerator. So the power consumption is saving compared to other brands. Highly Recommended refrigerator in SBS sector",
            "We had a 266L refrigerator but this Diwali we thought of gifting ourselves a bigger refrigerator. A SBS was out of question for us given the high prices asked but Marq was a boon for our ever increasing need.\n\nOrder and Delivery:\nI ordered it within an hour after it was launched and the delivery was made on the 2nd day of the purchase.\nIt took 4 men to lift it to our home on the 1st floor. I'd advise people to only order this fantastic piece of appliance if you have a wide staircase or a lift.\nThe product is well packaged with well designed cardboard material.\n\nInstallation:\nIt was done barely 2 hours after the delivery. Since it was the first MarQ refrigerator delivered in my city, the representative from Jeeves was as clueless as me. Fortunately he had a installation video which he promptly shared.\nThe first thing during installation I'd suggest you to do is to make sure you lift the front legs of the refrigerator by turning it with your hand so that it stays in place as it has wheels on all 4 sides before using the refrigerator.\n\nOperation:\nOperation of the refrigerator is super easy. It's silent and doesn't vibrate at all. The doors are smooth to open and close. The LED lights are bright and light the whole compartment. The water dispenser has a capacity of 3 litres. It initially takes about 6 -24 hours for the refrigerator to reach the required temperature so do wait to evaluate its performance. Also, only the side walls (adjacent to doors) dissipate heat, thereby, requiring space for ventilation on the sides.\n\nValue for money?\nDefinitely yes. I don't think one can get a better deal than this. Go for it!\n\nMissing information?\n1. No information available on the weight load factor of glass shelves.\n2. No info if it has an inbuilt stabilizer as most refrigerators do.\n\nConclusion:\nIf I have to buy a refrigerator again I'd go for it without any second thoughts. It has a water dispenser which only a SBS with a price tag of upwards of 70+K has. Not only has it saved me money but its also a big space saving for me as we don't have to keep anymore bottles. It's silent. It's huge and it's presence is felt.\n\nP.S. - The display panel is different as shown by Flipkart than the one I received. But that's okay, it has the same functions and design (but a white light would have been my personal preference). Also the manual has a lot of grammatical mistakes and errors. But that shouldn't be spoiling your decision whatsoever :-D",
            "Hi,\n\nThe opinions after usage of a month.\n\nBest things:\n1. The price - bang on, affordable and well built. At this price point, i bet a proper good normal refrigerator would come.\n2. The looks - super trendy, a definate peice of praise\n3. The features - The description fits perfect with this product. The fridge is divided into 60:40 for fridge to freezer ratio. NO FROST as promised as a USP.\n4. Color available is only grey and it looks ubercool.\n5. Simple to use control panel\n6. Chilled water dispenser - yes, you guessed it correct, the water tank is placed inside and is to be MANUALLY filled. Tank is 10-13 ltrs.\n\nDidnt like:\n1. Flipkart sent only 3 persons to transport the fridge, if u have an appartment, you will face a hard time transporting it to upper floors.\n2. I just wish the freezer was convertible, so that the parts which is not being used as a freezer, could have been used as a fridge. However, somehow, the refrigerator only ices the products its supposed to, else things like sauces and pastes never gets iced, but reaches to much lower temperatures just before ice.\n3. I wish there cud have been 1 or 2 colors available.",
            "Best and awesome product by flipkart. features are too good and easy to use. installation and demo was done on the same day of delivery. worth the money. as usual on time safe and sound delivery by flipkart. instead of paying Lakhs for other models like LG and Samsung, better go for this. u will never regret",
            "The Best Side By Side Frost Free Refrigerator that come in very affordable price by Flipkart's Marq the best part in this price range it has water dispenser.......the LED Panel is color different that's it.....we just love it love Flipkart for the delivery and installation it's very fast and reliable.",
            "It's a very very good product . And their installation is also to good Mr amit and rajendra explained us the features and its a good product . It's performance is also too good and it's design is just too good .",
            "lovely gift which we presented to our family.... with lot of skeptical thoughts we chose to go ahead with this but as of now it has met all our expectations... super quick ice... we need to have more ice trays, which we bought as extras.... nice asthetics with an option of maintaining temperature of both sides... the water dispenser holds uptown 2.5-3 lit of water... which is adequate for a family of 4 as we normally jus use a Lil bit of it with normal water...",
            "Awesome product... Good design, Good quality, quick cooling and auto cut off, zero noise, quick delivery, custom adjust for freezor and fridge, movable product, water dispenser and overall superb, but very worst for demo man, he doesn't know about this side by side refrigerator and he is first time seeing and don't know about it and nothing helped to about my queries and doubts. Thanks to provide atleast user manual..",
            "Just the kind of fridge that I wanted ...\nSpacious, excellent cooling and freezing....\nValue for money... 100%\nQuality is good of both inside and outside..\nI'm glad I chose a new brand MarQ instead of the regular brands... It was worth the risk and I am absolutely happy... Thank you MarQ\nPs... I bought a microwave of the same brand.\n\nPS... The delivery person damaged my gate while unloading the fridge... Cost me a bomb to fix it... Hence such late review...",
            "MARQ Refrigerator is installed today but service engineer did not explained properly all the features.. He was in hurry and wanted to run away. On phone he said that simply plug in your power supply and refrigerator is on. No need of my coming. Moreover Stabilizer is required compulsory whereas FLIPKART has never suggested for stabilizer installation.\nDemo was not given properly, how water dispenser will work etc not explained by Service Engineer properly as he was in hurry and ran away in 7 minutes.\nIt is suggested to FLIPKART to take care of services provided for demo and installation by respective service Engineer. He was very rude, non-courteous and in hurry as if he was obliging for demo and installation of MARQ Refrigerator.",

            "We had a 266L refrigerator but this Diwali we thought of gifting ourselves a bigger refrigerator. A SBS was out of question for us given the high prices asked but Marq was a boon for our ever increasing need.\n\nOrder and Delivery:\nI ordered it within an hour after it was launched and the delivery was made on the 2nd day of the purchase.\nIt took 4 men to lift it to our home on the 1st floor. I'd advise people to only order this fantastic piece of appliance if you have a wide staircase or a lift.\nThe product is well packaged with well designed cardboard material.\n\nInstallation:\nIt was done barely 2 hours after the delivery. Since it was the first MarQ refrigerator delivered in my city, the representative from Jeeves was as clueless as me. Fortunately he had a installation video which he promptly shared.\nThe first thing during installation I'd suggest you to do is to make sure you lift the front legs of the refrigerator by turning it with your hand so that it stays in place as it has wheels on all 4 sides before using the refrigerator.\n\nOperation:\nOperation of the refrigerator is super easy. It's silent and doesn't vibrate at all. The doors are smooth to open and close. The LED lights are bright and light the whole compartment. The water dispenser has a capacity of 3 litres. It initially takes about 6 -24 hours for the refrigerator to reach the required temperature so do wait to evaluate its performance. Also, only the side walls (adjacent to doors) dissipate heat, thereby, requiring space for ventilation on the sides.\n\nValue for money?\nDefinitely yes. I don't think one can get a better deal than this. Go for it!\n\nMissing information?\n1. No information available on the weight load factor of glass shelves.\n2. No info if it has an inbuilt stabilizer as most refrigerators do.\n\nConclusion:\nIf I have to buy a refrigerator again I'd go for it without any second thoughts. It has a water dispenser which only a SBS with a price tag of upwards of 70+K has. Not only has it saved me money but its also a big space saving for me as we don't have to keep anymore bottles. It's silent. It's huge and it's presence is felt.\n\nP.S. - The display panel is different as shown by Flipkart than the one I received. But that's okay, it has the same functions and design (but a white light would have been my personal preference). Also the manual has a lot of grammatical mistakes and errors. But that shouldn't be spoiling your decision whatsoever :-D",
            "Hi,\n\nThe opinions after usage of a month.\n\nBest things:\n1. The price - bang on, affordable and well built. At this price point, i bet a proper good normal refrigerator would come.\n2. The looks - super trendy, a definate peice of praise\n3. The features - The description fits perfect with this product. The fridge is divided into 60:40 for fridge to freezer ratio. NO FROST as promised as a USP.\n4. Color available is only grey and it looks ubercool.\n5. Simple to use control panel\n6. Chilled water dispenser - yes, you guessed it correct, the water tank is placed inside and is to be MANUALLY filled. Tank is 10-13 ltrs.\n\nDidnt like:\n1. Flipkart sent only 3 persons to transport the fridge, if u have an appartment, you will face a hard time transporting it to upper floors.\n2. I just wish the freezer was convertible, so that the parts which is not being used as a freezer, could have been used as a fridge. However, somehow, the refrigerator only ices the products its supposed to, else things like sauces and pastes never gets iced, but reaches to much lower temperatures just before ice.\n3. I wish there cud have been 1 or 2 colors available.",
            "Best and awesome product by flipkart. features are too good and easy to use. installation and demo was done on the same day of delivery. worth the money. as usual on time safe and sound delivery by flipkart. instead of paying Lakhs for other models like LG and Samsung, better go for this. u will never regret",

It was worth the risk and I am absolutely happy... Thank you MarQ\nPs... I bought a microwave of the same brand.\n\nPS... The delivery person damaged my gate while unloading the fridge... Cost me a bomb to fix it... Hence such late review...",
            "MARQ Refrigerator is installed today but service engineer did not explained properly all the features.. He was in hurry and wanted to run away. On phone he said that simply plug in your power supply and refrigerator is on. No need of my coming. Moreover Stabilizer is required compulsory whereas FLIPKART has never suggested for stabilizer installation.\nDemo was not given properly, how water dispenser will work etc not explained by Service Engineer properly as he was in hurry and ran away in 7 ...\nREAD MORE",
            "A great product.\nVery happy with one day delivery of the product.\nBetter than some other brand costing almost double.\nYou might need a Stabiliser with the fridge.\nBuy V-Guard VG 100 stabiliser along with fridge.\nCooling is Fabulous and storage is very nice.",
            "It certainly deserves 5 star and infact more than that, ur neighbours are going to be jealous of you, this is huge and beautiful fridge and performance is absolutely superb, Delivery and installation time was super quick, installation person was quick in installing but only thing missing was his knowledge about fridge, he doesn't know how to operate touch panel and other features, rest everything is awesome, better than any other brand refrigerators. Keep your eyes close and go for it.\n\nIts been more than a year now and performance is still excellent, nothing like it. Once again recommending it to 100%.",
            "Best side by side refrigerator in budget. It\u2019s a Flipkart Brand. Energy efficient, huge space and classic look. No other refrigerator can give you water dispenser in this budget. It\u2019s a classic budget side by side refrigerator",
            "This is the best refrigerator in this price range. Its beats all the Samsung's and whirlpool and LG refrigerator in this 550 ltr capacity. And price wise its half of their price. Offers more than big companies. Writting this review after 4 months of use and it is giving flawless performance",
            "I would only tell the -ves since you can read the +ves in all reviews.\n\n1. Sides get very hot in summer. Almost like soup in a 5 star hotel hot.\n2. Water drips in the non-freezer zone at the top. ( water = 3-5 drops per day)\n3. Fridge needs 3-4 days to work properly after installation.\n4. Finger print magnet\n5. Extremely heavy but easy to move because of wheels.\n\nAfter considering all the above points its still a good buy.",
            "flipkart had delivered the product ontime and with very good packing condition. Quality and finish of the product is very good at this price. Demo provided by jeeves was also on time. overall iam satisfied with the product.",
            "The fridge is awsome and works perfectly without any complaint from the last 12 days.Those looking for a better range refrigerators must go for this as this refrigerator is providing the same features as in 80k fridge.The thing is that marq doesnt have exclusive outlets that is why its price is little less but i dont see any compromise with build quality.Value for money extremely happy with the purchase.",
            "Using it fr last one week everything is fine nw. good product with more value. Water dispenser is my favourite feature in it. It provides AI mode in it. Its very good. Let me chek for more time n update my review. As of nw i m really satisfied for choosing this product.",
            "This product is absolutely awesome in terms of its looks, design, performance, volume and capacity. This has complete value for each penny. Truely like a must buy product.But the 3 delivery persons were terrible, just couldn't carry the product to my 2nd floor home in a single attempt citing narrow passage.I had to arrange for 3 outside labourers who handled with ease and delivered to my kitchen although I had to spend an additional Rs.600 for the same.The demo guy who came the next day was a rude, arrogant and equally horrible.Flipkart must show some professionalism and there's a lot more to in terms of delivery and demonstration",
            "Best price and best product no noise at all till now and good finished and good quality cooling is very fast also. But few more features shld be added in the next model of the product...",
            "Pros :\n\nNice product with having immense performance with providing the option to the user for setting the customised cooling temp.\n\nGreat design and colour template.\n\n560L capacity including the utilities for ice cubes and holders are good enough for the home usage.\n\nCons :\n\nHeating issue will be there at the initial usage, but it will be rectified after day to day usage.\n\nIt would have been better if any separate section for freezing is provided, apart from the open space in left and right sides.\n\nDelivery process is very bad and I've waited 1 week more than the expected delivery date. Installation got delayed as well.\n\n\n---\n\nIf brand name doesn't matters, then this is the best buy under this price range offering good performance with 560L capacity.",

Not much increase in my power though I moved from single door 240 liters to this double door big box.\nIf you really have a need to have this big then fine else the freezer is too big and we cannot convert it to regular fridge or shut it off though the power consumption is low and it doesn\u2019t matter to us.

They have given the contract to company named Jeeves who don't give a damn about the customer. Filed complaint so many time. They don't even bother to visit customer and mark the complaint complete while sitting at their place. On several requests they changed a sensor but the issue persisted.
