My earlier product was failed just in few months after expiry of warranty of 5 years. The fault was major and to much expensive. So, I have to dispose off it in scrape.

Works amazingly. Go for it if you're looking for a budget fridge. There are some cons. The plastic inside the fridge is of poor quality so handle with care. The gasket on the door is likely to be faulty. You will have to fix that if it doesn't close properly. It's wobbly, you'll have to get a stand or shove thermocol underneath it at the back.And the most annoying this is ice accumulating in the freezer all the time making it hard to close the freezer door. You have to defrost it every three or four days. Still a decent purchase. I recommend it.",
