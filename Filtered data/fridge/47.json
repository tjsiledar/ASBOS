Cooling is good. But if you're looking for a frost free refrigerator then it's not for you. You have to manually defrost it twice a week which is annoying becuase the water container which is placed at the back of the refrigerator above the compressor is non removable. It is difficult for anyone to take the water out from it.\n\nIf you don't defrost it manually then it will become some kind of glacier. Freezer becomes ice. Except this one thing, everything is good in this fridge. If that one issue I am facing is not a deal breaker then go for it. Better to go for a frost free refrigerator by paying few more bucks .",

Cooling is not evenly distributed.\nIf it's kept very high every two days we need to defrost the freezer orelse freezer will be damaged.\nIn medium mode freezers cooling is not satisfactory but foods are not getting spoiled.\nAlso it's not recommended to open the fridges many times because it's very large and single door fridge, power will b more and water drops are formed inside.",
