They came and told, my staircase is not big enough to take it up ( 2nd floor). When I insisted, they asked me to sign a paper which they are saying , it will make my replacement and warranty void (!!). I asked them to come next day, so that I will arrange some helpers.\nI bought a measuring tape, and measured the narrowest part of my staircase ( the U turn, about which , they complained). It was 70cm. The widest part of the fridge is 61.5cm ( + 7cm for Packing).\nThe next day, they came by 8.30am and I could not arrange helpers by that time. They reminded me about helpers and they wont deliver upstairs. I had a heated chat with them and I measured the box with my tape ( widest was 67 including package). So I told them, to bring it up and once it is stuck somewhere they can place it at that point and leave. Only two of them ( they were three , and I offered some cash on first day . they denied). Surprisingly( for them), the space was enough to keep the box upwards and turn and slide through the narrowest gap and they reached in my kitchen with the box in less than 5 mins!. Since I was in hurry to handle my morning pressure, i didnt want to state my ultimate win on their face. Just smiled and waved.",

            "Good the product deliveried by flipkart own delivery . No tips asked and brought without damage. Works well for last one month.\nPros\n1. Convertible so far checked to change the temp and it works. Did not change anything on it other then temp settings.\n2. Lower freezer and removable ice tray. Saves space when I do not want ice at all.\n3. Good cooling overall.\n4. Has wheels so easy to move.\n\nCons\n1. No freezer light\n2.No real handle, but handle craved out in the door.\n3. This model is not listed in Haier website. But you can get the same specs model from haier but that is costly by 2 to 3 k in market. I went for filpkart one as they had easy emi option. Else I would not have.\n\nOverall Good buy . Long term service ya reliability can't comment",
            "Awesome experience with Flipkart we are happy with the services and products as well All the best Flipkart team \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",
            "Really awesome product. Hats off to Haier for making such product. It's reverse structure allows more comfort compared to normal fridge while using. It's 8 in 1 convertible feature allows u to save more energy as well its capacity can be increased by using this feature. Price is in the same range as of normal fridge. Sound is almost no. I don't think any other fridge is available with such features at this price. Demo service was also good and timely. I got this deal on festive season. Last but not least thx to flipkart for proving this product at reasonable price. Handling & delivery of the product was safe and secure. The delivery person himself carried the entire fridge on his back and bring on the second floor. Too much thx to him also (sorry I didn't remember name). Lots of negative comments are flying regarding service of Gati courier. But their prompt service is something that should be praised. No issue. Yes delivery is little bit late (around 12-15 days) but this may be OK (the product is huge and of course handelling with too much care is not easy) as u are getting such product at the minimal pricing.",
            "Order processed and delivered on time , installation was so fast and they even changed the damaged bottleguard instantly . So happy to buy from flipkart and Haeir you are one of the best support",
            "Amazing product and great value for money.... only drawback Is that it has a normal compressor which makes more sound than the ones with advanced digital inverter compressor but it's lower price of Rs 16,500 as part of big billion days offer justifies it's features...it's competitor products of Samsung n other brands with similar features have their price starting from 20,000 and above.... convertible feature helps using the refrigerator efficiently and helps save power.. overall performance is mind blowing so buy it without hesitation..!",
            "Good product. Best we can get in this price range. The convertible option is great. Ample storage space. If you don't want a freezer, it can be easily converted to refrigerator.",
            "I wanted to wait a few days before I wrote a review and I must say that this fridge is just great. The exterior build quality is just too good and especially the doors are designed and built really well giving it that premium look and feel. Having the refrigerator section on top and the freezer section below makes a lot of sense and you dont have to bend and you have full visibility of all the items in the refrigerator. The quality of the interior glass and plastics are top notch.\nThe delivery by ekart was hassle free and they even I unboxed the fridge. The haier technician came by a few hours later and got the fridge installed and running. Overall a fantastic experience and a great product!!!",
            "Haier provides best product quality at very reasonable rate. It is future brand and manufactured in India in Pune.\nForget LG and Samsung that cost 50 percent higher to Haier products. I am fully satisfied with haier in terms of quality, service, rate and technology. Keep it up. Just Great.",
            "I'm writing review after 3 months. Im very much impressed with flipkart . They deliver on time and no damage.It came very safe, and fredge is awesome it don't make noise.Im Happy with Haier product",
            "An average product ! The refrigerator is cooling more than what is required, within 6 months I have to call 3 times. It's better to go with Samsung or LG which has a better experience. Haier it's time you need to fix things and make a better product for the price you are changing. I am upset that why I purchased your product.\n\nMy suggestion is that please do not buy this product !",
            "Excellent refrigerator... \ud83d\udc4cgood color, nice look, \ud83d\udc4c good product by haier and good service by flipkart \ud83d\udc4c \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4dthanks flipkart \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f",

            "Using it from a year now and it's working absolutely fine till date. I usually keep the freezer off and only use refrigerator. build quality of Ice cube box is not good and the spring came out after few uses.but it is a useless thing for me so I didn't care. light inside the refrigerator is very good and bright.\nFreezer is cool even when we turn it off.\nAlso smell from freezer travels to refrigerator section .\n\nAlso power consumption & noise is very less compared to my 190L old whirlpool fridge.\nFreezer can reach upto -22Deg c which is a great feature for storing fish.\n\nI got it at 17500 rupees only.no stand is required and you can directly keep the refrigerator on your floor by adjusting the feet.",
            "very good product. looking at now a days requirements it is ideal to have bottom mount fridge. this will reduce the back pain and easy access to your most need item on top fridge",
            "for 2 person family its more then enough capacity, cooling is good its functionality of different modes are something which needed for working class families, small for 5 person family below that its enough. cooling is super fast, installation also on time and quick, i am happy with this product.",

            "Firstly the product is of very good quality within this price range. Delivery and Demo given before the scheduled time which is very impressive.

            "Very well satisfied with the flipkart and Haier, although person who came for demo was more of imbecile who didnt know of any mode of functions. if I would have been illiterate, then i could have never been able to understand these function by his demo. I read it in fridge panel and understood on my own..\nHaier product excellent but demo staff must be clever unlike some imbecile sent to me...",
            "Haier Fridge - very happy with the purchase. The installation was done the very next day and it has been working fine since then. Happy that I opted to buy this fridge.",
            "Best refrigerator. Writing this review after using for 7 months. Great cooling effect in normal mode and also in Super freeze mode. Power consumption is less when using single compartment. Liked the touch panel controls and led display which feels premium. Refrigerator is very silent. Worth the money. Good delivery from flipkart.",
            "Haier products are usaually very nice in quality. Using 2 Fridge and one AC. Both are working fine. After sale service is the best part of the deal. Have personal experience, it is best among all.",
            "it's a good fridge with special convenience of bottom freezer. I didn't face any problem regarding sound or side walls getting heated. working like a charm. demo was quick..within 3 hours of delivery.\nonly drawback is it doesn't have sufficient racks in the door to keep bottles and other items. cramped space doesn't allow more than 1.25 ltr bottle.\noverall very good experience in this price range",
            "Nice refrigerator....... and thanks to flipkart for timely delivery...... the installation and demo was even prior to the date which was fixed while making order..... Thank you flipkart",
            "Beautiful look and very good cooling at and facility that gives you 8 type control thats why its calling 8 in 1 refridgerator i like to advised this product because you can put and take any vegy and milk without geting down you can work staight best facility that you can make full refrigerator ice you can convert full in refrigerator thanx for making energy efficient also",

            "Very good product . Best services from both Flipkart and Haier . Refrigerator has 8 in 1 mode and a very good mi com panel inside the fridge to convert settings. I recommend to buy this product. Latest model as manufactured in 2018 .",
            "Awesome product.\n\nSaw this in an offline store. Loved it and it didnt disappoint me. There is a black variant in this model which is fantastic looking. And it actually makes sense to have the freezer at the bottom. Simple yet effective idea :)",
            "In hindi it's said.... \" saste main mast \" .... Best build quality, timely delivery by flipkart and installation. Ideal for the family of 4 person. The convertible feature is awesome.",
            "Perfect and very good looking. Convertible options are worth the money as can be set as per need of cooling requirements. Super cool and super freeze option are added advantage when we need quick chill cooling during extreme summers. Also the compressor is very silent, no sound at all compared to my previous one which I had exchanged this with. Installation was even prompt within 3 hrs of delivery(just that I called Haier customer care from my end to schedule it without waiting for flipkart to arrange). Overall i am very satisfied with its performance and full paisa vasool purchase. Thanks Haier!!\nComing to delivery it was delivered within time n delivery man were very courteous and patiently delivered the product on 4th floor without any complaints or additional demands considering they also needed to carry back my old refrigerator down four floors..must say it was perfect delivery experience with total customer satisfaction..thanks flipkart!!",

Thank you.. And the price is very reasonable.",
