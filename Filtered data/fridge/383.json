            "So its been 50 days since I've been using it.\n\n* Its good enough for a single person if you do a lot of cooking and all.\n* Too early to report any issues or whatsoever.\n* Its really super silent as advertised. Previously got addicted to this videocon model buzzing sound that when I started using this, for the first day or a two, I was in a bit of doubt whether the fridge is operating or not!!\n* Just cleared the built up frost yes'day for the first time by disconnecting power and leaving the door open for around 5-6hrs.\n* The plug is 16A. There's no inbuilt stabilizer for this model. So I felt like its 'better safe than sorry' & got one VGSD 50 (8A) & it wont fit. Well I just sent it back and got VGSD 100 supreme model instead.\n* One noticeable problem is there is no convenient way to place normal size water bottles.",

Previously got addicted to this videocon model buzzing sound that when I started using this, for the first day or a two, I was in a bit of doubt whether the fridge is operating or not!!\n* Just cleared the built up frost yes'day for the first time by disconnecting power and leaving the door open for around 5-6hrs.\n* The plug is 16A. There's no inbuilt stabilizer for this model. So I felt like its 'better safe than sorry' & got one VGSD 50 (8A) & it wont fit.

There is one shelf for a 2 litre coke bottle , the other shelf has been designed shallow to keep chocolates or eggs etc so if your stand a water bottle it will topple over and the rest of the top and bottom shelves are good only for small beer cans and coke cans etc...so only place for water bottle is to place horizontal in the main shelves of the fridge...apart from this no other issue...good purchase...hope it lasts",

            "Good",
            "Good product for bachelors, small families on a budget, or students living in hostels or dorms. Capacity is adequate. Unlike the minifridge, it doesn't feel cramped at all, it's more like a downsized version of a regular fridge. You can store a big 2-liter bottle right at the door or a decent sized birthday cake along with a bunch of other stuff. Freezer works well and can accommodate 2 regular sized ice trays. The LED lamp is nice and bright. There is an egg tray included along with a small ice tray and a chilled tray. Door shelves and crisper drawer is plastic, the good kind and the racks are surprisingly enough, glass. I've had it for around 8 months now, it's very silent, cooling is effective but the defrosting is manual which seems fair at this price. Power consumption is also quite low. It comes with a 16A plug, I'm using a generic converter to plug it into a standard 6A socket, which technically isn't good but so far my house hasn't burned down. Overall I'm quite satisfied with this purchase and would happily recommend it.",
            "#Useful for single person. Silent operation.\n# Enough storage. Don't stock over weight in door storage.Icing problem in freezer tray because of outer climatic conditions. No defrost button.\n# Prolonged poweroff cause water drain inside fridge. No separate ready for water to drain.",
