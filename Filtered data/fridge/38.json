And yes, Sometimes the door of the fridge by mistake can be leaft open... It will give you reminder beep... Which will define you that you haven't closed the door..... Well, newly bought..... So can't say much... But under 3 days everything went very awesome.... \u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764...",
            "Bought this in big billion day sale. Silent operation and good quality plastic used. LG has adapted well to indian market consumers and the climate and they make good tailored products for indian markets.\n\nThe vegetable tray is a bit small and should have been big. Also there should be a bulb in the freezer compartment.\n\nOperation wise it is good and the door alarm is handy. Cooling is fine till now but actually will be tested during summers.",

            "I have been using this since last 2 days - overall pretty good performance so far !\n\nFlipcart delivery is awesome; delivery staffs are very decent and infact installation completed by the very next day of Delivery",
            "Decent design with plenty storage. But fridge door is making little sound while closing and it's too tight, top freezer door is smooth. Lg technician don't want to fix it rather in hurry to leave my place while installing. Other wise I could have given 5star.",
            "I loved this product\u2764\ud83d\udc9e\nThat's very spacious fridge... Like I have put on many things inside then also it looks empty... Cooling power is fabulous..... And yes, Sometimes the door of the fridge by mistake can be leaft open... It will give you reminder beep... Which will define you that you haven't closed the door..... Well, newly bought..... So can't say much... But under 3 days everything went very awesome.... \u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764...",
            "Bought this in big billion day sale. Silent operation and good quality plastic used. LG has adapted well to indian market consumers and the climate and they make good tailored products for indian markets.\n\nThe vegetable tray is a bit small and should have been big. Also there should be a bulb in the freezer compartment.\n\nOperation wise it is good and the door alarm is handy. Cooling is fine till now but actually will be tested during summers.",
            "Good refrigerator. Almost silent performance. Got a good deal during Big Billion Days sale event. However shelf placement needs to be checked. Can add up more space by ordering one additional shelf from service centre. Overall satisfactory purchase.",
            "A very well built and quality product from LG. Cooling is uniform and quick. The vegetable tray and extra fruit tray keeps fruits and vegetables dry and crispy without dew or becoming soggy. Lots of big and usable bottle trays. Back is concealed for a good finish. Since LG manufactures their own compressors, expect the compressor to last long. The design is distinctively LG with nothing borrowed or shared with brands. I assume the smart diagnostics mobile app facility works but did not try. Freezer is large and spacious and does not look too big compared to the fridge zone. Ice box has a large bin and two ice maker trays with twist knobs. Cons: The glass shelves seem fragile though. And the temperature settings could have been kept outside rather than deep inside and the buttons look unfortunately cheap. Summary: Overall an excellent product from LG and well worth the price.",
            "I have been using this machine for 1 month now.. dint like the look of the machine, dint like the aluminium tray like thing mounted on top of the machine, definitely not happy with the storage capacity, especially the veggies basket, which is too small... Samsung 345 L is huge and very spacious.. feeling like I made a mistake buying this model",
            "Very nice refrigerator. Compressor sound is negligible, but can be noticed in a kitchen without fan on. Vegetable tray is a little bit tricky to be removed from the fridge. Overall a nice product.",

            "Got Compressor issue in 8 months... Compressor is failed. No proper response from LG. All the food stored in refrigerator is wasted due to failure.",

            "looking average not bad..........",
            "Space in my previous refrigerator 300lt was higher than this 335lt. Design is good space should have been more atleast for vegetables box, cooling is perfect and installation required multiple calls. LG assigned it to incorrect area then they changed.",
            "Refrigerator is spacious, For build quality i will give 4 Stars. Plastic used have scope for improvement.. and runs very silently,\nDazzle Steel is non Shiny Grey Colour. Overall look is eye catchy ..Highly recommended.",
            "great fridge, technology, looks, cost everything is good",
            "Don't Buy it...This fridge has glass shelf which broke like sugar glass in 10 days. LG technician demanding money to replace the Glass without our fault. This toughen glass are like normal glass which broke in 10 days. LG has biggest flaw in this model they didn't tested the durability of there shelves and fooling the customers with low quality shelves. Kindly avoid buying such default product.. Totally an bad experience with LG. There Technician and customer care are highly unprofessional. LG lost all the trust..",
            "Not a good model, fridge capacity is misleading.",
            "Fantastic",
            "Good technology. Very good performance. Convertible is a big advantage if you do not have too many freezing items. Good for 4 person family. The price is too high. The exchange offer was bad and got 1540 out of 3080 agreed because some paint scratch was near the handle.",
            "The LG fridge is what its name is regarded for and is a must buy.\nThe fridge is true in its space wise, is cheap, no maintenance, look wise great and performance also.",
            "Nice product..",
            "Good product which consumes less electricity. It consumes only 160 Watts of power compared to other product. Always LG products are good. Special thanks to Flipkart for giving this product for almost half price during big billion days.",
            "Worst refrigerator, Cooling is to bad,",
            "Received the refrigerator (335 L) in 2 days. LG technician opened the box and installed the fridge, and also provided instructions on how to use. 335 L doesn't seem that big. Go for 360 L if your family has 4 or more members.\nThe fridge is somewhat energy efficient. Even with 3 stars for a 335 liter fridge, it consumes only 215 units per year. A 5 star 200 liter fridge would consume around 104 units per year. I chose this fridge cause of the inverter linear compressor and for the convertible mode.",
            "Felt very good product from LG. Value for money on the size and design. The only thing I felt is the glasses inside are somewhat delicate not capable of high use. Remaining all good....happy purchase",
