Once enquired about the issue of cooling, it was found that it was an common failure with this refrigerator regarding lower half cooling. Even though after so many complaints, if failure is repeating some how it is questionable to the brand or may be its their strategy for maintenance revenue. Overall, within 2 years with such performance, i will not suggest to go for this brand.\nThanks\n\nOverall 2*/5*",
