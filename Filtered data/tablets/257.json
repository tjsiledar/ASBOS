All iPads offer users a great multi-touch experience, but the iPad Pro's redesigned Retina display sets a whole new standard. This iPad's display is brighter and more responsive than ever. It is also less reflective than regular tablets. Everything feels smooth, fast, and immersive on the iPad Pro. The iPad's fingerprint-resistant oleophobic coating protects it from smudges.",
        "Endless Fun": "This iPad supports various software that make both work and play fun. Apps like Adobe Photoshop Lightroom lets you make professional-level adjustments to your photos on the go with a simple tap and swipe gesture. The iPad Pro also includes features like Great Big Story which lets you watch a curated playlist of the best videos from around the world, the Star Walk 2 which brings you lifelike images of stars, planets, and comets, and Houzz which lets you use the Apple Pencil to write and draw on high-resolution home renovation images.",
        "Incredible Refresh Rate": "The iPad Pro's Retina display supports a refresh rate of 120 Hz so the videos you watch on it look spectacular, while video games run smoothly without any distracting artifacts. The iPad Pro intuitively responds to commands regardless of whether you use the display with your finger or the Apple Pencil.",

Apple's custom-designed anti-reflective coating makes this iPad Pro's display clear and readable.",
        "Seamless Multitasking": "When updated with the iOS 11, the iPad Pro's all-new Dock makes it easy to open your favourite and recently used files and apps. Use the Slide Over or Split View apps if you want to stay active or work on two apps simultaneously.",
        "Powerful Performance": "Powered by the A10X Fusion chip which has a 64-bit architecture and six cores, the iPad Pro is packed with incredible power. You can edit 4K videos, or use uMake to create elaborate 3D drawings or models and export them as industry-style formats. The iPad Pro also has the AudioDesk Format which lets you capture building design concepts digitally, anywhere you are. The Bloomberg Professional app lets you view real-time data, charts, graphs, and more such documents when you multitask. Apple's ISP (Image Signal Processing) uses machine learning to breathe life into your photos and videos so they look lifelike.",

All this goodness is packed into a neat and compact device that is the iPad Pro. Its sleek and compact design means you can carry your iPad around with you and work on the go.",
        "Wireless Connectivity": "Stream videos or browse the Internet at your leisure, the iPad Pro's Wi-Fi connectivity offers you the world in your hands.",
        "Cameras": "The iPad Pro features the same cameras as the iPhone 7. The 12 MP rear and 7 MP front cameras in the Apple iPad Pro have an advanced optical image stabilization function and a ratio of f/1.8 which allow you to click picture-perfect photos and videos even in low-light conditions. The iPad's wide color capture feature helps you click the perfect Instagram-worthy selfies.",

            "First of All Thanks Flipkart for such a Wonderful price for a Beast Like This. This is my first Apple product. I must tell you the price I paid is complete justice. Every vertical has been completely justified by this. Speed, Display, Touch, Battery and specially sound is awesome. Viewing things on Laptop is always makes you feel good but on this it's awesome.\n\nOverall it's worth every penny I paid. It's on 2017 but still fails every model of 2018. Just Go For It !!",
            "I have used iPad before but this one is classy and crisp. Thank you Flipkart for the earlier than expected delivery. The iPad Pro 10.5 is now in a super new level and the Apple pencil experience was out of this world.",
            "product is Good but don't buy it if you really don't need it. after a week you really start realising that you don't need to but such a expensive tablet. any apple ipad costing around 25k can satisfy your tablet need..also windows users will never find its file saving method and opening method better than windows itself. Anyway Apple needs to simplify it's UI. they must take reference from windows for doing it like android. Apple pencil works fine on the pad.\nThanks.",
            "Wow.. colour display (P3) is amazing. 120 Hz refresh rate is just amazing. You can never notice any lagging in this device. With apple pencil it is a beast which can defeat most of the laptops! I have bought the 64 gb Version along with the Sandisk Wifi Stick of 64 gb and the apple pencil in the Bigbillion days. I got it in 40K and the Sandisk Stick is 2.5K . It is a reasonable price. Why should I buy the 256 GB version spending about 20K money more.. I should suggest every student to go for the 64 GB storage.",

As Powerful as it gets with the A10x fusion chip, 4gb ddr4 ram.\n\nThe best thing though, is the backing up of the hardware, through the software. IOS11 is a real big upgrade for the Ipad, and is a huge selling point from my point of view. It takes the Ipad way ahead of its competition with the split screen use, drag and drop feature, and much more.\n\nThe speakers will make you forget, all other audio devices, it's loud, clear, has a good bass. I would at least hear one song for the sake of listening to those speakers.\n\nThe cameras too. This ipad has got the iphone 7 camera, and I can't believe, apple gave those cameras on an Ipad. It's just awesome.\n\nGaming experience in this Ipad with the pro motion display, or the 120hz display, is just future stuff, at present. No other tablets are even nearby. Games look super smooth with yhe high frame rates, and you will never want to play games on other mobile devices.\n\nLastly, this Ipad has no competition, and is in the league of it's own. Kudos to apple \u270c\ufe0f\n\n\n\nLastly,",

            "the fact that we can't increase the memory or can't connect to PC or can't download and work with any 3rd party software restricts the device to do so many wonderful things , my only question is why the Apple is not working on it to be more productive and utilized....",
            "A very nice product.. Delivered in good condition, and i am loving it. The only thing is you cannot make calls from this Ipad even after inserting Sim. Since Sim is needed only to access internet. Overall IOS 11 is awesome.. Just go for it",
            "it is one of the best tablet I have ever seen. bro don't take any samsung tab because this is best. pros:1) pro motion display 2) best camera ever in any tablet. 3) it is powerful ipad with A10X fusion chip. 4) 8000 mah battery. cones:1) not earphone in box. 2) and not fast charger in box.",
            "Hmm It ws d first ipad in ma life , i ws waiting fo release of dis beauty fro 3-4 mnths actually i planned 9.7 before but after rumours started cmng on phonearena i thought waiting for 10.5 is must, soo finally apple released ipad pro , dat night i watched full apple keynote.

            "very good product.100% satisfied.\nAfter a rough and tough use of 3 years is very well working. Really like this product.",
            "Good display, great battery, fine performance, not that great camera but manageable.",
            "Its super smooth for multitask and excelent for gaming , ut can handle all the big games like pubg and all in 120 fps with incredible experience",
            "Device is a beast, perfect in every way.Got it at at a very attractive price. But the packaging by flipkart was not upto the mark, considering the product is delicate, packaging standards should be improved for the electronic devices.",
            "One of the best ipad i have ever purchased. The 10.5 size is the perfect fit for most of the purposes. This is quite an improvement from the previous generation ipad's. The bezels are pretty thin, the form factor is very slim, palm rejection works great.\nThe only thing which i feel missing is the face recognition. IOS 12 works great, but it would have been better with face recognition. Battery is little weaker,what i feel, but still not a deal breaker. I purchased this on flipkart offer 37.5k...\nREAD MORE",
            "This ipad pro is the best one by far up until now even after the newer iPad pro 2018 has been launched. This one has the A10X which is lightning fast. You can render huge 4k files and raw files on it on the go. The camera is the best in any tablet so far and yes that is including the iPad pro 2018 coz the latter doesn't have OIS. And since this is a tablet which makes it a media consumption device let's talk about the things that matter if you are a media junkie just like me. The battery life is just insane. iOS is so good that the standby battery drain overnight (around 8-10 hours) is just 1% for me. The speakers are the best on any tablet by far (the 2018 ipad pro I'm hoping will be a bit better although I don't know how Apple could improve upon the already kickass speakers). The speakers are so good that it is better than most laptops out there. Finally, the screen is just so mesmerizing. The day I got it and even now I find myself lost in that beautiful retina 120 Hz screen. The colors pop out and the iPad can get extremely bright. And now probably the best thing about it is that it will continue to have support for another 4 years thanks to Apple. Overall, it has been a great purchase and a wonderful experience.",
            "Its been around a month, using iPad 10.5 pro bought at 37.5k and working absolutely fantastic.\n\nPros\nPerformance is good as we expect from an apple product with better graphics and smooth touch\nCamera quality is also an average however better than any tablet/laptop you can compare with..\nAccessibility is not so difficult than I have been heard from roumers\nBest gadget for gaming perspective as no performance lag, no hanging problem and no screen sharpness\nIt is having good connectivity with other gadgets such as Bluetooth keyboard, mouse, headsets, speakers and mobile devices\n\nCons\nBattery backup is good however taking too much time to fully charge at once i.e. Overnight\nOriginal gadgets such as pencil n keypad is too costly n over priced still you can manage to get Bluetooth once which suits well\n\n\nOverall it is good n decent product which can handle your personal n professional work together. Best in range n blindly go for it if you are looking for tablet as durability, accessibility and better performance than any other gadget",
            "It's Apple !!! nothing more to say. Best in class, best in performance, best in style, best in everything and the most important thing is that you won't regret for making this choice. Those who are reading this, you are at the right place, just go ahead and get it. I got it at a very good deal for 35K during the Big Billion Day. Loved it \ud83e\udd29",
            "PRODUCTIVITY ON THE GO\n.. A very powerful device. very snappy experience ..\nThe 120 Hz pro motion display is something to be appreciated live.. colours are vibrant. thanks to wide P3 colour gamut .\n\nAugmented reality works flawless and is an amazing experience and Apps like jigspace is the coolest way to learn how stuffs work.\nIOS 12 brings the best out of this device ,multitasking using split window ,slide over and moreover picture in picture video playback makes the device a productive beast. one can use maximum of 4 apps at once , all enabled : 2 on split screen 1 on slide over and 1 on pip video playback.\n\nBattery usage:\non light usage 11-12 hrs\non moderate usage 10 hrs\non heavy usage like gaming around 4-6 hrs depending on the game.\n\nReading books on a bigger 10.5 inch display is somewhat better experience than reading on smartphones moreover u can underline , highlight text and draw on the PDF using pre-installed NOTES app.\n\nLots of things can be done with this iPad pro, pro means productivity on the go..\nbest for professionals..\n\nGot it for 35,100 only on big billion day using HDFC card",
            "Working like charm. iOS 11.3 one of the best. Everything is fine. I got it 39990 Rs from flipkart. Thank you flipkart on timely delivery. Must buy!!!",

            "This iPad has been my first apple product. While I was certain that I needed an iPad for my browsing requirements at home and also whilst at travel, I was not sure which model to go for. After a lot of research, I zeroed in on 10.5 iPad Pro. My reasons for selecting this model are as follows:\n\n> better display than the 9 inch version\n> smooth operation and really fast\n> the specs are latest so will not get slow with iterations in iOS\n> Ideal size for a non professional use compared to a 12 inch model\n\nI have been using the tablet for about a month and the only minus that I notice is that it is a very good fingerprint magnet. Excellent device to browse, read and play games. Feels premium. iOS 11 update has bumped up the experience significantly. The best tablet around if you are interested in one.\n\nFinally, kudos to Flipkart for the excellent delivery. The entire purchasing experience was quick and extremely satisfying.\n\nThank you.\n\n\nPS: A note from my eight year old son.........It has a very large screen and that is the best quality in an iPad.",

            "overall good but so good as people talking about it. after using this product what I found:\n- Display is good for reading and browsing but sharpness is really bad. even in normal mobile you will find better sharpness and colour balance. it is really disappointing. Don't know why people talking about its display quality that it has best in class. aspect ratio of display is also very bad. 4:3 ratio is very old fashion. if you watch even YouTube you will find small part of screen playing video....\nREAD MORE",
            "you can actually go paperless, excellent refresh rate so apple pencil works superb, key board is really helpful. apple gives nothing free so need to pay for all accessories. MS office is not free you need to subscribe for rs.360/- per month to make use of iPad fully or to go paperless.",
            "Very good and genuine seller. Received my Ipad in a good condition and 2 days before delivery date. Hats off",
            "It\u2019s an amazing product .... very useful ... easy to carry when you go out... and I strongly recommend people to buy the product coz it\u2019s very useful...",

            "Thanks for the offer and good delivery.\nEverything was fine except for the main box inside the package looks little old with dirtmarka and scratches, and i dont know how the scratches come on the ipad box if it was sealed from outside by the company itself\ud83d\ude07\ud83d\ude2c..\nHowever the ipad was perfect .. checked everything, it was the genuine one.",
            "A great product to boost your productivity, I am writing this review after 1 Month. Pros : Clear display, Good Quality Sound, Highly productive for work with apple pencil, Performance is quite excellent, and look wise its amazing. Cons : Camera is good but it could have been better, A slightly small screen space because of touch id. Suggestion: if you really want to make is worth of money don't forget to buy apple pencil.",
            "I bought this with a Pencil. Amazing screen, both Cameras, refresh rate is 120 Hz which you cannot identify normally but watching videos and movies is a treat. Writing with Pencil is buttery smooth like on paper. You can go for it if budget is allowing as it will serve you for min 3 to 4 years as my previous ipad Air 2 did good job for almost 4 years. if someone is tight on budget, iPad 6th Generation is also a terrific. For sure there is no competition of iPad in Tablets atleast.",
            "Worth buying .. got it for 44900 on june 2018. Loved using it.. flawless page transition while using 5000pgs pdf and apple pencil works very well. Recommended for those hu love gaming (PUBG) ,photoshop works etc",

I already own a iPhone 8 and now this iPad. I'm using iPhone since 2 years now, but till now I have never noticed any lagging what so ever. Same applies for this Ipad and the build quality is again top notch as expected.",

Got it in an offer 36117 thankyou Flipkart... even though the delivery was on time as they mentioned but taking a week is little frustrating as you deliver the 160 rupees book that too from a remote seller in a very next day... packing was worst as I opened and found the box was not pasted or glued properly and my ipad box was dancing inside the bag due to the free space they left... Anyway I got the right product in a right way.. thankyou Flipkart for the heart whelming offers..",
