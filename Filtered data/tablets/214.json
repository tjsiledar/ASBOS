S pen, which works pretty well with variety of functions.\n3. Premium look of the tab, Sleek design, matte colour body, and two powerful clear sound speakers on both sides of the tablet which give you premium sound experience.\n\nCons:-\n1. Although the tab supports fast charging, they give you an ordinary charger. No turbo charger added in the pack, so you will have to buy one or it will charge slower.\n2. No extra S pen nib in the pack, so if the nib of pen gets distorted, you will need to buy it from open market.\n3. Display is not led (but still gives premium experience if you are not addicted to led) and there is no gorilla glass covering so you have to buy temper glass for screen guarding.",

            "This is over all good but price is higher you may compare to apple and choose this over for s pen ..i did that too .. battery capacity was good 7040mah but it takes time like 3.30mins for full charge 1hr 30mins for 30% charge . S pens lag sometime . If you're just looking for a good storage and zoom meeting and s pen then go for this otherwise go for something else . Im using this for 3 days its good thou but price is higher",

I have gone to this tablet because my budget was just 30K and I was getting I pad 8 32 Gb for this and for me brand is never a constraint. Display is good. Touch sensitivity is also good. S pen works brilliantly. This gives call feature too which apple ipad does not give. I have just one con till now: The charging time is very high. If samsung would have provided fast charging facility with this, then it would be a beast in this range. It takes 3.5 hours to charge it too 100%.",
            "Nice tablet , i m perfectly happy, need little improvement, lil slow and hangs sometimes,\n\nWriting experience is good on Samsung's notes app and also one one note by microsoft ,its not that lagy, writing experience is on par with i pad 7th gen, but as usual their is always a glass like feel.\nAs a tablet its a good value for money ,\n\nKaash Processor achha hota\nSo it would be like sone me suhaga ,\n\nWant samsung to give \"paperlike\"screen protector so as to boost the writing experience on the tab ,\n\nAlso worried about the delecasy of s pen , which is light to hold but nib is like a cute baby very delicate.\n\nI m okay with the tab , seems like i made a good choice.",
            "Best for the price you can get and the delivery is fast and s pen is not sharp as other Samsung devices",
            "Awesome fast delivery of Flipkart. I got this product just after the day i ordered. Good tablet for students, specially for online classes. Picture quality awesome. \u2764\ufe0f",
            "This tab is a great option if you are looking for a tab that suffices your online classes and study.\nYou can do almost all the essential things that is needed for smart studies nowadays.\nPros\n1. Spen is a great option that will ease your writing experience especially for annotation and marking while reading epaper and book.\n2. Samsung notes helps us to write, save, edit and delete your handwritten notes in a convenient way. (it's similar to writing on paper with pen).\nNot only this, you can re organise the stuffs as per your requirement.\n3. Write on pdf is a great feature to write, annotate or mark your ebook while reading. I use to write important notes and highlight fact during reading epaper.\n4. Sketching and creativity is one of the best features for innovative children.\n5. With latest android version 11,you can download almost all essential apps with 64 GB ROM and 4GB RAM.\n6. The camera is okay for attending lecture and online classes.\n7. Battery is also enough for a full day normal usage.\n8. Dolby atoms is really effective while listening to music with wired /wireless headphones.\nCons\n1. You will face a little bit glitch when overloaded with dozen of apps. So it's better to remove or uninstall unnecessary apps.\n2. The tab has hanging problem even when most of the apps are not running in the background. But it automatically turn on after that.\n3. You can't play games as it has heating issue with heavy work load.\n4. Charging time is slow.( 3-4 hours full charge)\n5. Charger isn't fast charger.\nThanks.\nI'll write more after using more.",
            "Camera quality is good but i am giving 4 stars because its just of 5mp and rear is of 8mp thats good but not enough good to take sceneries but for video conferencing its very good and there were some issues with touch but they got resolved and the battery life is of 7040 mah but i had to use zoom app for my online classes and it consumes a lot of battery over all the performance is good",
            "Amazing product\nWas thinking of buying something else as this tab is almost a year old, but couldn't find anything better than this . To my surprise it works like butter and with the s pen working on it becomes a lot easier, even note taking on the tab is smooth",
            "I'm using this tab for last 8 months and I'm very satisfied with it, battery works very well although charging is slow, pencil tip is working properly with no problem till now, camera quality is not very good, I purchased it in diwali sale so got it with good deal after using credit card, storage is also adequate so if you want to purchase a tab for studies or anything than go for it.",
            "I brought it about a 2-3 weeks ago, so I'm writing this review according to this usage. For this price range with a Spen is an absolutely amazing purchase option as student. I write all my notes in this tab, there is no lag, good display, lot options available. Only one thing i will want to point out is the battery charging time, it takes up a long time to get 100% charged.\nSo if you are a student like me, i would say go for it\ud83d\udc4d",
            "Excellent product. Display colors are very good. The battery on moderate use goes full day comfortably. The S pen is great and latency is very minimal. The sound is excellent with stereo speakers. The camera is average both front and back, needs improvement. Best for entertainment like movie music. Games like Asphalt, SBK16, Fifa, etc runs smoothly. Calling is fine but only on speakers and headsets. No earpiece. Overall excellent.",
            "You should give an powerful processar and excellent front camera because now a days many people make educational video , teach online and online meetings. You should make online available a good web camera sported android samsung tablet and smartphone a separate stylus if we lost the one, and best quality mic or wireless mic and should give screen recorder with face camera . You know only to take money and don't know to give facility . Improve your self otherwise there are many competitor like mi , realme, oppo are coming they will destroy you samsung . Mi pad 5 is far better than you realme pad is best but it doesn't have the stylus pen but mi pad 5 is not available in india so I had to purchase samsung tablet",

She loved it.\nBattery life is good, note-taking, taking classes, teaching is good as well.\n\nDex mode is good but don't expect it to be a computer. Apps (including google chrome) work in mobile mode only. Some apps provide support for desktop mode but that's really a hassle.\nyou cannot connect additional screens via HDMI or type c due to lack of hardware support, you can cast your screen though.\n\nso in short it is a Samsung mobile with big touchscreen and spen",

            "I researched a lot before I bought my first tab. I already have a powerful laptop, but I wanted something very handy with a bigger screen than a mobile's.\nThe Tab S6 lite ticks all the right boxes.\n\nCamera is irrelevant in a tab.

Now they rejected the replacement as it's been 4 or 5 days after delivery and they claim that it would be customer induced damage.

Does not get hot- which I think is sound. Screen is nice.\nOne thing that I like the most is its samsung note which helps one to takes notes while screen recording or online classes smoothly.
