Hybrid sim slot\n5.(a) awesome sound ,u can customize the sound as desire.,there is a separate app for sound.\nOverall deserves 4.5 star\nU can't find the better product in this range in comparison to tablet\n6.It's a long time when great android tablet comes since 2015\n7.Interesting ,no indian review found of the product on YouTube neither by geekyranjit or technical sharma\n8.scrolling(up to down ,down to up ,it's like circle button of mouse)problem solved:::under developer option ,search for drawing option then turn off window, animation,transition scales , scrolling will work smooth as butter or either you just root your device and change the value on build .prop (scrolling section) ,just reboot and see the magic",
            "First impression of lenovo tab 4 8 plus. I was little bit of disappointed after seeing the specification where it is written no voice call and only 16 gb ROM. As I was waiting for this tab since the announcement made in feb'17. During BBD all another version launched but this one is not. Now my wait is over and I received the tab within 2 days of order.\n\nDesign- Galssy and classy just similar to Sony Xperia z5.

            "Looks beautiful! Sound is beautiful, with the Dolby Atmos.. Feels a li'l slipperry due to the glass back(and no cases available yet!!). Performance is neat i thought. Fast. 3gb seems to be enough although I've not tried playing games.. But there's barely any Memory left for our use as about 7gb is used up in the OS.. The reason i waited and bought this one was the display - 283ppi. Especially since I'm planning to use it as a reading tool as well. Overall happy after 2 days of use!",
            "a good tab right now in the market ... in this price. range\nbut there is one major issue is internal storage the storage is just 16 gb its very low for gamers like me . and battery is not so good ...\notherwise its great choice \ud83d\udc4c",

Here is my experience after using it for 2 days\n\nPros:\n\nGood Built Quality and looks good, glass back, pretty light weight\n\nAmazing speakers, dual front firing with Dolby Atmos, excellent via headphone jack as well.\n\nGood battery life and performance, Snapdragon 625 never disappoints.

I would say it is nit picking and will not bother you as battery last long\n\nBiggest con is 16gb Inbuilt spave out of which 7.5 or 8 gb is used by system. However you can add a micro sd card.\n\nScrolling issue, I am not sure if this is a bug or something to go with integration of Apps, scrolling is not that smooth inside some apps, don't get me wrong here, there is no lag but the scrolling needs to be pushed a little which is not that fluid, I am sure it can be fixed via a update. However you will not notice any lag in the laucher or while opening apps. It is just some apps.\n\nTo end the review here, If you have budget of 15k plus go for this tab it will not dissapoint you.

            "Got it with 10% cashback with Axis bank card and also rs. 200 instant cashback.\nWriting this review after almost 20 days of usage:\nAt the price of 16K its a really good tablet. I wanted a tab with qualcomm snapdragon processor and with more than 2gig RAM. Found this tab to fulfil my required specs. This is a 3GB RAM + 16GB internal memory version comes with Android 7.1.1 out of the box plus few updated that were downloaded later. Works very smooth. One feature i like most is for few apps you can share screen and run two simultaneously. Even in that mode no lag is observed.\nMain purpose of my usage goes into lot of browsing along with whatsapp and youtube plus online video lecture streaming. I observed that it streams HD 1080 videos without any lags and no hangs or lags eveb after app streaming videos is closed. I have used Samsung Tab2 GT P3100 for around 4 and half years and brought this tab when my previous tab entered the restart loop with no effect of factory reset also.\nI can say its a definitely go for tab for this budget. Sound is good and sufficient. Display is superb. Volume and power button appears to be sturdy when pressed. Power button has a fingerprint sensor and it works great and fast. Weight is less, slim design and feel is premium although the glass back and screen surface attract fingerprint a lot. But design is simple and superb. Notification light is helpful. I found screen brightness to be sufficient and i can say its more tgan sufficient. Display clarity and color is great. Both camera are good and suffice the purpose. I havent tried low light photography yet and not used the flash too. Camera software does not have much settings available.\nOf 16GB internal memory more than half is resreved by system which is quite high. But expandable memory via microSD card is present so no issue.\nOne thing i felt is that it slips off easily if kept on uneven surface.so you need to be carefull if it is kept on lap while sitting or so. Also no cover is available. But thats not an issue for me.\nEvery time i use it i found it value for money and feel to have made correct decision in selecting this tab.\nI definitely recommend this tab for budget of 16k.\nAnd as always flipkart service was up to mark with timely delivery and great price.",
            "Good tab for price . Not a big fan of camera on tabs and mobile's . Can take decent photo . Space is an issue as it gets clogged fast in spite of putting extra SD card which the tab takes up and cannot be used elsewhere . Performance issues not much as I am only a light user of it . Me and kids using it with seperate user interface which is very nice . Inspite of multiple users it responds well . The finger sensor on the main On Off button is also cool as it changes the user also automatically .",

Hybrid sim slot\n5.(a) awesome sound ,u can customize the sound as desire.,there is a separate app for sound.\nOverall deserves 4.5 star\nU can't find the better product in this range in comparison to tablet\n6.It's a long time when great android tablet comes since 2015\n7.Interesting ,no indian review found of the product on YouTube neither by geekyranjit or technical sharma\n8.scrolling(up to down ,down to up ,it's like circle button of mouse)problem solved:::under developer option ,search for drawing option then turn off window, animation,transition scales , scrolling will work smooth as butter or either you just root your device and change the value on build .prop (scrolling section) ,just reboot and see the magic",

            "Voice call :\nYes, provided as an default calling app for other sim.\nHowever, tab is 4G LTE; no Volte, so if you want to use Jio sim you can use Jio voice call app and make calls very easily. I am using it.\nBattery:\nQuite good charging time is ok and long lasting.\nUSB :\nUSB C type is provided which is not common with other android mobiles so you will face the problem in connecting it with other chargers.\nThe touch is good enough.\nA 8\" classy rich look tab stand on edge through its competitor.\nBoth the Cameras are very good..\nVery fast in processing as installing and uninstalling an app will hardly a matter of eye blink.\nNo heating problem as far I have used.\nFor readers:\nColour inversion is provided. However I am using blue light filter app which will make your screen warm in colour (f.lux for desktop).\nFinger sensor detects quite well.\nSpeakers are more than awesome.\nFor earphone user, an earphone w/o mic works also quite well even when puttting your tab at a distance.\n\nEarphone jack faces some problem while detecting the earphone.\n\nStorage is good for apps only and general reding stuff along with photos and songs storage is not a matter of concern.\nBoth sims are of nano type,\n\nThough slippery little bit, but not a fingerprint magnet.\nI have purchased a fast way book cover black in colur, it gives this tab a note diary look and preserves its rich appearance with safety.",

            "nice tablet from lenovo.\ncompared with lenovo yoga, this looks more like a phone because, the length is more and width is small which is not the case of lenovo yoga 8 inch tablet.\n\nPros:\n1. good battery backup. with minimum usage, 100% lasts upto three complete days with network on and data, gps on. with moderate usage, it lasts for upto 1.5 to 2 complete days. for heavy usage, it can hardly last upto or less than a day. everything depends on the amount of usage.\n2. charges quickly within three hours or so.\n3. very nice design build quality.\n4. this doesn't require jio4g voice app to be installed. it has 4g volte capability. make sure to distinguish the usage of jio4g voice app. this is installed in those phone which doesn't have volte support\n5. sound quality is good enough\n6. fingerprint sensor works fine.\n\nCons:\n1. lesser internal memory. you will have only around 10 to 11gb internal memory available.\n2. camera not that good. of course we cannot demand a high quality camera from an 8inch tablet that too in this price range.\n3. some times faced problem with headset as it doesn't get recognized. not a serious problem, though.\n4. hybrid sim slot which restricts you in expanding the memory or adding a sim.\n\noverall, a nice product from lenovo.",

            "Honest Review After Using The Tablet for 2 months.\nThe look is premium. The tab is solid enough. you can play pubg without any lag. 3gb of ram is gud. Major prblm is STORAGE.. it's only 16 gb(out of which 7 gb is used by os).\nBut we have an option to merge external storage with internal. so the prblm is solved. I got 3 updates within 2 months and also an upgrade to Android pie 9.0. Also, i got update to volte feature. The tab handles the load well. Adapter provided for charging heats a lot while charging the device even in AC room. so i have to remove it for some time and charge again.\noverall a gud buy.",
            "First of all I would like to thank Flipkart for its speedy delivery in just 24 hours. Now about the Tab: its just awesome\ud83d\udc4d, great tab to have. After a lot research i opted to buy this tab, which is just fabulous. Not too high end nor too low, i think its perfect for medium user like me, with great battery backup, and also with a finger print scanner. Display is great too. With not too bad camera.",
            "This product is awesome product developed by lenovo.\nI am getting this product on time.\nI am fully satisfied by this product.\nIt has a fingerprint sensor at the right side and work as very fast.",
            "Cons : 1. Very slippery due to the glass back.2. Fingerprint magnet. 3. The UI has utilized 8gb already so only 7-8 gb for internal memory.\nPro: 1. Good sound quality due to dual speaker with Dolby Atmos 2. Very crisp and clear screen 3. Good battery backup.",
            "Tab is good but need to improve storage,price is so high if it is 32 GB price is worthy otherwise not worthy in case of price range",
            "Delivered on time. But regret to say that no proper packaging by supplier, so chances of damages.\nProduct is very good 1) very loud n clear sound 2) perfect HD display 3) size 8inch is good for all usage.\nCould reduce the price with non-calling options & may remove finger print sensor as well.",
            "Please note, there are two different models of Lenovo Tab 4 8 plus. This model has 3GB RAM and 16GB Internal storage. There is another model with 4GB RAM and 64GB internal storage which is Rs.21,999.00. That model is not available in flipkart and it is available in Amazon.\nPros:\n1) Very good display\n2) Superb Audion Experience especially in Landscape mode while watching full screen videos.\n3) Extremely good build quality. Feels premium\n4) Running Android 7.1.1 and received multiple updates in last few weeks.\n5) Very good gaming performance. Very responsive.\n6) USB Type C and Finger print sensor at this price range is awesome.\n7) Support for 2 SIMs or SIM+SD Card.\n\nCons:\n1) No accessories available from Lenovo in India (Folio case, Bumper Case, Pen etc)\n2) 4GB model is the best option but priced much higher compared to the 3GB model ( Costs a lot more just for the additional RAM and Storage, No other changes compared to the 3GB model)\n\nI'm using it for the last few weeks and happy about its performance. I strongly recommend it. (If your budget allows, buy the 4GB model)",
            "Beautiful product, stunning display. Adequate performance and light. Fits well into the palm of ones hand . Haven't tried using it for the heavier gaming apps but it's a neat buy if you are looking for a tab that's less than 10 inches .",
            "Product is good\ncons:\nram 1.5 used with no apps running\ninternal nearly 8gb available of 16gb\npros:\neven though , good speed for normal use,\naudio dolby atmos loved it\nscreen resolution,video clarity good.\n\ncamera- you can't ask for clarity of a phone camera on a tablet-average quality good for video calling\nNo tests on gaming\n\n\n\nIs it worth for 17k moneys? no\nsoftware sucks..getting stuck using factory installed apps",
            "Fast and responsive tab. Perfect for watching movies & YouTube, and for reading books.\n\nI'm loving PDF reading on this tab. Screen quality is nice. High resolution screen is vibrant looking.\n\nListening to music is a joy, both with headphones and without - the speakers are front firing, reasonably loud and accurate sounding.\n\nI don't play games so can't comment on that part. But for my use, snapdragon 625 with 3GB is snappy enough.\n\nI'll highly recommend it.",
            "Using this tab from 2 months, awesome experience. Display is very good, light weight. Dolby Atmos sound is great and it makes watching videos an amazing experience. Just go for it blindly. Fingerprint sensor is not so fast, rest everything is good.",
            "one issue with earphone pluging.\nWhen i plug earphone for the first time it works well and notify earphone plugged in,and then when i remove and pluged in again, then it does not work well..\nWe here sounds from tab as well as in headphone..and there is no notification about earphone pluged in. :(\nTab is updated to latest version\n\nPls help",
            "This is the best tablet in this price range.\nDisplay is gr8, colours are good and it is extremely sharp with adequate brightness.\nPerformance is fantastic thanks to SD625 and 3GB RAM is also sufficient.\nSpeakers are fantastic!! They are dual front firing speakers with gr8 sound quality and loudness.\nThe build quality is gr8. The glass back feels gr8 and its not very much of a fingerprint magnet, it does a good job of preventing fingerprints.\nThe cameras are average, as expected from any tablet. The fingerprint sensor works well. The multi user functionality is quick and gets the job done.\nBattery life is also good enough. Not as good as the iPads but still better than most of the tablets in this price bracket thanks to the SD625.\nAlready received 3 updates within a couple of days. Maybe Lenovo can keep it up.\nThere is no voice calling but u can make calls through the jio app. There is a hybrid Sim slot.\nCons-\nBattery backup could have been better.\nThe storage provided is very low and u have to use an sdcard with it as only about 9GB storage is free.\nNot sure if Lenovo will provide any further updates.\nOverall a real bank for the buck. If you have a budget of below 20k then this one is a no brainier. Go for it!!",
            "After using 15 days i cud say this product is worth of every penny....when I was purchasing that product I hv som doubt in ma mind like does it support otg ,abt voice call n 4 g status so yes it works well on 4 g,supports pandrive through otg, average battery backup,loud sound.so overall it's worth to purchase.",
            "Just awesome. Excellent performance. Very fast microprocessor. Internet at lightning speed. Cameras are not excellent but pretty good. Dolby sound is better than expectations.\nI waited for three months in expectations of release of this tab and now I think my long waiting did not go in vain. Just go for it.",
            "When I ordered it, i bought in 18 hours\nVery fast delivery\nAnd tab also very good for this price range ( better than samsung tab A 2017 model )\nEvery thinking was perfect special display quality, no hanging and heating problem",
            "Very good product given the price involved. Speed is good, screen response is best in class. Battery and display is also good. I would recommend this as near as Ipad mini.",
            "the purpose of tablet is served, a good study companion and entertainer. special mention about the immersive Dolby Atmos stereo speakers, which completely rule out the necessity of headphones. A very satisfying product overall. Of you are looking for a camera of quality detail and dynamic range,oops! it is not for you",
            "3days of use, bought for my kid, first impression, it's looks very premium and executive TAB, observed for all school work it's very useful and for official work also. I liked it very much",
            "For limited usage the Tab is working fine (only for academic purpose). Though not as snappy as smartphones but large screen is handy to watch prime videos and read books. Camera is not used at all. Overall happy with Tab",
            "flipkart didnt mentuon true detail about voice call which is available in both sim as well as call disabling option is available in phone with working internet service.\nbattery backup about to 7 hrs in continuous browsing.\nabout 10 hrs in standby sim network mode.",
            "it's come with 3 GB ram. & fingerprint sensor.. which is the best. full HD screen is good brightness. SD 625 is one of the best professor for tablets with Adriano GPU... over all the best buy. but in India missing 4 GB ram version.\nalso it's cost bit more we are paying..\nmissing is it's official cover which should provide by Lenovo...",
            "on time delivery by Flipkart , excellent product loved it the moment I opened it.. It's working fine just updated the security and apps. Camera is ok no good not bad.. have kept for first full charging while writing this review. will update more after using it",
            "Lenovo tab4 8 plus very nice tab this price value for money display quality very powerfully all is good i like it",
            "Pros - Awesome display, great sound, light weight. Clean user interface, stock android experience. Really good for videos and reading.\n\nCons - Less internal storage (64GB Card added, problem solved), tablet is slippery (good case solves that problem)\n\nOverall great buy. Im loving it.",
            "Really appreciate the service of Flipkart, delivered my order within 2 Days.\nCash on delivery was swift as I contacted the delivery person in advance.\nI am satisfied with the service and look forward to deal again.",
            "The Tablet looks very premium due to the glass back. Screen looks amazing and it is adequately bright. It's also smooth thanks to the SD 625. I would like to mention that Flipkart says Android 7.0 in the specs but the tab ships in with Android 7.1.1 out of the box. Also there is no headphone issue whatsoever that some people have written about.\n\nPros:\n+Large display\n+Thin and light\n+Smooth and fast\n+No bloatware( I found all the preinstalled apps useful)\n+ Good looking interface and notification panel.\n+ Fingerprint security\n\nCons:\n-Accidental touches on the fingerprint sensor is quite frequent due to its positioning. (Power button is fingerprint sensor)\n-Although tab has Dolby Atmos dual speakers I did not find the sound noteworthy. It is just okaykish.\n-Battery life could be better but this is understandable because they made the tablet very thin and light.\n-No fast charge support, also the charger that comes in the box is kind of cheap.\n-This particular model has only 16 gigs of internal storage. Much of it is already consumed by the system.\n\n\n\nThe above mentioned shortcomings do not really bother me much. This is a great tablet that provides a wonderful android experience. Recommended.",
            "Lenovo Tab 4 8 Plus --\nPros : prime series tab with good sound amalgamated with Dolby quality ( equilizers with app). USB- C type connectors --> 10 to 90% charging takes ~ 2 hrs. Picture quality is crystal with FHD display. It houses multi user accounts , each with separate fingerprint smart unlocking. Independent account with separate app lists & preferences. Camera is decent, good enough for VC. Hybrid slots for SIMs ( 2 nano) or mSD card. Dial band WiFi.\n\nCons : Doesnt support 4G LTE voice calling ( for Jio use 4GVC app). Youtube doesnt go to full screen on landscape mode, needs manual touch for full screen. Backside of the tab is also glass, so needs special care with tab cover. FM works only with headset cable & in nnon airplane mode.\n\nOverall : Extremely smooth UI with Android 7.1. No clutter apps. Screenshot button is a good aaddition. Battery too runs for good amount of ttime. Light weight & responsive tab for personal & family use. !!",
            "Product is very good nice design. Great hardware Snapdragon 625.tablet is very fast and smooth. First time I have ordered the tablet , headphone jack of tablet is not working. I got replacement second time the wifi is always restart.thats why I am giving one star. B\u00e8tter to buy ipad.",
            "I am using this tab from last from 4-5 month performance wise it's working good.\nLight weight easy to handle, compact & also handy.\nBattery aslo performing well.\nBut I am facing one issue with whenever I try to open Excel sheet it's automatically restart the program, it's took 2-3 time to open & use the Excel sheet other than all are good I am happy & recommend to go for it",
            "Good battery life, Decent performance, Bright and colorful display, Great value.",
            "You cannot get a better tab than this.... It handles anything very easily...... No lag.....\nWay better than Samsung's tab A.... !! Happy with the delivery....!!",
            "No need of calling facility its just a price extension! Tab is good but the glass back panel is really a bad option, since there is not a single accessory available by lenovo in the market or at flipkart. No back cover, cases or gaurd etc. Battery takes a decade to get fully charged but the backup is good if you use it offline. Internal storage is 16gb that's seriously an issue. If lenovo had launched wifi only version of the tab with a low price like 11k .. it wud be better. Accessories are really required .",
            "First of all I'll confess i switched to android tablet from my previous ipad mini. This is the best tablet, an all rounder.. with respect to battery life its awesome, power effecient 2GHz SOC, crystal clear Full hd display with protective glasses both on front and back, gives an extremely premium look to tab. Its thin design makes u feel happy and comfortable whenever you hold the tab in your hand. Finger print sensor on side makes u feel protected. With an option to use 4g sim n expandable storage it will gain priority over ipad. Camera is good, not bad as they would say. Its for the people who are looking for premium tab in midrange budget, who loves to watch movies n bit of gaming.. Its best for reading too.. if u are planning to buy any tab within 20k. This should be your first choice.",
            "A great product for anyone looking for a tablet under 20 k solid features great processor with ample 3gb ram, a decent primary camera with flash secondary camera is just okay but does the job not your selfie camera though, beautiful full Hd display and great features like dolby sound out put front firing speakers, fingerprint sensor and option for expandable memory with an option for using sim. calls can be placed through jio app.A better alternative to Ipad 2017 in my opinion.",
            "Excellent tablet with great look and fast processor. Everything is perfect in it.",
            "Better that what we were expecting. Though pricebaba has rated display downwards, display is good enough. Overall a nice product. There's pre-installed blot-ware that occupies almost whole internal memory. You will have to have memory card. There's no separate port for memory card. Either of the sim-card port is to be used as a memory card slot. So it is either network or sim-card sort of funny situation.",
            "Surprised by the good build and finish. Remarkably light and comfortable to handle. Best display I have seen in an android tablet; visually seems no worse than my retina iPad Mini at about one third price. All systems smooth. Speaker sound good. Headphone sound superb with hi quality in ear phones and using Dolby Atmos / Equaliser Apps. Super job Lenovo.",
            "I am using it for the past 2 month and everything is fine except the battery life and the fingerprint reader. The fingerprint reader allows even the unsaved prints to open it, that is with the 5th attempt of any finger it allows the device to open. Battery drains little fast. If you are a heavy Internet or a media user don't go for it. This tab does the premium look, good audio output better screen result and not the battery. Lot of software bloats.",
            "Excellent product. Found it even more beautiful and solid in real life. Delivery was swift, earlier than expected. Thank you.",
            "Awesome Display.. Excellent Speed.. Superb look.. If it's 4gb ram with 64gb internal memory it'll be a best tab..",
            "Used this device for almost 2 weeks now and must say it is an awesome device to have.\nPerformance is awesome and has a very elegant hd display.\nOnly Con I could find out is otg support as the charging cable is of different type thus u can't plugin otg pendrives.",
            "A very good product from LENOVO. I had been searching for a fast and good tablet for past 3-4 months and finally settled for Lenovo tab 4 8\" plus....am soooooo happy.",
            "Using it from last one week. Till now didn't found any issue with product.\nSome drawbacks observed and can be improved by lenovo\n1.No headset with box you have to purchase separately.\n2.Out of 16gb 7 gb is occupied by Android system. usable space is 8gb only .\n3.It has hybrid sim slot (flipkart kindly mention this in specifications) ,You can use dual sim or one + memory card.\n4.Camera is not up-to mark photo quality is OK,camera button on screen not properly placed. Difficult to click photos.(do not expect good camera from tablets)\n\nGood things about tablet is\nLightweight\nFigure print security. Works very well without problem\nFine Sound quality.\nBattery back up.\nOver all nice product .It serves my purpose so I am happy with it.",

The experience of reading n watching movie is oustanding with this display.\n\nWith Dolby Atmos the sound is more louder n sharp and you will feel the 360 \u00b0 sound around you.\n\nThe next best thing about the tablet is it's light weight.it just weighs only 300gms. You literally feel like you are just holding a phone.\n\nWith 3gb ram n SD 625 processor with 2GZ speed you can download n run almost all imp apps n games and the phone will be working quite faster.\n\nDecent primary camera but the secondary camera looks promising.\n\nIt comes with latest android version 7(Nougat)\n\nThe user interface is fast n I didn't experience any lag between moving pages. It has a finger print sensor to unlock the screen.\n\nThe only problem is 16 gb storage. The system set up consumes 7gb n you ll be left with 9gb storage only but that can be rectified by inserting SD card. It is expandable up to 128gb\n\nOverall The best android tablet right now in the market at this price.

This happened me before with Xiaomi phones rocking Made In India tag.\nIn such cases, when i called customer care, they simply tell you that It's an electronic item and it's made in bulk so sometimes the defect (human error) is bound to happen ! ????\nMake in India doesn't oblige companies to JUST provide jobs(and not to train their employees) and make substandard products without adequate quality check. not cool !",

It has finger print sensor in power button and that makes it easier to use.\nIt can also take Sdcard.\n\nCons:\n========\nThe display is too boring and dull. It is dull and muted compared to even old Nexus 7 2013 edition with same resolution screen and same price point. They have used lower grade LCD panels to save money.\n\nOther problem is the weak processor. Cortex A53 is too weak to handle anything demanding. These are used in better processor as low power CPU cores to conserve energy. Here they just bumped up the GHz to make up for it, but sadly it doesn't work. The execution unit is too weak to handle workload as they are more of low power optimised core by design.\n\nSame goes for the GPU, it's too weak to handle Games at full HD.",

I went after 8 days but still the issue was not fixed technician told me he hasn't received all the necessary parts...During all this I called lenovo service more than 15 times & personally visited service center 2 times but nothing happened,even after 1 month my tab was not repaired..then finally after waiting for 35 days problem was fixed.
