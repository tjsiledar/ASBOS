            "In a nutshell its a great Phablet which has value for money. Go for it.\n\nWhat is Good:\n\na. Good Finish\nb. Decent screen resolution\nc. 1GB RAM\nd. Quad core process or with GPU built in ( Tested with couple of games and performance is pretty good)\ne. GPS is pretty accurate and able to capture signal pretty fast\nf. Front firing speakers audio is pretty good\ng. Audio through headset is decent\nh. Nice power adapter is provided for external charging and can be charged through USB\ni. Product lives by the brand HP\nj. Pretty sleek and good finish\nk. Great battery and holds charge decently\nl. Comes with all basic required software and some apps from India today group\nm. Best in the market for this price\n\n\nCould have been better:\n\na. Decent audio when we use it directly, can be little louder\nb. Screen could have been more sensitive to sunlight. Need film else get glare\nc. Could have provided a folding cover. We need to purchase everything as add on\nd. Reconsider if you want to use it as phone directly ( Suggest to use Bluetooth or headset)",
            "First of all, a very timely n safely Product Delivery by Flipkart. Hats off to your booking, pricing, shipment procedure. Price wise you people are always reliable and best in class.\n\nHuge disappointment as brand Hp did not worked on many things to satisfy some basic needs which any Voice Tab can provide.\n1. Very poor network reception. One has to switch off phone several times to catch the network again. Even a little drop in network strength vanishes phone's connectivity regarding data as well as call. Hp must work hard on this issue as phone has no re reception of network.\n2. Battery can't last for a single day or full 12 hours.\n3. Sound profiles haven't introduced, thus every time one has to press main on-off key to silent the phone.\n4. Can't Personalize menu or settings as per requirement. Absence of User friendly shortcuts creates time consumption and confusion.\n5. Very low voice output. Earphones are also not effective.\n\nBut if one can ignore these defects, rest all features are superb.\n1. Picture, Video, Touch, Look, Display everything superb.\n2. Finishing too good.\n3. Clarity of Sound hats off, just need to improve voice level.\n4. Typing, Text support, Text input all best in class.\n5. Storage is huge n sufficient.\n\nHP can do much better than this as all these features are exists in laptop n desktops, where HP is master n ahead of all. So always expecting more from Hp.",
            "I got the HP voicetab jus today and I didnt get the tablet from Flipkart, i got it from the HP online store. the main reason i got a tab is i wanted to watch videos and browse and i didnt want to use my phone for that as dese functions will drain the battery soon. My initial choices were Xolo tegranote, Galaxy tab3 7-inch, Dell venue 8, Nexus 2012\n\nPros :\n- Has Dual Sim capability (2G+3G)\n- Has a dashing premium finish/Easy to hold and make calls.\n- Decent Display & has good viewing angles...\nREAD MORE",
            "1. Product is more than Rs. 500 cheaper in Amazon site. Compare before placing order.\n2. About Tab, in nutshell, neither good nor bad.\n3. Samsung Tab3 looks better.\n4. Charging problem. It gets stopped while using Tab.\n5. HP Case/ cover is not easily available in market.\n6. Display quality less attractive. Key pads are dull especially dialling buttons.\n7. Back cover quality is also poor.",
            "Note - I am not writing a review about the product but about the pricing practice of these online retailers.\n\nWith such an advertisement for 6th Oct as biggest online sale on flipkart I see that the price of this product rose from Rs.12499 to well above Rs.14499. TO my amusement WS Retail is selling it at Rs,16999... This is just wow that these retailers still think Indian buyers are stupid.\n\nJust my opinion based on my tracking of prices on Flipkart is that Flipkart does not remain trusted anymore for best price and have certainly been losing to competition. Hope they realize the same.",
            "Bought this tab and it froze after a few weeks of regular use, it froze. I guess this can happen to any electronic product, as long as there are not too many such cases seen, given that millions are manufactured and few can be faulty. What I want to highlight is that the replacement service of Flipkart / WS Retail is too good. I received the replacement within 2 days - no questions asked, no hassles or long waits. I have bought many items from WS Retail and this was the first time I had to ask for a replacement. And the experience gave more faith that this is a very dependable seller.\n\nThe replacement tab is working perfectly fine and I guess it will continue to be so. HP has come out with a wonderful combination of specs at a pretty lucrative price point. Performance is great and with the 3G SIM capability, it just adds on to the bang.",
            "I recently bought it from Flipkart.\n\nA good product from HP @ the reasonable price.\n\nPros:\n> Light weight and very handy.\n> Quality of making was good.\n> Awesome music play with headset.\n> Recommended for browsing and Movies only.\n> Battery backup is very good.\n> internal storage for User available is arround 13 GB.\n> Cloud storage of 25 GB for lifetime.\n\nCons:\n> Lacks of powerful processor.\n> Not suitable for gaming.\nTemple Run2 - no performance impact.\nHill Climb racing - There is a performance issue, when we play with sound enabled in the game.\n> No flash for camera.\n> Camera quality is not as expected.\n> HD display is not so impressed, maybe requires gorilla glass.\n\n\nOverall the product was good and more features for this price,but we cannot compare it with high end devices.",
            "First of all, kudos to flipkart for the quick delivery (within 40 hours).\n\nA brief review of the tablet (after almost a week's use):\nPros: 1. Crystal-clear display with good colour saturation.\n2. Smooth and infallible touch with no lag at all.\n3. Sleek with a sturdy grip and feels comfortable in the hand.\n4. Excellent build quality and textured back-cover.\n5. Fairly respectable processor.\n6. Chrome finishing on the sides.\n7. Runs on stock android and helps keep the UI clutterfree.\n8. Very accurate and responsive accelerometer, magnetometer, gyro sensor and light sensor.\n9. Dual front-firing speakers with good sound clarity.\n10. The internal memory is not partitioned due to which there is more than enough space for apps (>12 GB) and can be joined to an external sd card using third-party apps.\nCons:\n1. Processor is not suitable for very heavy gaming.\n2. No flash, dim light photography is not so good.\n3. Persistent on-screen android buttons always occupy some space.\n4. Sound is clear but volume is not very high (but perfect with earphones).\n5. Does not support OTG.\nOverall: The tablet fulfils my requirements perfectly (reading, surfing, watching movies, playing light games (",

            "First of all, a very timely n safely Product Delivery by Flipkart. Hats off to your booking, pricing, shipment procedure. Price wise you people are always reliable and best in class.\n\nHuge disappointment as brand Hp did not worked on many things to satisfy some basic needs which any Voice Tab can provide.\n1. Very poor network reception. One has to switch off phone several times to catch the network again. Even a little drop in network strength vanishes phone's connectivity regarding data as well as call. Hp must work hard on this issue as phone has no re reception of network.\n2. Battery can't last for a single day or full 12 hours.\n3. Sound profiles haven't introduced, thus every time one has to press main on-off key to silent the phone.\n4. Can't Personalize menu or settings as per requirement. Absence of User friendly shortcuts creates time consumption and confusion.\n5. Very low voice output. Earphones are also not effective.\n\nBut if one can ignore these defects, rest all features are superb.\n1. Picture, Video, Touch, Look, Display everything superb.\n2. Finishing too good.\n3. Clarity of Sound hats off, just need to improve voice level.\n4. Typing, Text support, Text input all best in class.\n5. Storage is huge n sufficient.\n\nHP can do much better than this as all these features are exists in laptop n desktops, where HP is master n ahead of all. So always expecting more from Hp.",
            "I got the HP voicetab jus today and I didnt get the tablet from Flipkart, i got it from the HP online store. the main reason i got a tab is i wanted to watch videos and browse and i didnt want to use my phone for that as dese functions will drain the battery soon. My initial choices were Xolo tegranote, Galaxy tab3 7-inch, Dell venue 8, Nexus 2012\n\nPros :\n- Has Dual Sim capability (2G+3G)\n- Has a dashing premium finish/Easy to hold and make calls.\n- Decent Display & has good viewing angles...\nREAD MORE",
            "1. Product is more than Rs. 500 cheaper in Amazon site. Compare before placing order.\n2. About Tab, in nutshell, neither good nor bad.\n3. Samsung Tab3 looks better.\n4. Charging problem. It gets stopped while using Tab.\n5. HP Case/ cover is not easily available in market.\n6. Display quality less attractive. Key pads are dull especially dialling buttons.\n7. Back cover quality is also poor.",
            "Note - I am not writing a review about the product but about the pricing practice of these online retailers.\n\nWith such an advertisement for 6th Oct as biggest online sale on flipkart I see that the price of this product rose from Rs.12499 to well above Rs.14499. TO my amusement WS Retail is selling it at Rs,16999... This is just wow that these retailers still think Indian buyers are stupid.\n\nJust my opinion based on my tracking of prices on Flipkart is that Flipkart does not remain trusted anymore for best price and have certainly been losing to competition. Hope they realize the same.",
            "Bought this tab and it froze after a few weeks of regular use, it froze. I guess this can happen to any electronic product, as long as there are not too many such cases seen, given that millions are manufactured and few can be faulty. What I want to highlight is that the replacement service of Flipkart / WS Retail is too good. I received the replacement within 2 days - no questions asked, no hassles or long waits. I have bought many items from WS Retail and this was the first time I had to ask for a replacement. And the experience gave more faith that this is a very dependable seller.\n\nThe replacement tab is working perfectly fine and I guess it will continue to be so. HP has come out with a wonderful combination of specs at a pretty lucrative price point. Performance is great and with the 3G SIM capability, it just adds on to the bang.",
            "I recently bought it from Flipkart.\n\nA good product from HP @ the reasonable price.\n\nPros:\n> Light weight and very handy.\n> Quality of making was good.\n> Awesome music play with headset.\n> Recommended for browsing and Movies only.\n> Battery backup is very good.\n> internal storage for User available is arround 13 GB.\n> Cloud storage of 25 GB for lifetime.\n\nCons:\n> Lacks of powerful processor.\n> Not suitable for gaming.\nTemple Run2 - no performance impact.\nHill Climb racing - There is a performance issue, when we play with sound enabled in the game.\n> No flash for camera.\n> Camera quality is not as expected.\n> HD display is not so impressed, maybe requires gorilla glass.\n\n\nOverall the product was good and more features for this price,but we cannot compare it with high end devices.",
            "First of all, kudos to flipkart for the quick delivery (within 40 hours).\n\nA brief review of the tablet (after almost a week's use):\nPros: 1. Crystal-clear display with good colour saturation.\n2. Smooth and infallible touch with no lag at all.\n3. Sleek with a sturdy grip and feels comfortable in the hand.\n4. Excellent build quality and textured back-cover.\n5. Fairly respectable processor.\n6. Chrome finishing on the sides.\n7. Runs on stock android and helps keep the UI clutterfree.\n8. Very accurate and responsive accelerometer, magnetometer, gyro sensor and light sensor.\n9. Dual front-firing speakers with good sound clarity.\n10. The internal memory is not partitioned due to which there is more than enough space for apps (>12 GB) and can be joined to an external sd card using third-party apps.\nCons:\n1. Processor is not suitable for very heavy gaming.\n2. No flash, dim light photography is not so good.\n3. Persistent on-screen android buttons always occupy some space.\n4. Sound is clear but volume is not very high (but perfect with earphones).\n5. Does not support OTG.\nOverall: The tablet fulfils my requirements perfectly (reading, surfing, watching movies, playing light games (",

            "I bought this tab just a few weeks before. Hp being a reputed company, it's products also keeps a standard for usage. In slate 7 also, hp includes the similar finishing and clarity in standards. Its wifi and storage capacity is awesome. The display is much better. Video recording is also better. Also, videos of HQ 720p are being played in a much soothing manner. In short, I really love this tab.",

            "The HP Slate 7 Voice Tab's price is highly fluctuating over few weeks, I got it at 11990/-\nWell, the tab is fantastic.the touch is superb, other features are good, only the network and signal is bit down & the screen resolution is bit disappointing. Even increasing the brightness level to the highest level, it still looks dim beside Samsung Galaxy Tab 2, which is being used by my wife.\nOverall experience is good. The music player is too good and the headphones are better than samsung, iphone and even other reputed brands like Philips.\n\nSo keep an eye on the fluctuating price and book at the lowest possible price. Always try to by from the Seller \"W S Retail\" their delivery and service is the best in the Flipkart.",
            "I bought this tab from flipkart last month. Delivery of the package is excellent as usual.\nBut a good and prompt delivery never make us to ignore about the product qualities that fail to meet our need. I found everything I need for a tablet in it and rated 5 star except one as explained below.\nSIM1 (slot one) supports both 3G and 2G. But network reception is pathetic.\nIn the tablet settings you will not find an option to use only 3G network (like WCDMA only). So the tablet will automatically choose either 2G or 3G according to the signal strength in you area. While there is an option to select and use only 2G, you cannot set it to use only 3G network. This makes internet connection speed or downloading/uploading a hell. If you are looking a tablet for the primary purpose of browsing internet and if you are not from an area where 3G networks strength/signal is strong, don't buy this product.\nBut if you don't bother about this,in its class it is a the best in the rest.",
            "Overall specifications were better than Samsung Tab3 which was selling at about the same price. Fast Flipkart delivery.\n\nFast Quad core Marvell processor, no lag. Comparable to Qualcomm processors.\n\nGood battery life. Runs without charging battery for around 2 days with playing videos, camera (photo and video), WiFi (mostly youtube) and some chrome browsing.\n\nExcellent Wifi connection. Fast and stable even in remote corners of house. My Samsung S duos 2 wifi sucks compared to this tablet.\n\nCamera quality is not upto the mark (photos in low light). But video quality is decent in sufficient light. LED flash would have added lot more value.\n\nCrisp display. Sound is good due to front firing speakers.\n\nOpening back panel was difficult (was scared that it may break while opening). Two sim card slots. One normal sim, other micro sim. Battery is not removable. But I dont want to remove battery. I hope HP will support if battery is to be removed/replaced.\n\nOverall I am quite happy with the purchase.",
            "Looks pretty good but not the same with performance. Just believing on the brand name I bought this tab but really not satisfied with the performance as well as the display. I feel it's not worth the money you pay. Even subway surf doesn't run smoothly. It freezes while having multiple apps run at a time. If you want to play games and watch videos then this might be the wrong choice. Battery backup is really good.",
            "I purchased this device from another vendor. It is an absolute delight. The display is razor sharp. Battery is amazing and lasts a day with medium usage. The only thing that I found somewhat below par is its camera. The camera is average. Also, the device supports two sim at a time (One micro sim with 3G data + one mini sim with 2G data).",
            "PROS:\nBattery : Good - lasts 2 days under moderate usage (doc reading, internet, voice calls, sms)\nDisplay Clarity : Good.\nVoice calls : No Issues. Works Perfectly. (Both Sims)\nMemory : 16 GB Internal\nAudio : Good\nCONS:\nCamera : Both the cameras lack clarity (not at all suitable for taking photos/videos but ok for videocall, skype)\nGaming : faced little lagging few times while playing subway surfers!!!\nSoftware : Stock android so you cant move apps to SD card, i have to limit the number of apps that i use, otherwise device responds slowly (Tried with some 3rd party software also but i can't move apps).\nNo USB-OTG!!! (I knew it before buying)\n\nOthers:\nTill date HP didn't relese or give notification for Kitkat(4.4) upgrade. It'll be good if they do so.",
            "A competitively priced product from HP that offers 2 sim card holders (Mini Micro) Sim Slots.\nI didn't repent in buying this product. Battery life is good enough.\n\nBack panel could be improved upon - so that it would give a rich feel to the user.\non the front side - the display used inside could be even better (Nothing specific to complain on the existing one) but if i compare with some recent roll outs in the market. i feel it could be improved.\n\nDefinitely - need to improve upon the RAM. for regular users - not to worry with this 1GB that it offers.",
            "A very quick and safe delivery by Flipkart like always.\nOverall the HP Tab is very good and surely it's a value for money.\n\nPros:-\n1. Battery backup is very good.\n2. Very good finishing.\n3. Dual Sim. (GSM GSM)\n4. Good choice for storing a moderate amount of media.\n5. High-resolution display.\n6. GPS- able to capture signal very fast.\n7. Audio is pretty good.\n\nCons:-\n1. Charge time 6-8 hrs. just restart this shit and 10% of battery is drained out.\n2. HP Case/ cover is not easily available in market.\n3. Back cover quality is also poor\n4. Camera quality is not up to the mark (photos in low light).\n5. Heating is also a problem in this product.\n6. Does not support OTG.\n7. This tab have only 950 MB RAM , not 1 GB",
            "Have been using this tab for 2 weeks now, and havent faced any problems. Just that it doesnt support USB OTG. but other than that the performance is awesome. No lag problems, Camera front and back is super clear as expected from a 5mp cam. I just hope HP releases its accessories pretty soon.",
            "Its a smartly designed tablet i have ever seen between so many other options available in market. No other tab can beat it in terms of specification. It has everything we need in a tablet. Good job HP. As compared to Samsung Tab or Nexus 7 in terms of price and features.",
            "I am facing issues with this Tab within a week after this purchase. Inside Photo album the \"Delete\" menu item (to delete a selected photo or group of photos) is not appearing. I have reached out to customer care and they have reinstalled the software again but after some day it is disappeared again. This is disgusting as I have to reinstall all the apps again after every reinstallation of this software. This is not at all expected from reputed company like HP!!!",
            "Wow.. I am happy with my purchase. This TAB is better than samsung TAB3. Best value for money and you cant get better feature in this price. And all above this- BRAND-HP :-)\nPros:\nGood battery life\nVery handy\nQuality speakers\nGreat touchscreen\n\nCons:\nOnly problem -Could have provided a folding cover. Accessories are not available anywhere online :-(",
            "Very nice device from HP. When it comes to reliability HP does not disappoint. As always HP devices are long lived and have almost no performance issues. I bought this device about 2 years 6 months back and it is still going strong. I mean given how laggy and frustrating Android devices can be when they get old after everyday use, this device's performance is commendable.\nPros\n1. Economical\n2. 16 GB of ROM really does its job and is more than sufficient\n3. 25 GB lifetime free cloud storage on BOX.com and what else do you need.\n4. Mostly the device is super smooth, with the occasional lags but that is Android's fault, not HP's. Then again it is over 2 yrs old and compared to how other Android devices stop working altogether after 2 yrs, those lags which again are very little in number and frequency are almost nothing.\n5. The camera although 5 MP, is decent.\n6. When 2 MP front camera is thought of we generally cringe, but let me tell you, the 2 MP front camera on this device is nothing like others and is quite impressive for a 2 MP camera.\n7. Headphones given with it are divine.\n\nCons\n1. Network reception is pathetic, probably the only major flaw. But it is super fast on Wifi. Do not use it with 2G mobile network, but it is again very fast with 3G\n2. Speakers could have been louder but the headphones supplied with it are superb in both sound quality, noise cancellation and amplification which do more than make up for it.\n3. 1 GB ram is a bit of a drawback at times but it is not a major issue given ho good its usual performance is\n4. When its OS is upgraded to Kitkat from Jelly Bean its ability to write to external SD cards is lost. So it can no longer write to or delete from SD cards after upgradation but it could read from those very nicely and just like before. So keep its original Jelly Bean OS.\n\nOverall an impressive tablet from HP. Go for it.",
            "Had booked it for a one day delivery and got it in real good condition well packed for safety.Its a good one for basic home use",

Just one of the speakers got water logged.. so sound is not coming properly from one of them.\n\nDere is no use of talking specs as we all know wat dey are giving... coming to the pros adn cons;\n1. the camera is good , in good light and moderate in the dark; gives grains\n2. the front cam is not 2 mp in quality, but yess it gives you decent pics...\n3. 4g not dere\n4. for me it came with a raw android... i dont know why they dont customise it; but i upgraded it to the hps customised kitkat and its working fine\n\n\nas u can see the cons ,.. no major upset is there. all dese are small issues.\nrest all are pros. the camera does its job as is expected from it. The interface is good and the touch is smooth. HD movies run flawlesly and its a delight to watch pirates of the carrbn in full HD in the 7 inch screen. till today i never formatted my phone and still no hangs yet. although i keep running apps all the time . comparable to any good samsung tablet. Battery is also good. lasts 2 days on an avg usage.\nfor gamers, the slate never lets you down, as i play fifa 14 /15 without any lags evr.\nso overall as per performance its the best within this price range. comes with inbuilt google chrome and hp box... its good as a phone evn. smoothly u can make calls. now; i have been a heavyuser as i dont have a phon. this works as my phone also .\nSo my verdict :: dont listen to evryone who speaks.. i am a hardcore user of it for 11 months and still unable to find a bettr performer in tablets. blindly u can go for it.",

Hopefully, that happiness will sustain.\n\nMy observations after the first use:\n1. Easy to use, the UI is easy to use and adapt to.\n2. Its economical and gives a decent config for the price.\n3. The build quality is good with a smooth finish, probably the reason why its a bit heavy? But feels good in hand.\n4. Performance is fine considering my requirements are just for a good browsing experience, Youtube, emails, news, etc among other basic activities.\n5. The speakers are clear and I liked it, it cant be deemed low sounding as I read in a few earlier reviews since it also depends on the music/sound bit rate. The HD videos i watched on youtube sounded nice and load.\n6. Played Subway surfer and there was a bit of a lag though.\n\nAside from the product, Flipkart's delivery was flawless. I ordered the product at 11:45PM and the next day by 11:00AM I received the product! Now that's awesome!!! Packed well and delivered.",
            "I bought it from a local stores recently. What was displayed in Flipkart comparison with other varities was incorrect. It was indicated to have LED Flash - which is not there. I don't know how products are advertised with wrong specifications.\n\nCamera - very good in daylight and for landscape photography.\nSIM - One slot is for a mini-SIM which is not mentioned in advertisement.\nBattery - non-detachable. Battery depletes fast if you are working on internet.\nProcessor is fast and reliable.\n\nOther performances are good, though the speaker volume could have been better. Considering all aspects this should have been priced below 10k because one can go for Intex Smartphones instead of this with almost all similar and even better features",
            "I am writing this review after 1 month of usage. First of all I would like to say that I bought this tablet for gaming and it is performing really well . The display quality is excellent and internet speed is really fast . 16 gb of internal memory is not divided for games , apps , media and things like that u can use the internal memory without any partition , there is no limited space for games , apps and media u can install games and apps until the internal ,memory gets full . You can extend the storage via micro sd card upto 32 gb but still u cannot move apps , games and media to micro sd card . I have installed games upto 1.2 gb but still the internal storage is sufficient for me . The battery has really good standby time .So thus I am trying to say dat without reading these reviews go ahead and buy this product .",
            "This is a nice tablet, screen resolution is excellent, But, the processing speed should be high, and the operating system should be upgraded to WINDOWS 8. Sound quality is manageable, also the battery performance. Overall to say, It is very nice tab, without any hesitation, one should go for it.",
            "Overall experience of the product uptil now is good. Just a month use. Speed n all ok. Battery strenght can be better as well as camera resolution. Otherwise all good feature wise. Just will like to tell HP to hav its own cover case.",

            "The product is awesome, though it took time for me to get accustomed to it. The quad-core processor and 1 GB of RAM, provides seamless browsing, gaming. The 7 inch rich display is awesome. Camera is quite good. Done smooth voice calling without call drop . Battery life is good as compared to other tablets.Audio through headset is decent. The tab is very sleek. Plays HD videos without any kind of lag. It has both 2G/3G support, but I was confused at the first go, then i confirmed SIM2 is only for 2G, SIM1 is for both 3G/2G. I had seen a review about 3G connection, they need to check the sim slot they are using and check with the network provider.",
            "1)The item I ordered had promised that there is a LED flash In primary camera.But the product delievered to me doesnt has the same.\n2)The ear phone supplied with the product doesnt has volume in right ear piece.\n3)Flipkart has promised that the product would be delivered shortly byt it was delevered after 10 days.",

Cannot download free books from play store since no promo code was provided by HP nor flipkart.",

A good product from HP at the reasonable price, as compared to samsung tab neo, Lenovo A3000, and others.\nInitially I loved this, but as the days passed, it started giving problems like, the phone speaker didn't work, restart problem, Boot problem\n\nDo not buy anything from HP ever.\n\nCons-\nNo flash for camera",

            "I always insist on a quality product and this HP Voice Tab Slate 7 is not a disappointment.\nIts got good finish. Great features with A 4.2.2 and sufficient hardware support for that.\n\nONE Great thing about this is its super easy UI, right from the start set up to the guide which can make it easy for 8yr olds to 70yrs grands alike. Thats a plus from HP.\n\nThe box contains additions like headset which I was not expecting as part of standard box.\n\nThe main contention of 7 inch Tabs out there (esp with HP products like laptops) seems to be the battery life. But with a 7 inch IPS this seems to be universal and best way to save on that battery drain is to disable background data, avoid and switch to airplane mode when not in use and screen brightness.\nUnfortunately the tab doesnt update to kitkat from 4.2.2. Thats the Big big drawback.\n\nI'm impressed with the Flipkart service that delivered it before the deadline with a day to spare.",
            "It is a good product and worth the money's buy. the item is working fine. the delivery was at a great speed and very neatly packed for the safety of a sensitive / delicate device.

            "Good tablet. little pricey considering the fact that similar configurations of other brands available with lesser price. Call voice quality not the best. However, it is a good tablet, with sleek design and providing all that is required by me. It satisfied me with overall performance as per my need. One may have this tab in its belongings. GOOD Tab from HP.",

Audio is pretty good.\n\nCons:-\n1. A Little heavier.\n2. 1GB RAM is not sufficient.\n3. The Camera lacks flash.\n4. Camera quality is not as expected.\n5. Could have provided a Book Case Or Cover.\n\nOverall I am satisfied with this Tab from HP and surely I would like to recommend it to others.",
            "My experience using the tablet has been great. The touch can become a problem once in a while needing an additional touch or few such. I haven't had any dissappointments in trying to use it as mostly as an e-book reader and a navigational guide and sparingly as a multimedia device. Inability to share files via Bluetooth from the preloaded HP file manager app would have been one, if play did not throw a free and more comprehensive alternative (x-plore).\nSometimes I wish the apps launched quicker and I switch faster between them. But that is not a dampener, especially after the device survived an accidental fall in the first week of my use like a charm and not a scratch!!\nTo sum up, I like my ware for the limited uses for which I employ it. And it does well when I tread beyond my staple for it.",

If this tablet supports installing or transferring apps to SD cardthen it will be a complete product. If someone has bought it please add it in their review. Else specs are completely awesome and Galaxy Tab 3 & inch or Neo sucks in comparison to this one,",

            "Flipkart Review:\n1. As part of Go Green Initiative, Flipkart no longer give hard copies of Invoice. However i am surprised not to have received even soft copy after three calls and one mail. It is four days now and no mention of Invoice from Flipkart. In malls i have often read board \"Item Free If No Bill !\" Is is applicable even here ;-) ?\n2. In order to promote One and Same day delivery, i have noticed delay in standard delivery timelines.\n\nUpdate: Just communicated with Flipkart to understand the reason for failure to provide me Invoice Copy. Was surprised with the attitude of Executive who said THAT IT IS ACCEPTABLE AND COMMON TO MISS INVOICE COPY AS COMPANY DOES 1 LAKH TRANSACTIONS A DAY. Executive refused to take a complaint and also denied taking feedback to improve. Wonder has Flipkart ever heard of Six Sigma ?\n\nHP Voice Tab Review:\n1. Voice clarity is terrific.\n2. Poor Camera.\n3. Tab can be connected to system as Mass Media Device and not as USB Device which is common in many android devices. This results in slow transfer rates.\n4. No sluggishness or slowness of device. Smooth like butter. Standard Default Android UI used.\n5. Front speakers are great and nice to watch movie.",
            "I placed my order from the seller WS Retail for this tab on March 29th and I received the product well packed yesterday. I was super impressed by the time taken for delivery.\n\nThe Tablet came in a sealed HP box. I am using it since yesterday and i am quite happy with it. The only thing i noticed is the tab heats up easily. Nothing major though.. May be because i am excited and using it non-stop. Will update after a few weeks of usage.\n\nThe product is shipped through ekart logistics and their chennai office DON'T HAVE A CONTACT NUMBER. Their national call centre number do not work either.",

            "> First of all thanks to flipkart for its customer service, unlike other online retailers (where price differ only by Rs. 10-20 but Extremely disappointed Service)\n\nAdvantages:\n\n> KitKat Upgrade Available\n> Scratch-free Display (not Gorilla Glass but Rough Handling doesnt do much damage even Scratch)\n> Good camera (Certainly not the best)\n\nDisadvantages :\n\n> Battery Backup is comparatively less\n> No Drivers available (after upgrade to 4.4.2)\n> In build apps\n> dents at outer cover and side (if rough handled bt didnt break)\n\nOverall, Best Tablet for Budget Price, I recommend HP",

Even the tab restart is also not working in this case.\n\n2) When i am using the USB cable as a charger then the tab touch stop responding or responds in incorrect manner.\n\n3) Lot of problems with charger , sometime it stops charging the tab.\n\n4) Very less service center. You can not get the answers for your problems in the tab.\n\n5) Whenever i am inserting the micro SIM with the another SIM in the tab. It automatically restarts again and again.",

            "My first purchase from Flipkart and very happy!\n\nAfter researching on a tab for my parents, I decided to go for HP Slate 7 voice tab and I'm happy with the choice. Hopefully, that happiness will sustain.\n\nMy observations after the first use:\n1. Easy to use, the UI is easy to use and adapt to.\n2. Its economical and gives a decent config for the price.\n3. The build quality is good with a smooth finish, probably the reason why its a bit heavy? But feels good in hand.\n4. Performance is fine considering my requirements are just for a good browsing experience, Youtube, emails, news, etc among other basic activities.\n5. The speakers are clear and I liked it, it cant be deemed low sounding as I read in a few earlier reviews since it also depends on the music/sound bit rate. The HD videos i watched on youtube sounded nice and load.\n6. Played Subway surfer and there was a bit of a lag though.",
