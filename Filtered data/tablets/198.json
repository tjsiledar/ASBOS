            "Hi friends! This is an average tablet. I did a detailed review in my youtube channel TechKnowLogical. You can find out there.\n\nAs per my experience I can tell you that it's suitable for students, who need tablet for study purpose only. For media consumption also, it's fairly well. But forget about heavy gaming or high end app such as video editing etc. The major problem I found is that it's touch is not very responsive and of course it's SoC is not that great so can't expect great performance on gaming front.\n\nBattery backup is quite good though, if I turn on the airplane mode then I can enjoy 8-9 hrs of non stop movie. I guess you can judge it's battery performance. And one more thing, it's not VoLTE, I don't know why it's featured as VoLTE tablet.\n\nI got this tablet in 7300/- so I can't complain. In that price it's quite good tablet, but otherwise it's very mediocre tablet. Hope this help.. peace",
            "READ THIS REVIEW TO DECIDE WHETHER BUY THIS PRODUCT OR NOT!\nAlcatel A3 10 is a 10.1 inch tablet with Mediatek processor clocked 1.1 ghz which is quite low for tablets these days.\nProcessor :\nFrom my usage experience, this product is very sluggish even though it is running near stock android. This may turn off some users who want to do quick multitasking on this device. I opened 5-7 tabs of various apps and the the tab almost slowed down to halt. I would not definitely recommend this for gaming and multitasking. I fear if what the performance will be in an year from now.\n3/10\n\nDisplay:\nThe display is 720p and is very average by far. It looks uncrisp and quite blurry looking at it close by. That's not to say that is unusable but if you are thinking of something close to likes of MI Pad or Apple iPad, you'll be disappointed. Though it expected at this price and display size. I might say that this size is great experience for me in reading ebooks.\n\nNext I tried using it for watching downloaded TV shows. Had watched stranger things season 2 at 720p, no issues faced but keep in mind not to try watching anything more than 720p, the display does not scale down and you'll face lots of hangups and grey screens.\n5/10\n\nCamera:\nGARBAGE. You'll take better photos with a potato attached with wiring. Don't buy if you are thinking of using it to take wedding pics or vacation pictures.\n1/10\n\nSound:\nIn this aspect it has no competition, the sound is better than high end tablets and laptops. The sole one and only reason I would recommend this product for. The sound from the two front speakers are loud and clear. I keep the volume at 20% and it is loud enough to watch videos enjoyably. Best for those who dislike using headphones. Buy this if you're a ardent music listener.\n10/10\n\nBattery:\nLasts long enough for the day thanks to its underclocked processor. Would update in future in an year to see how it is.\n8/10\n\nConnectivity :\n4G and VoLTE enabled tablet, works well with Jio and Airtel 4G networks on which I've tested.\n8/10\n\nThe system ships with usual bloatware like flipkart app, app store by Alcatel and Google trash like play movies, play music etc which cannot be Uninstaller.\nOther apps included are facebook, messenger, Instagram, wps office which can be uninstalled.\n\nOther than above aspects, I would recommend buying it if you want simple media playback, web surfing and for reading ebooks. You can do light gaming as well.\n\nNOT RECOMMENDED IF YOU ARE A POWER USER AND WANT TO USE CUSTOM ROMS, MEDIATEK DEVICES HAVE NO ACTIVE DEVELOPER COMMUNITY.",
            "Ordered it on day 1.. with a 35% off, got it for 6.4K. Performance is good.\n\nPros -\nHD display with 10 inch, very good for watching movies.\nDual speaker are very good.\ngot headset along with the device which is also good.\nBattery is good.\nOK RAM of 2 GB atleast 1 GB is free most of the time to use more apps.\nsplit screen option is great, you can do multi tasking.\nDual SIM is good.\nDevice is good for both Official and personal usage, like mailing, browsing, kids education etc. Didn't try games, not interested.\nTouch is OK.\n\nCons -\nlooks very cheap due to plastic build. Already the sim card slot lid is loose.\nGot a screen guard along with the device. it is of low quality. Glass one would have been great.\n16 GB ROM is very less, would have been good if it was 32 GB at least.\nI feel the WIFI is a bit slow with the device.\nDevice Hangs for a sec and comes back. Happened twice already. But doesn't seem to be a great problem.\nNo VoLTE support.\n\n\nbottom line, for a 6.4K its a very good buy. Go for it..",
            "Best for exam preparation. Do not expect too much quality. This is worth what we pay for. For a mediatek processor performance is so smooth. Received update for VoLTE on 27/09/2017. After receiving update go to settings > wireless settings > more > mobile networks> enable enhanced LTE . screen viewing angles are very good. Audio quality and output is best part of this tablet. Battery backup lasts for one n half day. Instead of Kindle readers and over priced Lenovo tabs which are not more than 8 inches , Alcatel A3 10 is the only best choice left. Thanks to Alcatel.",
            "it's really fantastic I really love that such a big screen such a good working condition such a nice deal actually...was totally satisfied with the tab loved surely should go with it",
            "Speed, sound and convenience to handle are plus points. Display is the only downside I noticed so far. Basically it is a 10 inch, big display. But the screen resolution is only 1280x800. Not really enough to give good hinting and anti-aliasing for the screen fonts. And most of the applications are not built for the screen size. For example, when you open the settings application, there is a lot of space left on both sides. Same with the pull down notification and quick access menu. It is really small and doesn't fill the screen at all.\n\nWhen playing full screen video, however, bigger display is very useful. Sound is really nice and speakers are on the front. I can keep it on the bed and still hear the sound. Very light weight for the size. Plastic feels fragile. Screen guard is included in the package. If your regular use is playing videos, surfing and reading, it is really worth the price.",
            "Brilliant Product, Excellent & Fast touch Quality, Big Display, Sufficient Spaces, Camera Quality is good Overall Product is very good.",
            "It's been an month that I'm using and tab performance is very good so for. It's very useful for reading books and watching videos. First you feel it's big but when you get use to it you will definitely love it's performance. I barley opens my laptop after getting tab. Game performance is also very nice.",

            "READ THIS REVIEW TO DECIDE WHETHER BUY THIS PRODUCT OR NOT!\nAlcatel A3 10 is a 10.1 inch tablet with Mediatek processor clocked 1.1 ghz which is quite low for tablets these days.\nProcessor :\nFrom my usage experience, this product is very sluggish even though it is running near stock android. This may turn off some users who want to do quick multitasking on this device. I opened 5-7 tabs of various apps and the the tab almost slowed down to halt. I would not definitely recommend this for gaming and multitasking. I fear if what the performance will be in an year from now.\n3/10\n\nDisplay:\nThe display is 720p and is very average by far. It looks uncrisp and quite blurry looking at it close by. That's not to say that is unusable but if you are thinking of something close to likes of MI Pad or Apple iPad, you'll be disappointed. Though it expected at this price and display size. I might say that this size is great experience for me in reading ebooks.\n\nNext I tried using it for watching downloaded TV shows. Had watched stranger things season 2 at 720p, no issues faced but keep in mind not to try watching anything more than 720p, the display does not scale down and you'll face lots of hangups and grey screens.\n5/10\n\nCamera:\nGARBAGE. You'll take better photos with a potato attached with wiring. Don't buy if you are thinking of using it to take wedding pics or vacation pictures.\n1/10\n\nSound:\nIn this aspect it has no competition, the sound is better than high end tablets and laptops. The sole one and only reason I would recommend this product for. The sound from the two front speakers are loud and clear. I keep the volume at 20% and it is loud enough to watch videos enjoyably. Best for those who dislike using headphones. Buy this if you're a ardent music listener.\n10/10\n\nBattery:\nLasts long enough for the day thanks to its underclocked processor. Would update in future in an year to see how it is.\n8/10\n\nConnectivity :\n4G and VoLTE enabled tablet, works well with Jio and Airtel 4G networks on which I've tested.\n8/10\n\nThe system ships with usual bloatware like flipkart app, app store by Alcatel and Google trash like play movies, play music etc which cannot be Uninstaller.\nOther apps included are facebook, messenger, Instagram, wps office which can be uninstalled.\n\nOther than above aspects, I would recommend buying it if you want simple media playback, web surfing and for reading ebooks. You can do light gaming as well.\n\nNOT RECOMMENDED IF YOU ARE A POWER USER AND WANT TO USE CUSTOM ROMS, MEDIATEK DEVICES HAVE NO ACTIVE DEVELOPER COMMUNITY.",
            "Ordered it on day 1.. with a 35% off, got it for 6.4K. Performance is good.\n\nPros -\nHD display with 10 inch, very good for watching movies.\nDual speaker are very good.\ngot headset along with the device which is also good.\nBattery is good.\nOK RAM of 2 GB atleast 1 GB is free most of the time to use more apps.\nsplit screen option is great, you can do multi tasking.\nDual SIM is good.\nDevice is good for both Official and personal usage, like mailing, browsing, kids education etc. Didn't try games, not interested.\nTouch is OK.\n\nCons -\nlooks very cheap due to plastic build. Already the sim card slot lid is loose.\nGot a screen guard along with the device. it is of low quality. Glass one would have been great.\n16 GB ROM is very less, would have been good if it was 32 GB at least.\nI feel the WIFI is a bit slow with the device.\nDevice Hangs for a sec and comes back. Happened twice already. But doesn't seem to be a great problem.\nNo VoLTE support.\n\n\nbottom line, for a 6.4K its a very good buy. Go for it..",
            "Best for exam preparation. Do not expect too much quality. This is worth what we pay for. For a mediatek processor performance is so smooth. Received update for VoLTE on 27/09/2017. After receiving update go to settings > wireless settings > more > mobile networks> enable enhanced LTE . screen viewing angles are very good. Audio quality and output is best part of this tablet. Battery backup lasts for one n half day. Instead of Kindle readers and over priced Lenovo tabs which are not more than 8 inches , Alcatel A3 10 is the only best choice left. Thanks to Alcatel.",
            "it's really fantastic I really love that such a big screen such a good working condition such a nice deal actually...was totally satisfied with the tab loved surely should go with it",
            "Speed, sound and convenience to handle are plus points. Display is the only downside I noticed so far. Basically it is a 10 inch, big display. But the screen resolution is only 1280x800. Not really enough to give good hinting and anti-aliasing for the screen fonts. And most of the applications are not built for the screen size. For example, when you open the settings application, there is a lot of space left on both sides. Same with the pull down notification and quick access menu. It is really small and doesn't fill the screen at all.\n\nWhen playing full screen video, however, bigger display is very useful. Sound is really nice and speakers are on the front. I can keep it on the bed and still hear the sound. Very light weight for the size. Plastic feels fragile. Screen guard is included in the package. If your regular use is playing videos, surfing and reading, it is really worth the price.",

No need to charge 2nd time in a single day even after heavy uses.\nOutdoor visibility of screen is tremendous, I keep its brightness at 50-60% even in direct sunlight.\nSuper speaker output, dual stereo speakers performs better than expectation.\nCalling is good, Jio sim using Jio4Gvoice app(no volte)\n\n\nNow there are some cons... which are really not big issues...(atleast for me)\n\nNo physical LED notification\nNo vibrator (yes, no vibrator, probably the reason of good battery)\nAverage cameras (both)\nOkOk touch response\nRAM management is just OK...\n\nOverall you can see. .. cons are nothing in front of pros for a tablet at this price.. this tab is perfect for Reading books, news papers(Jio news app), magazines(Jiomag app), video watching, and (I don't play games but you can)..?\n\n\n\nImportant Update....27-09-017\n\nGot volte update yesterday...now Jio voLTE is supported by this tablet...\n\n\nNice performance yet",

Sometimes it hangs but still it's fine.\nThe sound is great.\nDon't expect a good cam.\nThe only reason I bought this tablet because it's 10\" and for me it's worth it.\nIt's comfortable while reading stuff.

            "Couldn't have asked for better tab in that price range. It gives enough of everything what we need. Great product from Alcatel.\nPros:\n- VFM\n- 10.1 inch display with surprisingly good picture quality& viewing angles\n- Very loud dual speakers\n- 4g connectivity\n- Very slim\n- Required pre-installed apps, no bloatware\n- Good camera features\n- Very useful features like night mode, double tap, 3-finger screenshot etc\n\nCons:\n- Mediocre camera quality\n- Touchscreen touch is a bit disappointing, not that responsive",
            "Really a great buy. It supports jio volte that I did not expect. At least viewing few reviews of other buyers I thought it won't support volte. Everything is great except display, touch experience could be better. One more thing battery is really excellent.",
            "You can't get a 10 inches tab in this price. This is my 2nd same product. I bought one 2 years back for my wife and this time gifted one to my father. Even the 2 year old one is also working fine. Touch is not very smooth but don't expect heaven in this price.",
            "I love the product .help me to study a lot in eassy way .i think this best tab love it..love it. Used for mostly students",
            "I got this product for INR 7199 during BBD.\n\nPros:\n1. This tablet is insanely big for this price. I am kidding not. 10 inch screen makes a whole lot of difference.\n2. Very nice interface and does not lag during normal usage. No heating so far.\n3. Supports HD display, so HD videos play like charm on this tablet.\n4. There is a screenguard sent along, so that avoids you hunting for a suitable one.\n\nCons:\n1. Very thin line of rainbow pixels have started to appear on the bottom of the screen. This perhaps might have happened during screenguard installation.\n2. Camera quality is really poor I must admit. But that's not my primary purpose of using this tablet, hence does not matter much.\n\nOverall I'd say it's more than worth at 7k. If you are looking for a tablet in the 10k ish range, go for this. I personally did a lot of research before buying this and I found this to be the best in this price segment. Even if it was for 10k, I would have probably gone ahead and purchased this one.\n\nCheers.",
            "I am delighted with this tablet and recommend it as being a reliable and safe choice for anyone who is looking for a ten inch tablet. The tablet is very light in weight, smart to look at, has a non-skid-easy-to-grip back cover and does not get heated, making it easy to hold for hours. The battery seems to last forever, even with several hours of video viewing and internet usage: I don't even have to charge it every day. The quality of the screen resolution is very good, the sound surprising very loud and not tinny in quality. The wifi streams seamlessly and I have not had any issues so far in the two weeks I have used it. Flipkart added to the delight when this was delivered in 24 hours at no extra cost. Highly recommend it for anyone who is looking for a large size tablet, that is no fuss and easy to use. Been using it for six months\nand have had no problems at all.",
            "Excellent product .... Very nice. I got it just only at price 7199\u20b9 on big million day. Highly recommended for study purpose and movies watching having very good speakers and above avg hd quality. Just go for it.",
            "Sound is great. 4g Volte rocks. Processor is slightly lagging but still ok. Don't bother about Camera quality.\n\nWorst thing is low quality display for such huge screen. Not at all good for reading and even hd movie watching sucks. While reading, it seems highly pixelated and really tiresome. If ur purpose is reading, avoid those 5 star ratings and pls don't choose it.\n\nFinally I have been a trusted customer of Flipkart since long. But this time one star less for Flipkart policy of non-returning the products, especially things like Alcatel that u have never had hand on before.\n\nConclusion:- Readers never ever buy this product. Flipkart should restore Return policy instead of just Replacement otherwise many customers like me have already started thinking of other options. Thanks.",

It is adequate for my photography needs for viewing and displaying my images. Though, I would have loved had it been Full HD.\nSound - The speakers on the tablet are fabulous. Loud and clear. Watching movies or playing rhymes for my children is a very pleasant experience.\nTouch - The touch on the tablet is very smooth and precise. A friend of mine who has a Samsung tablet found the touch to be similar.\nBattery - Though my usage of the tablet is intense only during weekends, a full charge works easily for me for throughout the day. With minimal usage, I think I could get it to run for 3 days without a charge.\nFeatures - I am happy that I have the latest Android. The software provided pre-loaded are not bloated. I have kept my software installations to a minimum. I haven't seen any lag or slowness in the tablet. Though I would have preferred a higher amount of RAM.",

            "Writing this review after my kids have been playing with this for over 14 days now.\n\nI have always been a fan of Stereo sound in tablets, I had chinese M3 Movie and chinese Tbook 10 earlier. Pipo lasted over 4 years while Teclast conked off in 4 months (bad memory - bricked). This is the only tablet I found that had stereo speakers placed nicely on the edges to provide widest separation. When I heard the tablet first time it was really the best I have heard compared to my previous tablets. In fact, at night it is too loud even at minimum (just above 0) .. so have to reduce it to 0 at times. But really sound is great while playing games and listening to music in Google Play (you should disable equalizer in Google Play music to get higher loudness). However, while watching movies the volume was not adequate. which could be due to the content itself.\n\nFor the price, this is great, build quality is good, battery lasts quite well, 2 GB RAM and 16 GB storage is very adequate. Screen resolution is acceptable though full HD would have been really great. Screen brightness is also good, I just keep it a notch above minimum to minimize battery drain.\n\nCamera is below average (I dont care about it anyway on 10 inch tab). If you want to scan docs using this (or any other mobile) keep the tablet/mobile on a table with camera protruding out of the edge of table and keep the document under the camera on a chair etc. with right height, have good light falling on the document, and then touch the click button lightly (you can even put a 2 sec timer) ..this will ensure there is no camera shake and you will obtain much better results even with this not so great camera.\n\nOn the software side, it has latest Android Nougat which has the cool feature of running two apps side by side. It comes with Alcatel launcher so there few undesirable apps that cannot be disabled. There is some lag while scrolling etc. sometimes but not too annoying. Most games can be played. My son plays Minecraft, Angry Birds Rio etc, Modern Combat.. little lag is there in Real Racing 3. Real Steel works fine. You can also have multiple accounts / guest account configured in Android as in previous tablet versions of Android. You can add shortcuts in the Navigation Bar (where Home,Back,Apps buttons are there typically).\n\nThe tablet also supports 2G / 3G / LTE network for voice calling and data and takes in a Micro Sim. For voice I tried Jio sim few days back but could not find VoLTE feature anywhere at that time. I was able to make calls with Jio using the Jio app. Now, today I got a system update and after that an option for Enhance LTE for voice and other communication is added in Mobile Networks section, which I think will enable native calling from Jio sim. However, I could not test it. Today I tested network speed with Airtel Sim and good signal but results were not great..~1Mbps download and ~2.5Mbps upload, in fact speed in 3G was better than 4G. Cant say anything conclusively as network condition can vary greatly.\n\nTried 2G calls as well and worked fine.. note that the tablet always remains in speakerphone mode while in calls, you cannot turn off speaker phone.\n\nFor WiFi, tablet supports 2.4G networks only, no support for 5G.\n\nOverall I think it's a great product at sweet price.",
            "The product is very nice.. picture quality 4/5\nSond is 4/5..\nBut very nice tab in this price\nAnd this time very fast diliver for flipkart..\nNice feel for watching movies and games\nNo doubt in this Tab.. buy this product...\nI like this tab.. thank you flipkart this time you buy me new product.. last time u buy use item ..",
            "Got it for a real good price. let's straight get into pros and cons.\n\ncons:\n1. performance is below par. hangs if 3-4 apps runs in the background. frezzes frames sometimes. YouTube hangs in 720p. entire UI feels sluggish.\n2. battery is not so good. around 3.5 hours of screen on time. not used with a sim. only using with WiFi. also usage of speakers drains lot of battery. changing mode to battery saver saves battery a bit, so try that settings.\n3. built quality is avarage. makes squarky sound when picked up. It may not last if my daughter sits in it!!!!!\n4. Volume button and power button is easily pressed if the tab is kept vertically. buttons are not textured, which makes it difficult to find.\n5. Camera, as known, does not serve any purpose. the front cam in video calling is almost unusable.\n6. could not find any way to cast screen to smart tv or any other device.\n7. charging is super slow. even with 10 watt charger takes 4 hours to charge. also if you use it while charging, the battery percentage drops.\n8. Updates - have security updated till aug. 2017. no one should expect software or security update here.\n9. would have loved physical orientation switch, HDMI port and face unlock. pin unlock is painful. u need to enter pin and click OK everytime.\n10. you can't get proper accessories for this tab. no proper back cover available. only generic cases!!!\nPros.\n1. sound : the volume is awesome. you can literary feel the stereo effect. it's better than any tab or laptop i used. clean and clear.\n2. display : display is colourful. has good viewing angles. gets too much bright at night even with minimum brightness though. but good for the one thing it's made for, media consumption. it's big and vibrant.\n3. OS : Naugat out of the box makes it run almost all latest software. it's almost stock, so have nice toggles in drop down menu, like choice of Bluetooth device comes in the drop-down menu itself when clicked on Bluetooth toggle. Maping navigation bar and adding shortcuts there is a nice touch.\n4. value for money : Got it for 6k. No other 10 inch tablet comes at that price. 100 percent value for money.\n\nconclusion : best for media consumption under 9k. easy to hold light tab. i can recommend this. don't use for other heavy work. 720p is underwhelming, but brightness and colour makes it up at this price.",
            "Bought it about 6 months back for 9999. I am satisfied with it.\nPros:\nBig screen.\nImpressed with the viewing angles.\nLouder than smartphones(dual speakers)\nGood Battery Backup\nAndroid Nougat\nGreat for reading ebooks.\nPhotos clicked acceptable.\nGets only a little heated.\nwatching movies(720p) is pleasure.\n\nCons:\nNot at all suitable for heavy gaming.\nHangs on watching 720p videos on YouTube.\nMany apps are not compatible with the tablet.\nNo software updates from Alcatel (only one to include volte)\nVideos captured are low quality.\nDon't know why but using sd card slowed it down.\navailable internal memory 10.7 gb only.\nMovies bigger than about 500 mb do not work.(works when on external USB)\n\nVerdict:\nIt is a great tablet and probably the best under 10000. Recommended for Ebook reading and light gaming. There are some problems but it is what you expect from tablet in this range.",
            "It is an amazing product. Literally got more than what I expected. I'm glad I chose to buy this product. Watching movie and surfing through the net is an amazing experience. And it is unexpectedly fast. Touch isn't that effective but it's not that poor.. Camera quality ain't that good. Apart from that I'm a happy customer. Flipkart delivered it before the estimated time. A big thanks to Flipkart!!!",
            "Review for Flipkart : Great deal, Flexible delivery timing.\nAlcatel A3 10 Tablet : Nice Tablet at decent price.\n\nI have been searching for a tablet with latest Android version and good spec since long. There are no Tablet around this price that meets the Specs of A3 10.\n\nExcellent Tablet for reading news paper, online content, watching movie. Good for games as well.",
            "I was new to the Alcatel Product. So I decided to buy A3 10. But keeping in mind Flipkart's Return policy I ordered this Tablet. Delivery was superb. I received in 2 days. But I was not satisfied with the display and performance quality of this tablet, so I decided to replace it with another one of Samsung.But Flipkart representative clearly denied over the replacement. So I am forced to use this Tablet.\nNow After using tablet for about 2 days my opinion for this tablet are:\nPros: * Good in Android because it's Having Nougat.\n\n* Great price and feature combination and placement in this range of tablet. Because there are no other good options available as of now in India to buy.\n\n\nCons: Display not good\nPerformance not as good as Samsung\n* Not disclosed the processor used\n* Plastic Quality used in back panel is very bad and gets pressed while holding and watching any multimedia content.",
            "I got this tab in 7200/-. But it is worth 10k. There is no tab in the market with this nearly similar specifications. It is comparatively lite weight, slim. This tab is horizontally wider than other brands. Also the back camera is on side instead of center. So back covers would be hard to get. I also could not find a tempered glass for it. If you are a movie lover, it is better to watch movies in this wide display tab than other square tabs. Battery life is very good. Display and sound is good in this range.",
            "Plus\nNo heat while getting charge and using\nGood battery back up even 4600 mah\nAptimum ram space\nGood price with this spec by comparing all available tablets\nGood touch sensitivity\nGood sound effects on dual speaker\nGood display clarity\nPrice compatibility\nMinus\nWhen delete some items from the file manager the free space showing not get refresh immediately( may be software problem of mine )\nI got single sim slot and a memory slot but in spec they mentioned dual sim slot\nNeed more internal memory atleast 32 GB\nSpare parts feasibility\nVoLTE Missing\nAvg rear cam but better in day times\nI suggested this tab for students who preparing competitive exams. Very useful for study purpose.\nThanks for Alcatel,flipkart and indiflashmart for providing such a valuable product for reasonable price",
            "Super tablet. I got within 24 hrs delivery from flipkart. It works nicely .\nHd display is super\nEar set working nice , sound quality also good.\nThis is the best tablet in this price range. Really worthy.",
            "A very value for money product. Good to use if only want to watch movies, read documents and surf a little bit. Beyond that it's difficult. Battery backup of about five hours with continuous video playback along with downloading in the back ground. Without internet it would 1-1.5 hours. Little bigger battery would have been appreciated. Camera is not good. UI is close to stock and and pretty smooth. Provides 10gb of free space. Build quality is okay. Charging takes about 4-4.5 hours to full charge from 15%. Screen resolution is good but at times feels a little hazy. Speakers are very loud but at full volume vibrates the whole device.\n\nAt 7k it is value for money buy and I'm satisfied. At 10k not worth it.",
            "Awesome Product at this Price Point:\n\n1. Very good battery backup\n2. Great sound quality\n3. Display could be better by having a 1080p screen but at this price point its decent.\n4. No issues of heating.\n5. Light weight.",
            "It's a great tab I got it in offer on big billion day with sbi card offer as well... Once you power on do the update... It supports volte once updated.... Great tab awesome to have.... Smooth touch no issues... Not sure why some users say it has issue.. I doubt they even purchased it... The reason it shows verified purchase for them is I guess they place order as Cod write review and cancel the order.. So don't trust such reviews... Now a days if you want something just buy and test... Alcatel is great brand they won't make low performance product... Remember their phones are always best",
            "After using 1 year approx, I have come to this conclusion:\nPros\n- 10 inch HD display. Good for movies, books, games.\n- 2 GB RAM is good enough for running chrome browser. No lagging in games also. 1 GB memory free most of the time.\n- Battery backup is very good. You can watch 2 movies and play some shooting games, surf internet still you have 50% battery remaining.\n- Speakers are loud enough and sounds ok. There are dual speaker, No need of headphone for watching movies.\n- Earphone included in the package. which is good.\n- You will get one screen guard free.\n- There is a split screen features where you can run 2 apps at one time that is cool.\n- This device is good for watching movies, mailing, internet surfing, some gaming (not high end). You can do almost all your daily activity with this device.\n- Low weight help you to carry for a long time.\n- Camera quality is ok for tablet. Not expect more.\n\nCons\n- 16 GB ROM is less these days, but you can manage this with 32 GB sdcard.\n\nconclusion:\nBest 10 inch tablet in this price range. Go for it.",

            "Bought this on sale time and got very good price for it around 6k which is incredible for 10\" screen with 16gb internal storage and 2gb ram.

            "i got this tab in 6299/- in offer period..\nit is good for normal use like reading pdf, watching video or movies, using whats App or any other social media apps, it is also good for surfing, fast downloading, jio works fine and wifi is also supporting well, camera is not good , video recording is poor quality,,,\n\nif you store or keep more items or if you install more apps or heavy games in internal memory .. it will hang.. it is not for heavy gaming...\n\n\notherwise .. this tab is fantabulous",
            "A value for money offering best used as a media consumption device. The dual front facing speakers are good and the screen is acceptable for the price. Battery life too is good for its size. Don't expect good gaming performance or multi tasking as the processor is not up to the mark. A worthy contender if looking for a big screen media device.",
            "Don't just think, Go for it.\nBefore buying this tab I was little doubtful because Alcatel is not that much famous as other brands. But after getting this in my hand and using it for about a week, I can say Alcatel A3 is a master piece considering its price (I got it @ Rs 7999 in sale). It is light weight considering its 10 inch screen and easy to hold in hands because of good gripping texture provided on the back panel. It has very neat & clean interface. There is no heating problem at all. Camera is average.\nI am not into gaming so I cannot comment on gaming performance but this is perfectly suitable for reading books, magazines, notes etc. and watching videos.",
            "Nice tab..in this price range\nI got it for an effective price of 7999\nAndroid 7.0 out of the box\n2gb RAM with 16gb Internal around 10gb usable.\nsupports Jio VOLTE, supports calling as well overall a descent tab with 10inch screen at this price range, performance is also descent considering the price range.\nThe only issue which I feel after using the tab for around a month is that there is some lag in the video streaming online and sometimes even while playing movie/video's stored in the tab.",
            "I bought this tab for studying purposes, so my rating is based solely on my experience reading PDF files and using educational apps. The tab came with a screen guard. It is decent enough to carry around while reading. The things I don't like is that it doesn't have adaptive brightness and the headphone slot is not proper",
            "I'm giving it 4stars because of the delayed delivery. Rest packaging was great! Product looks mediocre but first impression is good for a 10k tablet. Will give a full review after 2 months usage.\n\nOk... update after 4 months continuous usage:\n\nBattery exceeds my expectations. I used it mainly for reading and watching YouTube videos. Lasts more than you expect. Sound is more than enough. Tab vibrates as it has two powerful speakers. Display is good for reading and watching videos for time pass. Tab lags on playing 720p vid. Processor is not so good. Forget about playing games. You can only use this tab for watching videos and specifically reading. But don't expect too much at this price range. No heating issues. Charging takes 4hr+ time. Night read mode for soothing experience at night time reading. I will strongly recommend 32 gb variant. Value for money is 9/10.",

NOT SUITABLE FOR GAMING\n4. Below Average Cameras\n\nThis tablet is good for reading e-books, thanks to its big display. The main drawback is its processor, that's simply not good for heavy tasks. Moreover, this device should receive a permanent price cut of atleast Rs.2000, making Alcatel a more aggressive player in sub-10000 tablet market in India. The device should be worth of only 7500 to 8000 rs. This tablet should be an ideal pick for Rs.8000",

Thanks flipkart and Alcatel for such an awesome product.",

Ultimate sound output.\n4. 2 GB RAM with 1.1 GHz CPU is sufficient for multi tasking.\n5. Light in weight.\n\nCons:\n1. Battery backup. Full charge will last one day with moderate use.",
            "Got it in big billion sale at 8000 .. at this price i must say its a good buy , everything is fine except the camera (very poor) and ppi is also 149 so screen appers laggy and less defined other than this its a good buy for watching movies, surfing,reading and gaming (obviously not high ended games) battrey back up is good and you also get a screen guard with it , jio 4g works absolutely fine with it .. so all n all i am satisfied with this tab",
            "Full value for money tablet 7250/- big billion sale. Only drawback is tiny text like in newspaper websites is a strain on the eyes since this is low pixels only 149ppi and not full HD but becomes clear once zoomed in enlarged though takes visible time to re-adjust and camera is low quality slow and far below average. Other features are excellent. Amazing sound not even found in high end tablets. I also have iPad , Mipad and Galaxy TabS. They are like BMW, Mercedes Benz and this one is like Maruti Swift in cars. 1.1ghz quad core processor is not a let down. Can play graphic intensive games without anything else running in background so clear memory before playing a game or even reboot. Would have preferred a 2 ghz processor which would have made this product great at 10k comparing to xioami mipad which gives high end components for less price. 2 GB ram is a bonus on this device.\nAnother aspect to note is that the outer display surface is not completely flat and is wavy towards speaker edges making it impossible to fit a custom tempered glass. The company does not specify that it uses dragon trail glass for protection so please be careful not to drop the tablet anywhere else that would be its last day, the screen is fragile and costly to replace around 7k.\nLastly, perform a system update before using the tablet.",
            "I am using it for a week. I really liked the product, although I feel fragile in holding it though. Fortunately you will receive update which will upgrade it to support VoLTE. I 've been using jio sim in it.\nPros:\n1) VoLTE support on update.\n2) no lag/Sluggishness whilst multitasking.\n3) Loud speakers. Good to watch movies/ tutorial videos.\n4) large screen, easy to read PDF books, news, mails, etc.\n\nCons:\n1) doubt in build quality.\n2) screen guard provided is the plastic one, not much useful.\n3) can't put the call on speaker.\n\nFinal Verdict: This is a good product for students to use it for their studies and daily use. I would really suggest to improve their build quality and display. Expected a bit bigger battery as well.",

You Can enjoy your small laptop works here like excel, Ms office and much more. Tablet size is 10.1 inch and with body 12.6 Inch.

This tab at this price is absolutely great.. anyone who is looking for a big screen android phone should definitely go for this.. I dont play games so cant say much about how it is responding to games and all but otherwise ingards of basic works and reading pdfs on a large screen, this product is obviously a good choice.. had to come here and drop my comment to add to the positive no of the views by satisfied customers of Alcatel A3 10..",
            "Its massive screen does all the attracting. I've been using it for a while now and I must say its pretty great indeed.\nThe only thing to point out though is its default apps, especially the camera app. it's awful and you must change it.\nThe camera is not at all okay or upto standard but after you change the app it gets alot better indeed, front camera though not that great. but this is a budget device and its well and truly okay if you compare budget with the device.\n\nThe device is overall very steady and infact i got headphones and screen guard which was not written in the description section when I made the purchase. That was a nice surprise from alcatel indeed.\nBattery backup is great.\n\nAlthough, must point out. its touch screen doesn't create any issues but its a hard touch and not a more soft sensitive touch. you'd feel it.\n\nLove the device truly for home use. perfect for my mum.",
            "The tablet is as per the specs mentioned.\nPros - Very good battery life. 2 gb ram. 1 gb is almost always free when working. Latest android. Twin speakers are loud and clear.\nCons - touch not that smooth but responsive. Video quality is a bit lower. Does not give a feel of 720p. But good enough. Text while reading looks good too. Not that sharp as compared to mobile phones because of less pixel density.\nAt this price range its quite good. Got it at 7200 on big billion days.",

Yes the Tablet has been updated, and it now has VoLTE.\nOnly complaint is that a flash for the rear camera would have been nice, and Mediatek processor shows some lag in starting apps, plus the touch sometimes does not register at once.\nI got it to read downloaded PDF books as I am a teacher, plus occasionally browse, it serves that purpose very well.\nA movie and some videos plus normal browsing battery is down to 50% by the end of the day, So battery life is good, but pixelation is evident when watching movies and videos.",

            "*Simply Awesome*\n\nAfter 15 days usage I realized Tablet performance is Awesome .There is no tablet available in the market Wi Fi with 4G in this range..\n\n1.Battery Backup is good but taking 2 much time for charging approx 4 hours.\n\n2.Resolution should be more..\n\n3.camera is not good but according to range it's acceptable.\n\n4.Network Catching power is good but i hope I next series there should be 4G updated with VOLTE.\n\n5.& one the major problem of this tablet is that there is no port available for Pen Drive or Flash Drive..u can't able to connect keyboards or mouse.This is the major drawback of this tablet .Hope in future will be updated with this feature.\n\nWanna say one thing those who are students n need a device for study Go blindly with this tablet because there is no tablet available in the market with 10.1 inch.in this range..N screen size is very good able to read anything .\nSo guys don't worry Go blindly with this tab..It is just Simply Awesome....",
            "Negative feedback - Poor camera quality , poor screen resolution for videos, poor home icon clarity ( android 7 ), some time feels slow speed but OK,\nPositive feedback - Good battery backup , Enjoy with big screen size, fairly enough sound clarity, best view for high quality images , Best quality head phone, big size but handy weight, spend low for biggest screen.\nOverall my rating - 7/10.",
            "After Using 10 Days I Can Surely Say, This is The Best 10.1\" Tab in The Market in 9999 Rs. Althout It Doesnot Support Volty But it is Useful for The Study Purpose..I Want To Suggest This Tab For Those Who Like Big Display.",

            "Happy \ud83d\ude04 with it. Initially had the roux screen issue, but I think it's due to larger screen size. I got used to it within a few days. No lagging with touch responsiveness. One thing that's never usable are the cameras. Except that it's worth a lot more than what's paid.",
            "It's a good device for reading and light tasks....but it has its limits.....mediatek Mt 6735 b is ok on handling everyday tasks but still you can see a bit of ui lag but not much....though you won't Abel to play heavy games on it..... screen size is 10' but the resolution is too low for a 10incher you can see the pixels if look carefully......on the better side....very good for reading and multimedia oriented tasks speaker output is very good .....and forget the cameras they are rubbish but anyway who cares about tablet cameras anyway......only accelerometer sensor is present.....",
            "Best in 10 thousand but without hesitation it is best under its price display isn't that great but it looks amazing to hold just 9mm wow and some people in review saying it's heavy I don't think it's heavy it's a best choice under 10k",
            "Not very happy with performance.\nDoesn't feel like 2 gb ram yet good enough at this price (8.5k)\nRest is as good as needed.",
            "After using 1yr,I must say that It is a very good Tab in this price range! I have used other brands before but This one is pretty good,till now I have not faced any issue!!\n\nBut I also want to say,dont install too many apps as they drain battery quickly,i have only necessary aaps installed and it is running pretty smooth !!\n\nI am very Happy with Alcatel,keep up the good work!!",
            "Good Deal if you will buy it in 6000 rupees or less.\nA smarter device for any shop , outlet or home.\nPerformance is not good but average.",
            "I bought it for just Rs-6849. Obviously it's a great deal. After using it for some weeks I am happy enough. I bought it for reading and watching matches, movies. Display is good enough, I am really happy for the display quality. Rear Camera just ok but front camera is like VGA. It is not a gaming tablet, lags often. Good tablet for, internet surfing, watching videos, reading aslo support 4G and gives good speed",
            "This is great product from Alcatel and thanks to flipkart for providing this for just Rs .6299 . We are getting VOLTE 10 inch tablet with decent RAM and Display , pls dont compare the performance with a phone. If your requirement is casual entertainment like browsing, videos, pdfs this will be perfect.\n\nI solely bought for the purpose of reading PDF story books. The large display did not disappoint me.",
            "Bought it for 7k on independence day sale. Very good tablet. Camera is not so good though. Only 10.7 gb available for use. Battery backup is good. There is no green light signal while charging. Sound is good. All over it's pretty good tablet for 7k. Go for it.",
            "This value for money product i wouldn't say this the best tablet but its really good for normal use... And extremely good and value for money.",
            "I received the Tablet in very good condition. The packaging was really good and the delivery, prompt. The Tablet itself is beautiful, not too heavy, not too light and feels sturdy...it's not the fastest..I use it for watching movies and online shopping, it's perfect. Speakers volume is ok...(I guess it also depends on the quality of the movie). The display is good. Crisp and clear - like watching a mini flatscreen TV! I really recommend this if you are looking for a basic Tablet for movies, online shopping and social networking. As for Gaming like PubG, etc..it may prove to be a bit lag-y.. Overall it's a great budget tablet!",
            "Overall a good tab for entertainment purposes. Pros.- 1. Display is large so can be used for entertainment which is reason i brought after reading most of review written everywhere about the product. Just buy a supporting stand and enjoy conviniently. 2. Sound is loud enough but the quality is average. one can use headphones for better sound quality 3. Screen response is good to touch and display though average is enjoyble for the price range.. 4. Battery though less is sufficient. Cons.- Not much for the price range. 1. Camera is not so great. Hardly of any use. 2. Power management is not that great. 3. Dont think of playing any high end games. Judgement- if looking for entertainment puposes or using Hotstar/Netflix/ Youtube and any entertainment related apps, go for this tab.",
            "Good for watching videos and playing small games ,\ndo not expect best outcome for big games.\n\nWorthy for the price ...\nLooks good",
            "nice tab for d price. very good display n flawless performance so far though d look is bit cheep but from price point one can expect only this quality",
            "Really best for the price. Got it for Rs. 6000/-(2GB+16GB with sim). Very huge display... Good for watching movies... Battery lasts for 6 hours during movies. Standby time more than 4 days when unused. Good to read e books.. Movies... And to show presentations on big screen",
            "I got it for just Rs. 5,849 in big shopping days.\n\nPros\n\n1. The display is so big you literally feel like you are carrying a portable TV in your hand. Perfectly suited for watching videos online.\n\n2. The sound is also decently loud you no need a separate Bluetooth speaker.\n\n3. They come with one charger, usb cable for charging, earphones and a tempered glass.\n\n4. Awesome value for money if you buy at the price I have bought, in fact I gave 4 stars mainly because of the price I have bought.\n\nCons\n\n1. Performance is very very dull. I have only a decent amount of apps and have never played games in this tab so far (bought less than a month ago and not used much), but still it gets stuck now and then. I am so scared to install any more apps as I feel it will perform even worse.\n\nConclusion\n\nIf you are mainly going to use it for watching videos and you are buying at discounted price (not worth more than 6000) like me then you can very well go ahead and buy it.",

But tab is too good for this price with this budget.\n\nNow i am writing this review after using it for 3 months. The performance is good. There is slight delay. Battery life is good. Without much usage, it can withstand 1 week. with continuous usage it can stand for more than 5-6 hours. Display is too good.",

When formatted as internal storage or external storage after some time the memory card getting unresponsive . 8 GB is working fine. Didn't tried 16 GB.\n2. We cannot use a OTG pen drive and headset together as the plugs for these two are really close enough. So you cannot watch a movie with headset directly from your pen drive.\n3. Charging is very slow with a provided charger\n4. Games like PUBG is taking too much time to load and very slow too\n5. Android version is 7, not able to update to latest\n6. some essential apps like LinkedIn is not supported",

            "Good for general web browsing,E book reading.Bought it for Rs 6300.\nIf you are planning to buy it for the original price of Rs 9999, then it not worth it.\nThe processor is just sufficient to play low to medium quality 720p videos and stutters for any thing higher.\nThe network and WiFi reception is excellent.\nScreen viewing angle and dual front speakers are excellent.Although the sound output from both the speakers is not same.The back of the tab vibrates when sound is playing.\nThe screen brightness is just sufficient for indoors.Battery life is average.\nIt takes 3.5 to 4 hours to charge fully.\nThe on board camera is only good for video calling in good lighting conditions and is below average.",

But it's same as Honor tab, Lenovo Tab which costs Rs 15K approx.\nPrice I purchased : Rs 6,199 with Bank offer.\nSound : speaker sounds very very good.\n\nCons.\nDevice is little bit slow.",
            "I got it for 6999rs on the big sale day. For the price that I got it for, it is the best in class. Yes, the display is not FHD and there will be haziness when playing 720p HD videos as well. But, for the price, it is amazing. Plus, it is WiFi+4G. Could not have asked for more. If display is a concern for you, go for the Alcatel Pop 4 and it also has a Snapdragon 430 as the processor.\nThe camera on this device is not at all good and that is obvious. Tabs were never meant to be for clicking photographs. But, for reading, surfing the internet and watching videos, this is the best tab you can possibly get. It is amazing and I'm very happy with my purchase. Will highly recommend it to all.",

            "One of the best tabs of recent times. A super huge display size of 10 inch. You can watch movies, web series, done a lot surfing with at ease. Camera is downside, though 5 mp rear camera serves its purpose in daylight, with okay 2 mp selfie camera for video calling purpose. Battery life is awesome.!! A big thumbs up. Screen is a hd one and colour production is smooth, and sharp. Not a gaming tab, but small games performs well. Almost stock android (7.1) helps a smooth experience overall. A minor lag occurs but that is fine. A must buy..",

            "To be very honest, I thought I have made a huge mistake by ordering this product at first.. but after using it for two weeks, I'd like to give this product a 7.3/10. I've previously used IBall tablets, and I'd recommend this as a best budget tablet. I got it for 8K on Independence day Sale. Coming to the product, Probably the first thing that you've to do is to update your Google Play Store & Google Play Service Apps otherwise you won't be able to use it! I was ready to offload this product only for this reason and then, By doing some research around the web, I've found out just the way to counter this issue!\nAnd since then, It's just perfect!\nYou should not expect a very catchy buildup, But it's just enough to justify its price tag.\nBattery backup is quite good.\nNot much heating issues till now.\nNot experienced any such lags while Multitasking.\nSound Quality is excellent.\nCameras are not up to the mark.... I hope Alcatel will do something to it in near future.\nContrast ratio is superb!\nDon't think it is wise to play high-performance games.\nNo HDMI Port is an issue.\n\nIf you're looking for a pocket-friendly, home use tablet, I'd definitely recommend this!",
            "Really nice budget tablet using it for long time what I like is the picture quality. The camera is though 5 MP but the pictures it take is of awesome quality. This tab have multi tasking and found in excellent. My family loves it. The only cons I observed that it works slow for youtube on wi-fi rest every thing is perfect.",
            "A very good product in this budget. It suffice my need for epaper and books reading. Also good for watching movies and videos. Just it lags in HD videos on YouTube. But you can view those in lesser resolutions and it works fine. It also has good battery backup.",
            "certainly it is the best tablet available in market in this price range... big screen and crystal clear display.. supports 4g and by using jio app u can use calling too.. good for watching photos videos and for doing study online... camera is not that good though it makes laptop slow still good for video calling... u can play many games on it but it's big so u will not like to play asphalt or any other racing game as I won't move this tab like a car steering... else it's superb it will give u the true fun of browsing and using fb and other social app... it supports OTG.. box contains screen guard... very thin.. u can insert a memory card and it will give u feeling of an AppLe iPad... enjoy guys...",

            "Wonderful experience so far. Purpose behind purchasing this tab is to read ebooks in pdf format. I was just looking for big screen and to avoid stress on eyes with mobile screen. My use strictly restricted to reading only. Screen size is huge and helpful for the purpose I bought it. Battery backup is awesome. While reading in Adobe reader android app screen remains stable without any light deem. 3 to 4 days battery is sufficient enough. And ofcourse little bit of surfing and reding online news papers.\n\nThis review may not be helpful for you if looking for games and watching videos.",
            "Great features. Affordable price. Good configuration 4g network 2gb ram good processor as compared to price",
            "It's specs are better than the only wifi version. I used it only through wifi and it is good for watching videos and reading pdf files thats what i used for. It does struggle in multi window mode or if there are too many taps on chrome. But there is a new version out there so may be it is better than this.",
            "it is a must buy tab specially if you like watching movies on Netflix.. the screen quality is superb when it plays HD movies.. and the sound is also loud..\nit is smooth in performance.. it has night read option so u can read e books on it... battery strength is too good can go for weeks on one full charge... in short it is worth the money..",

            "Pros: Great for students, big screen size , works seamlessly, good battery life.\nCons: don't expect very great display at this price, if you look very closely you can spot pixels (although i heard this is common in tablets), don't buy this if you want high performance and expecting to play heavy games in it.\n\nI am giving it 5 stars as it stands up to my expectations and requirements as a student.\n\nShould you go for it? See, it's a chinese product and not a very reputed brand. So, I am not sure about it's durability. If you get it under 8000 as I got in offer, then you may consider it.",
            "Using since few months with Jio card and this tablet is really delight to watch video and u tube. With negligible lag and even though it is not HD, the screen quality is impressive and does not allow to feel lack of HD while watching movies, with sound is superb from dual speakers. With price tag below Rs 10000 ( I got under offers @ Rs 8500) and 10 inch size there is no competition, simply worth of all the price. High end gaming is not tried.

            "Good product at this affordable price. Nice in all the aspects except camera. If you are not worried about the camera then I suggest you to go for this tab. Very useful for reading and studying purposes. Using it since 1 month so no issues. Has very good battery backup. And it takes 4 hours to charge it fully.\nSo finally I recommend you to purchase this product it you budget is up to 10K. And it's worth the money for this 10\"tab.\nThanks you Alcatel for bringing this affordable tab in the Indian market. And I hope it will not have any issues in the future.",
            "very good product in this budget & good for basic works like wordpad, web browsing like so...",
            "It's a 10,000 tab.I bought it for 9000 during women\"s day offer. I never play games and I am a basic user of tablet. I am reviewing after 1 week usage\n\nPositives:\n*Huge advantage is big display and you can not get more than this. Even though you get it, it may not be comfortable to handle.\n*Good speakers\n*Battery back up is good\n*Memory is good (Installed all basic apps like whatsapp,fb )\n*Android touch is good and quick\n\nNegatives:\n\n*Weight is somewhat bulky. It's ok if we sit and use. If we lay on bed and use then it feels heavy\n*Little bit of noise during high volume\n*Display clarity is not too great.\n* RIP Camera\nAs an average user like me (I use it mainly for browsing, watching you tube videos, whatsapp etc ), this tab is pitch perfect.\n. After all ,this tablet is only below 10k. So it deserves 4 star . Would have given 5 stars had the tablet been less bulky. The negatives mentioned here are not very big drawbacks and can be ignored.\n\nGo for it for optimum use. You cannot find any other tab under 10k with these features .",
            "One of the best tab in the market.\nSome pros are:\n1) large screen\n2)dual speaker\n3) 4000mah battery\n4)4g volte enable\n5) otg supportable.\nFew cons are:\n1) low internal storage\n2)only 2gb ram provided\n3) camera quality not so good\nIn comparison to pros, cons are little affected. After all, this is a good tab within 10k. Recommended for everyone. Worthy of buying.",
            "The tab is a work of ingenuity. I had this tab for over a month. Answers to FAQs are below in form of pros and cons.\n\nPros:-\n1. Affordable 10.1\" tablet\n2. A very crisp and sharp display\n3. Clear sound\n4. Slim design, easy to hold, easy to operate\n5. 4g volte works fine\n6. The processor even though not that of a premium tablet, churns out enough performance.\n7. Responsive\n8. Standby time is impressive\n9. Stock android (P.S i installed Google now launcher and now it's a totally authentic Google Android tablet)\n\nCons:-\n1. Doesn't support 720p display and will start lagging.\n2. You may feel the audio starts to crackle at high volume.\n3. No extra port for USB and pendrives.\n4. Front camera is not alligned very well and you may have to adjust it to take a selfie.\n5. Universal cover available but no model specific cover which is a let down.\n6. Plastic finish may turn off some buyers\n\nVerdict:-\nThis tablet may not be at par with the other tablets but ranks very close. However, don't confuse it as a high performance tablet for gaming and all those activities. It's a perfect hand-held device for watching movies, reading ebooks and research papers and with volte+4g connectivity, the device would keep you satisfied.",
            "Best budget Tablet ever. Get charged faster & consume battery faster. Work best with oo launcher.",

            "Have been using it for nearly 6 months now. Very much satisfied with the product. Does everything promised very well. Very good value for money. Doesn't have any of the problems that cheap phones or tabs have. Biggest advantage is the huge display screen which changes the user experience. This product has no competition and is in a class of it's own. I recommend it. It is well built and robust. Awesome battery life too.",
            "following options are NOT available,\n\n1) screen mirroring option is NOT there\n2) NO fast charging facility\n3) Takes 5 hours for full charge (0 - 100%) every day\n4) Battery lasts for only one day\n5) multi window stucks when any one window is screening YouTube.\n6) at a time only one excel file we can keep open\n7) it could have been very good if there would have been TAB, CTRL, ALT & ARROW keys...\n8) Touch sensitivity is Not good... Most of the time, need to touch multiple times instead of single.\n9) Tempered glass suitable for this tab is NO WHERE available (the one on flipkart too is either smaller than screen or covering the speakers (drastically reduces volume if speakers are covered)",

I have gifted this one to my father who reads a lot and very active on social media. He is simply loving it.\nThe video playback as well as sound is also up to the marks.\nI recommend everyone to go for it.",

            "This piece of technology has worked up to be an amazing device for work and play. My media consumption has completely been shifted from my mobile to the tab. Overall pretty damn impressed by what Alcatel has managed to pack in this 10 inch device. Hope the initial impressions last upto its lifetime! Don't expect to be blazing fast though. The processor is pretty weak and can only manage 1 or 2 apps at a time. A good media Consumption tool. Nothing more!",
            "Nice product for tab users, good work, nice display, good for presentation, nice volume. Overall all ok in low rate.",

            "I would give 3 star. This tablet does pretty good job. Sound is really good and loud. Only problems it gets hanged a lot and touch screen sensitibity is pretty much low. Camera quality is oka, video recording not good.\nBut its a good buy in this budget in terms of screen size. Rest portion is 3 out of 5.",
            "I'm using from 1 month. Best product in budget. Handle with care type of product because very thin body and small processor with large screen. Battery backup also long lasting. Best featured tab with Reasonable cost.",

            "Just loved this tablet. Latest OS & good specs. Good battery that last long. Above all, it's light to hold on your hands and carry around. Brightness and sound are also very good. My perfect companion. I do reading, internet browsing, video viewing with satisfaction. Thanks Alcatel for a good and affordable Tablet.",
            "Good product for 9999 rupees.\nScreen size and clarity good,\nSound good,\nGaming and accessing video files, photos seems to be little slower.\nBut good for average day to day use..",
            "Positives ==\nThe product is good and meets expectation of a Tablet.\nWhen there are tablets costing more than Rs.20000, this I got for just Rs.10000, so I dont expect much and this serves me the purpose of tablet which I can give to my kids without much worry about the amount I invest.\n\nNegatives ==\nThe screen pixel clarity is not that good, most of the images get blur pixel effect when you see in a bigger screen like this.\nPlastic body - might break easily\nSound clarity is good but not excellent when the volume is on full raise.",
            "Good tablet with big screen. However the touch sensitivity of the screen is not good across the screen. As of now not used its calling facility by inserting the SIM card. Using it as ebook reader. The battery backup is good. No overload of apps. Screen refresh rate is slow.",
            "I bought this tab recently and using it extensively. 10 inches is too big to carry but gives very good experience while watching movies or playing games. Almost no lags while playing big games like asphalt 8. I use it purely for entertainment and is definitely not a replacement for phone. Hard to carry everywhere. One more thing is it doesn't have the earpiece so you need to attach earphone for making or receiving calls. Speakers are loud. Sometimes touch is not that responsive but that is fine with me as you can't expect that from the tab in this price range. I would recommend it.",
            "This is the best you can get at this price point. 800 pixels wide screens is just good enough for 10.1 inch form factor.",
            "nice product big screen good battry life good sound but camra quality is not good",
            "Very good. Go for it. At this price point and the specs, currently zero competition. Quality seems to be good too. Fabulous sound & big display. For first time tab users & for gifting for parents this is a perfect fit.",

            "Alcatel A3 10.1 tab is a gem in budget and mid range segment, multimedia and browsing experience on this 10 in tab is quite different over 7 or 8 in tabs. Processor and UI used are surprisingly entertaining me battery life is above normal chaging once in a day is enough for me I must thank Flipcart for marketing this tab I have purchased more than a dozen tabs and mobiles from Flipcart in the past couple of years All of them are still functioning very well with me and my family members My next wish is to purchase bezelless Mi Mix2 from Flipcart for around 15k when price drops atleast after a year or so and I will wait, I am not a gamer.",
            "Surprisingly this tab works smooth on all aspects. Performance, as phone, double Speakers are good, Battery back up is also decent. Camera is not very good but one can manage decent video calling and normal quality snaps. You can play asphalt 8, guns of booms effortlessly on this tab. Screen brightness is good and viewing angles are nice. In aeroplane mode you can not use wifi. Auto screen brightness is not there, as light sensor is not present.",
            "Terrific value for money. Bought 2 units during the BBD in September.\nRemember it's just a. HD display, but a great display.\nVery good speakers with good volume.. Even at 50% volume also it's high.\nGood battery life,.\nExtremely good for older people as fonts are quite big and can be made bigger.\nOf course don't expect anything from the Cameras as expected from the tab.\nHowever picture transmission is very good if you are skyping.\nGood for day to day use and browsing.\nHave not loaded the games so can't comment on performance..\nNot many bloatware and that's an advantage.",
            "The best budget tab in market now with almost all features like 4G, WiFi & Voice call with single Nano-Piezoelectric sim. Screen display is not that great as it's only HD and not Full HD display. No particular case cover available for this tab model in market. Plastic screen guard is provided in box. Basic ear phones provided in box. OS Update is available once you start the tab for first time.",
            "Great Tab according to the price range. More than good for watching videos and studying purposes.\n\nBuild Quality is not that great , but at the price range you cant expect too much.\n\nBattery back up is very reliable when used with Wi-Fi. ( Haven't used with Sim Card).",

            "Got this for 7,200/- on Diwali sale, so far good. If you are purchasing for kids be careful, since the build quality not so good. The main challenge is get the accessories, you have to adjust with universal 10 inch cover. I went for Micromax Funbook Pro 10 inch cover because of build quality (personally don't recommend it, since camera closed both sides completely and not fit properly). Alcatel please release accessories asap.\n\nOverall reasonable purchase at this price",

Didn't find any lag.\nThe USP would be the display size. For such less price we get to see things in big screen.\nDo not consider camera as a feature for this tab as the one it has is useful for nothing.

            "Alcatel 10.1 inch TABLET was delivered to me on 3 rd october 2017 , i purchased it because it has WI FI and 4G fecility.I took it to JIO MOBILE OFFICE FOR 4G SIM AND PURCHASED, when i asked them to put the sim into the TABLET, they found the TRAY AND THE PIN SLOT IS DAMAGED AND NOT WORKING WITH A SMALL PIECE SNAPPED AND CAME . THey showed me without inserting the SIM and asked me to approach the FLIPKART or the local authorised service center for rectification or Change of TRAY WITH PROPER FECILITY TO INSERT THE SIM CARD. Accordingly i handed over to the local service center. But he says the TRAY is fixed along with the MOTHER BOARD and the entire mother board is to be changed!

            "Nice Product.. felt bigger than 10 inch.. Nice battery back up.I guess you can watch 4 movies continuosly.. nice loud speaker the draw back is headphone volume and OTG connection is which is very next to ear phone connector. At a time you can't OTG n insert ear phone as both are so close either one will be damaged.. Alcatel should work on this. charging need to keep it for hours that's the only drawbacks. almost 6 hours charging for 100%",

As of now, it is working fine and no complaints for normal day-day usage like browsing, reading books, watching movies, etc... I don't use the tablet for camera and voice calling. So, I am fine with whatever it's offered. I can get the internet using JIO sim. It supports VoLTE for voice calling as well. I did not notice any issue with WIFI and mobile signals and seems to me fine. The only problem that i have is to find the accessories like back case, screen guard for this tablet. Company should offer the accessories either bundled with the product with additional cost or sell it separately to buy it. Back panel of the tablet is cheap plastic and should be guarded with back case. Otherwise, it could break if we drop it. Overall, I am happy with the purchase.",

It is giving a decent battery back up, but after 50% it is directly jumping to 0% and getting switched off. While charging also after 50-55% it is directly jumping to 100%. I think it is a software issue. Alcatel please fix it!",

Guys go for it it worth buying u will start forgetting your laptop if u buy alcatel a3 10\"",
            "The screen quality is average and touch is also not that responsive sometimes. Speakers are decent. It takes approx 5 hours to charge from 0-100. Battery life is really poor as it drains out very fast, would be great if alcatel can fix it with some OTA update, but personally I think the chances of this tablet getting an OTA update is unlikely. Wifi adapter/receiver in this device is pretty strong, standing at same spot and being connected to the same network I get full or fair strength on this device as compared to other devices (redmi 4, moto g2, laptop) on which I get weak or poor strength. Camera quality is not great, anyways tablets aren't meant for camera usage. UI feels almost stock android with some alcatel apps and flipkart app preloaded. I haven't faced any UI lags till now, UI works smoothly. The tablets is a good purchase for general usage and for people who are comfortable with large screen size.

I notice that many times if battery is less than 20 percent it starts discharging very fastly like within 2 minutes it will consume the whole 20 percent and switches off. And another thing is very slow charging, it takes like 4 hours to charge the whole battery from 0 to 100 without using it and it wont even charge much if we are using it. I thought of applying for a refund but there is no option at all and when i applied for replacement they rejected it twice. If you want to buy a tablet i suggest you to buy branded ones like samsung etc and not to go with cheap ones like this which have a lot of problems and there will be no solution.

Thus attracting scratches and marks on the screen very easily.. In a panic mode I ordered Screen Guard from a different website at a high cost.\n\nThere are no covers or OTG cable given along with this Tablet.. Cost Cutting ?

I was thinking of returning the tablet, but the tab has improved in its response, and it seems to be okay now... However, don't expect response speed of a mobile from this tablet.\n\nOn a positive note, I got this tab for Rs.7,199/- on Billion day Sale, so it seems okay with this price as it is a 4G tab albeit only with a single SIM .
