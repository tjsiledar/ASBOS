Can not say much now.\n\nFor Flipkart : Amazed by Flipkart service. I got the product delivered exactly in 15 hrs. Very prompt follow up by deliver person and smoothly delivered.",
            "\"How I Stopped Worrying and Learned to Love Lenovo Yoga Tab 3.\"\n\nLook, it's a decent product and it gets the job done.\nYouTube App won't play 1080p videos since it has a resolution of 1280x720.\nSame story goes with a full HD movie.\nBattery is great.\nSpeakers are decent.\nCamera is okay-ish.\nHotspot acts erratically, good luck connecting other devices in first attempt.\nNo calling facility.\nIf I were you, I'd go for Lenovo Tab 4. I couldn't because they don't accept returns. Which led to quite a tiresome conversation. It was like banging my head against a wall. And after an hour of banging I kinda felt dizzy. So this is How I Stopped Worrying and Learned to Love Lenovo Yoga Tab 3.\nKeep in mind, THIS PRODUCT HAS A 10 DAYS REPLACEMENT POLICY, NOT RETURN POLICY. Lenovo Tab 4 would cost you \u20b97000 more but at least, it won't be losing its relevancy anytime soon.\nIt'd have been perfect if it came along with 1080p display and 3GB RAM.\nThis tablet is on the verge of becoming a dinosaur. Which one? I don't know. Let's just say T-Rex. Remember those fellas with tiny arms? Yeah! At least they were faster than this tablet.\nNevertheless, stand feature is great.\nIt's heavy, so it's not for people with flimsy hands. You're very likely to get tired easily while holding it in one hand.\nAll in all, don't throw much at it and it'll just get by.\nP.S. If you want to make calls with this tablet, just download Jio4GVoice App. If Play Store says that the App isn't compatible with your device, then simply download it in your phone and send it do your tablet via SHAREit/Xender etc. Install it manually and enjoy calling features. Use same procedure with MyJio App for Data Consumption Monitoring and to avail other features.",
            "Using from last 5 months. I must say it is perfect for me. My main purpose is to use for study purposes. I use pencil for notes making and most importantly underlined, highlights.\nIt is having super super awesome battery full day runs with wifi on.\nMust go if you looking for study purposes.",

If u want to watch movies or you want to do youtubing, read articles, magazines, want to try some tutorials then its awesome and that kind of stuff then its the best tab in this range. I am very impressed with the speakers and touch of tab.\n\nGraphics are fine, internal memory is 16GB and it has 2 GB RAM, Android is Marshmallow (6.0.1) and one more thing, it does not support WhatsApp or bank app, some apps like ALT Balaji, Episode, etc. I tried but failed.\n\nAll the modes of this Yoga Tab are helpful. You want to study, you want to play they just help. There is no call facility in this tablet. It is just a tab which can be connected to internet via wifi or 4g-3g internet packs. Battery life is good. Charger cable is very very small. you cannot use tab while charging. Camera is also not that good. but its fine for this price 10 inch tab. There is no headphones in the box. I was expecting headphones but didn't get one.\n\nJust put a screen guard and add a memory card to use it for long purpose. There will be difficulty in finding a screen guard and case/cover for this tablet. I am facing in finding a case/cover.\n\nDelivery was one day prior. Packing was not that good. They just packed it. It was not bubble wrapped or any other safety precaution was not taken by Flipkart to protect device. At lest they should have bubble wrapped it.",
            "The YT3-X50L is a great product - good resolution, clean UI and the usual stuff you would expect from Lenovo build and Android OS.\n\nThe problem is that this has no meaningful support for multi-users. Marshmallow 6.0 on my Lenovo Vibe smartphone works fine. But on this tablet, (which auto-upgraded to 6.0.1 when I set it up) has unusable multi-user support.\n\nYou have to go to Settings and search for \"User\" - there's no menu item directly available. Once you have setup a new user/restricted profile you cannot select this user in the login screen - there's no user icon in the top-right corner of the screen. So in effect, to switch users, you have to get past the lock screen, go to Settings, search for user and choose the user you wish to switch to.\n\nVery clunky user experience.\n\nContacted Lenovo support, but I might as well have asked a politician when he is going to fulfil his election promise. Got motherhood suggestions and when I asked specific questions, was asked to go to Lenovo Care Center. Which I am unable to find from their website in my vicinity.",

But on this tablet, (which auto-upgraded to 6.0.1 when I set it up) has unusable multi-user support.\n\nYou have to go to Settings and search for \"User\" - there's no menu item directly available. Once you have setup a new user/restricted profile you cannot select this user in the login screen - there's no user icon in the top-right corner of the screen. So in effect, to switch users, you have to get past the lock screen, go to Settings, search for user and choose the user you wish to switch to.\n\nVery clunky user experience.\n\nContacted Lenovo support, but I might as well have asked a politician when he is going to fulfil his election promise. Got motherhood suggestions and when I asked specific questions, was asked to go to Lenovo Care Center. Which I am unable to find from their website in my vicinity.",
