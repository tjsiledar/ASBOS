            "Overall, it is a good product but considering the price, is it value for money, you decide yourself: My rating depicts my view\nPros:\nGorgeous screen but too oversaturated that strains eyes significantly over a long a period of time.\nSolid and very pretty design\nCalling tablet hence all mobile app (whatsapps, mobile banking,shopping etc.) are installable. No discrimination by APPS\nControlled heating but that controls performance as well.\n\nCons:\n- Insufficient RAM or poor RAM management, out of 2.7 GB (real RAM) only 1.6 GB was available on first boot and after installing 20 odd apps, free RAM almost never crosses 1.4 GB mark. If you are power consumer i.e. twitter, facebook, email, whatsapp then dont expect to have more than 1.1 GB RAM free.\n- Lots of bloatware like normal GOOGLE APPS plus samsung's own apps plus plus microsoft app like skype, ms office etc. Come on samsung I paid for the 32 GB storage,, allow me to decide what I want in that storage.\n- Average or below average battery backup. 5970 MAH battery for 9.7 inch screen is a JOKE. If you want more battery then use all black themes like wallpaper, browser background,, twitter theme, facebook theme etc. But if I have to use BLACK for battery purposes what the the is need for GORGEOUSNESS of AMOLED screen. Come on sammy increase the thickness by .5 mm but give me at least 7000 MAH buddy.\n- Charging from 0 to 100% is a nightmare (anything between 3.5 to 4.5 hours).. Dont kid me sammy. Why not fast charging in a tablet of 40k.\n- Somewhat average gaming performance. I could face quite lot of lag while playing NOVA, NEED FOR SPEED etc.\n- Average camera performance. Front camera is useless if you are looking for a high definition SKYPE or VIDEO CALL. Rear camera is good for day lighting. Under room lighting it is not even worth using. Why not a SINGLE LED flash sammy like on NEXUS9.\n- Slows down significantly over a period of time. I did try to optimise by disabling almost all bloatwares, disabling screen effects and screen animations yet after 3 months or so, its performance lagged quite significantly. May be due to their POOR exynos chipset...\n- Finger print scanner is not an active but passive one which means, you have to press the front home button to wake up and then only you can use the FINGER PRINT to unlock the device unlike many phones which unlock the device straightaway.\n- No BLUE LIGHT filter. Display mode does have READING MODE but that reading mode is not actually a reading mode. Reading mode enhances the color reproduction quite significantly which strains the eyes, further, though the screen colors do get little warm by this reading mode but BLUE LIGHT is still very significant so as to disturb your sleep.\nThink before spending almost 40k.",
            "Delivered in time, good excellent instrument, battery also ok. Nice clarity over all its pretty good",
            "Great purchase. Amazing display. Super sleek. Battery lasts one day or 5 hours straight, depending on your use. Comes with Andoird 7.0. Fast performance across the board. Loved it.",
            "Even after 3 years of launch, this product is still awesome due to its screen, weight and thinness. Hard core gamers, beware. The battery life is just average, not your regular Samsung tablet battery life. But the whole experience you get by using this device is still awesome. There is nothing thinner and lighter than this in the market. Its coming with nougat out of the box along with Samsung's own TouchWiz ui which, though, is 2 generations behind the current android pie, but it never feels like an old device. I use it mainly for browsing, reading and document editing and this 4:3 aspect ratio is just the right thing for it. And this particular model is 819 which was released in 2016 with a Snapdragon SoC.",
            "I bought this tablet as an ebook reader to read PDFs of study hooks and comics books. The light weight and excellent screen make it a perfect reader. It's also excellent for web surfing. Websites feel like magazines now. The AMOLED screen, when used with a dark background puts very little stress on the eye. The processor is a Snapdragon 652, which is more than adequate for everyday tasks. I can't talk about gaming as I don't game on it. The processor being Snapdragon means that this tablet has LineageOS support. I recently installed LineageOS 16, and now I have Android 9.0 with latest security patches. I also get monthly Android updates. Android 9.0 runs silky smooth on this tablet. It's soo responsive and zippy. Battery life has improved too. I get more than 10 hours of screen time easily. The only con of this tablet is lack of fast charging and proper stylus support. I have an iPad too, which I bought for the same purpose originally. But it turned out to be a useless piece of junk and waste of my hard earned money. A simple task like transferring PDFs to the tablet and reading it with an app is such a pain on the iPad. In Android it's just copy-paste-read. This Samsung beats my iPad in every way, it has a much better screen, Microsd card support, faster processor, lighter weight, more RAM, costs half as much AND IT GETS THE JOB DONE without getting in your way. Overall a highly recommend tablet.",
