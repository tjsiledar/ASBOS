            "At a budget of Rs. 8K this is the only tab with Oreo running right now. The LCD is quite bright with good contrast and colours and the sound quality is also commendable but the output level is a bit low. Being VoLTE enabled, it runs on Jio SIM flawlessly. Overall I found this better than Samsung or iBall Tabs in this range and lag is also less as compared to the others. Don't expect blazing fast performance on this but the processor does it's job well. One thing is to be noted that Youtube runs at max 720p on this tab, no FullHD....",

            "Battery backup is not bad at all, camera is just like VGA of old time below average , a little sluggish performance but overall it's quite impressive and currently there is no better than this in this price range, I will recommend everyone to purchase this for web surfing,pdf reading and video streaming though display is not that much impressive but it is sharp and feels good to eye.",
