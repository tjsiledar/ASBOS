            "Review after roughly 2 months of usage.\nAlso, I did buy the keyboard separately. Didn't buy the Pen.\n\nSo, I'll first address what my needs were and then tell you what Pros and Cons did this device had for me.\n\nThe kind of work I needed to do -\n- Run online IDEs(Integrated development Environment) for programming languages such as Java and Python.\n- Occasionally watch movies/shows etc.\n- I wanted more of a productivity device than an entertainment device.\n\nAnd that was it, I needed a device that could do this and be reliable. The problem with me was that I was on a very tight budget and just because I had to run online IDEs, I needed some more horsepower in a device, however, you can't get everything you want when you're on a tight budget and therefore I went on buying this product.\n\nPros -\n- Lightweight, you won't feel that this is in your backpack.\n- Beautiful display.\n- Best 2-in-1 device for Productivity.\n- You're gonna love the kickstand.\n- Premium design and materials used.\n\nCons -\n- Processing power is less.\n- Less RAM, should've atleast had 8GB of RAM. I would've paid extra if I could have gotten the exact same configuration with just 8GB RAM.\n- The device lags when I open more than 3 tabs on Google Chrome and because of the work I do, it always happen which can be sometimes frustrating but then you adjust with time.\n- Also, you can't add more RAM in this device.\n\n\nSo, if I could go back in time and buy the other costlier version of this device?\nThe answer is NO. The cost difference between this version and the other one is too much.\n\nIf there was a version which had the same configuration but more RAM and was maybe, at max, 4k costlier, then would I buy that?\nThe answer is YES. A big YES.\n\nWhy didn't I consider iPad?\nIt was \"cost vs needs\" for me. iPad is a premium product which I would've considered if I were buying this product for entertainment purposes but I needed more productivity and that's why this filled in my needs in a much better way. Think of this product as a laptop and not a tablet. iPad's are much better than the Surface Go if you're looking for a tablet. If you're looking for a miniature laptop then this is the one.\n\nPS - Frankly, I use OnePlus 7T Pro, which I think is definitely much more powerful and snappier than this but my phone still can't give me what this product is giving me for a much lesser price.\n\nPPS - Also, this is my first actual review, I wrote this so that people like me can make an educated guess because I never found someone like me who was in the market with the same needs.\n\nThank you for reading. Have a good day.\nCheers!",

            "Before buying this product ( I bought 8 GB Ram and 128 GB SSD), I have seen many reviews and some were very good, good and some was not good. But after using this I must say this is awesome. This might not be treated as a primary laptop for you, but if you are looking for something on the go, which is not so heavy and can be carried anywhere - believe me, go for it without any 2nd thought. I have at home, Dell all in one desktop and I was always looking for something, where I can use effectively on the go and this is the Tablet/Laptop ( whatever you say) for me. I am very happy using it.\n\nSo, if anyone, looking for:\n\n1. A secondary laptop/tablet - which can be used as laptop or tablet as per the need.\n2. A device with premier look.\n\nThis is for you and go for it guys..",
            "I am happy to buy it. I have been working with it one month ago. And its working perfectly.. Microsoft product always awesome...There is no doubt about it. But I have little issue with it, that screen could be wider than 9inchs. Other wise this surface is awesome..whenever you work with it or just hold it, feel like something you have which you can't elaborate by words\ud83d\ude0a",
            "I travel a lot and I own a Surface book 2 15\". therefore I wanted a smaller cheaper and lighter device for my short travels. I tried an IPad which is a wonderful yet restrictive tablet. the Go was in my sights for a while. I was considering getting the 8gb ram and 128 GB SSD but then saw some reviews about the 4gb 64 emmc and thought that it will be a secondary device so no need for it to spend extra cash and I am glad that I bought it. So far it has exceeded my expectations. it's really zippy . the emmc storage, though slower at read speed than the ssd is faster than a traditional HDD and windows 10 is good at storage and memory management so no worries there. I popped in a micro sd card for additional storage and got a type c connector dock for my external pereferals. the build quality is fantastic and even the basic optional type keyboard is superb is a must to get the most out of it. I highly recommend this device to anyone looking for a quality portable computer . In case you want this as a primary device and want to install more traditional apps then I recommend upgrading to the 8gb ram 128 ssd as you will get more of everything in the long run but if this is a secondary device or you don't use much then like me save some money and get this without second thought.",
            "Perfect ipad killer.. perfect combo of tablet and pc. I have purchased the 4gb model. Decent performance and the hats off to microsoft for designing such a quality product. Battery life is good. Its super light , has just enough power to sail through basic tasks and the kick stand improves the flexibility.\nIts is slightly over priced because the type cover comes as an add on. Just wait a little more till the price of type cover comes down and you ll be fine.\nDo not forget that the windows 10 offers the users plenty of freedom if u compare it to the ipad.",
            "Loved the product Microsoft has nailed it , device is too good easy to carry , it is pro device for student developer yes I run visual studio , visual studio code with good performance, it can run entire windows smooth and heavy workload capable device",
            "it's been few days but it's working is good. As a student, it serves well to me as don't require heavy software. just browse net make my doc's on word, power, excel and one-note. so yes good for students. the keyboard specially is good so buy it, go ahead.",
            "The processor is not so fast. But it gets my work done. I use it for around 12 hours everyday. I mostly use it for typing and watching videos. I didn't find any lag or shutdowns. There is no perceivable heat buildup. After 2weeks.. I have no complaints. It is very much upto my mark. I haven't downloaded any games or used it for that purpose. Mostly Microsoft Office and stuff. The battery life though.. Is not as advertised. I get around 4 hours maximum. But the keyboard I got was very good deal. Quite fast and responsive",
            "Great product, I love this product\nIt's more useful for common people & students\nBetter than Android tablets because it's windows 10 flatform\nMulti tasking very well,\n\nMicrosoft makes good move.",

I am very happy using it.\n\nSo, if anyone, looking for:\n\n1. A secondary laptop/tablet - which can be used as laptop or tablet as per the need.\n2. A device with premier look.\n\nThis is for you and go for it guys..",
            "I am happy to buy it. I have been working with it one month ago. And its working perfectly.. Microsoft product always awesome...There is no doubt about it. But I have little issue with it, that screen could be wider than 9inchs. Other wise this surface is awesome..whenever you work with it or just hold it, feel like something you have which you can't elaborate by words\ud83d\ude0a",
            "I travel a lot and I own a Surface book 2 15\". therefore I wanted a smaller cheaper and lighter device for my short travels. I tried an IPad which is a wonderful yet restrictive tablet. the Go was in my sights for a while. I was considering getting the 8gb ram and 128 GB SSD but then saw some reviews about the 4gb 64 emmc and thought that it will be a secondary device so no need for it to spend extra cash and I am glad that I bought it. So far it has exceeded my expectations. it's really zippy . the emmc storage, though slower at read speed than the ssd is faster than a traditional HDD and windows 10 is good at storage and memory management so no worries there. I popped in a micro sd card for additional storage and got a type c connector dock for my external pereferals. the build quality is fantastic and even the basic optional type keyboard is superb is a must to get the most out of it. I highly recommend this device to anyone looking for a quality portable computer . In case you want this as a primary device and want to install more traditional apps then I recommend upgrading to the 8gb ram 128 ssd as you will get more of everything in the long run but if this is a secondary device or you don't use much then like me save some money and get this without second thought.",
            "Perfect ipad killer.. perfect combo of tablet and pc. I have purchased the 4gb model. Decent performance and the hats off to microsoft for designing such a quality product. Battery life is good. Its super light , has just enough power to sail through basic tasks and the kick stand improves the flexibility.\nIts is slightly over priced because the type cover comes as an add on. Just wait a little more till the price of type cover comes down and you ll be fine.\nDo not forget that the windows 10 offers the users plenty of freedom if u compare it to the ipad.",
            "Loved the product Microsoft has nailed it , device is too good easy to carry , it is pro device for student developer yes I run visual studio , visual studio code with good performance, it can run entire windows smooth and heavy workload capable device",
            "it's been few days but it's working is good. As a student, it serves well to me as don't require heavy software. just browse net make my doc's on word, power, excel and one-note. so yes good for students. the keyboard specially is good so buy it, go ahead.",
            "The processor is not so fast. But it gets my work done. I use it for around 12 hours everyday. I mostly use it for typing and watching videos. I didn't find any lag or shutdowns. There is no perceivable heat buildup. After 2weeks.. I have no complaints. It is very much upto my mark. I haven't downloaded any games or used it for that purpose. Mostly Microsoft Office and stuff. The battery life though.. Is not as advertised. I get around 4 hours maximum. But the keyboard I got was very good deal. Quite fast and responsive",
            "Great product, I love this product\nIt's more useful for common people & students\nBetter than Android tablets because it's windows 10 flatform\nMulti tasking very well,\n\nMicrosoft makes good move.",
            "Since its launch, I wait for a long to have it... From July'18 to Dec'18 I just went through lots of review video and article. I'm writing this review, after 2 weeks of usage:\n\nNice design: It is exactly handy. The body made from the same magnesium material of Pro series. Loved the kickstand design. It fits in small pouch in my backpack.\nDecent Hardware: Though it is no mammoth, it can do multiple tasking flawlessly.\nPentium gold 4415Y processor really provides the power to make your daily work easy.\nThe pixel sense display is awesome. 1800 x 1200 resolution can stunn you. One can say it has thick bazels, but believe me, it won't be a drawback and it matches with the display. You never feel the bazels. one can use 0.3mm tempered glass on it (as I used) to make the screen scatchless and it retains the same touch response. I used surface pen on it and it responded as well.\nCamera is good and windows hello is awesome, though you need to improve the sensitivity from settings.\nI bought 8gb/128gb variant. It logs in within 30 seconds, with hello.\nBattery is good. One can get 4-5hours of backup in full charge.\nMagnectic 3 sides. Left side for attaching Pen, right side for charger, surface connector and lower side for Keyboard.\nPower button and Volume rocker is on top side.\nSound is really clear and crisp. it has 2 front facing speakers, woolsfen sounding did its work.\n\nAn absolute OS: Surface go comes with original Windows 10 home in S mode. I don't know, why it is called S mode may be die to security. It is one type of locked version of home. In this mode you can not install any 3rd party app, you have to download apps only from Microsoft store. But don't worry one can switch out to full version of home edition. If you need Pro version you have to purchase it from store and this will cost you half the price of the actual. This upgradation is one time (free) and non reversable.\n\nNow pros and conns.\n\nPros:\n1. Design is very beautiful and it is absolutely handy (only 522 gram). Feels premium product.\n2. Decent hardwares provide you the power to perform daily work, office work or home entertainment flawlessly.\n3. One can boast of the real OS. Though Win 10 is not so good for tablets but it is really a good OS.\n4. Awesome display and sound.\n5. USB type C 3.1 connectivity.\n6. Fanless silent design\n\nConns:\n1. Processor is not a mammoth but not messy as Atom processor. You can not run large SWs.\n2. Pricing in India is a bit high. With all accessoires, it costs nearly 69K (tablet+Keyboard+mobile mouse+pen), Keyboard is signature type then it costs nearly 73K. One can get premium ultra thin portable laptops like Envy from HP or Dell or Macbook(2017 model).\n3. Though MS claims 9 hours of battery backup, you can get only 4-5 hours.\n4. May heat while running, it emits low heat.\n\nSummary:\nOne can purchase this product if it used as an alternative. This product is really nice in built quality, design and performance in its class. It replaced my ipad pro.\n\n** I cut a star for the delivery of flipkart. This time it showed its bad ways. After placement of order on 22nd December'18 it delivered on 5th Jan'19, nearly two weeks taken.",
            "i bought it after a lot of contemplating to replace my main laptop (i3, 4+500gb) which i used only for watching videos, editing documents and browsing web and i am super happy with the performance and most importantly the form factor the small light weight tablet form, and i got 4+64 variant and its just fine for light daily tasks so go for it, i did not get the keyboard cover but i m thinking to get it",
            "right, if you were waiting for the perfect low powered tablet alternative that was powerful enough to run windows. this would fit your bill if it only weren't for the Intel Pentium gold on this device.\nIf you've set reasonable expectations for a device of this form factor, only battery life will disappoint you. i'd recommend waiting for the arm based (snapdragon 855) models when they come out. other than that....\ntop notch screen.\nbrilliant audio.\nthe surface type cover is a must have.\nwindows hello? flawless.",
            "Device is excellent in performance n battery backup is around 5-6 hrs n the fast charge feature is soo good n speakers are just awesome the kick stand is very innovative n it's too useful\n\nIn terms of gaming it's also good not the best",
            "If u want a tablet around 40k u can simply buy this. But u want a laptop like performance still u can give it a try. If u want performance then I won't recommend this. But this the best 10inch machine I have ever used.",
            "Fantastic Device.\n\nUsing it for last 2 months and it has delivered fully on my requirements.\n\nI am using 4GB 64GD version.\n\nWhy I bought it?\n\nBecause I have Desktop and I needed a small device for traveling, capable of laptop level performance.\n\nI was using a corei3 4th generation 4GB laptop. Why I mentioned it as my Surface is nowhere less than this.\n\nWhat I do on it?\n\nMultiple PPT, Word, excel and browsing windows opened and working at same time. And it performed well.\n\nI used it as a primary device during my long travel and it never let me down.\n\nIssue... My Surface charging adapter stopped working, but Microsoft sent a new replacement within 4 days. Thumbs up on service.\n\nI am fully satisfied on the price, performance, design and brand...",
            "Absolutely brilliant. Using it for last 2 months, 4GB ram is good. Never experienced any lags, but my requirement is limited to Tally ERP, word, excel (Microsoft office), emails, browsing & pdf. Exporting huge data from tally is also not a problem. Booting speed is faster than my 8GB i3 laptop. Switched from S mode to full windows, also installed printer. Display is beautiful but screen reflection is there, enjoyed lot of Netflix and prime videos. If the accessories were provided by Microsoft in the same price (or on a very lower rate) then this surface go would have been a tremendous hit. Camera quality is not that good, but nobody buys this to take pictures, it\u2019s sufficient for video calling. If your requirement is for a travelling or to complete quick work between things, you should definitely go for this. It also gives you two different charging options (using usb type C, min. 15 or 18 watts charger required). Don\u2019t worry too much about keyboard as you also have a on screen keyboard and touchpad options in windows (but I did bought the type cover), you can also connect usb keyboard using type c otg cable or Bluetooth. Didn\u2019t think I would write this much but, it\u2019s worth the long review. If you buy it don\u2019t forget to register it online for warranty (also provide them invoice to get full warranty)",
            "Excellent product. Perfect for my requirement. Super happy. Not using my regular laptop now. I have 4gb ram and it is adequate for daily use on the go",
            "Wanted to buy a new Surface device mostly for studying, watching videos, web browsing and note taking. Previously had a Surface RT. It died suddenly. Reviews of Surface Go, however, were mixed but mostly good. Decided to give it a shot. I have also added a 64GB microSD card for expansion.

            "Very good product from Microsoft actually this is a computer on the go.You can do all functions of computer on this.Very portable and useful device.Quality of this product is high class.You can use this for productivity works.Very useful for office and educational purposes.I highly recommend this for productivity works.Microsoft great work.",
            "Just one day of use and am sharing my review. Surface Go gets decently charged in an hour. Good standby time. Shuts down like PC and quickly starts up like a mobile. One time Ms office for Students can be purchased for lifetime use. Touchpads are quick and responsive with 4Gb Ram like a mobile. I would have given a 5 \ud83c\udf1f if I could have connected my wireless keyboard and mouse to this device. There is no USB port where I could connect my USB device. I am still trying to figure out if I can connect my wireless keyboard and mouse. If anyone knows please guide.",
            "is fast and handles most software efficiently .i have stopped using my desktop after i got this.if you are looking for a small n portable device then u can consider this.limited apps on microsoft store this is good for word ,excell internet browsing and media consumption.RECCOMEND you buy the keyboard with it and if budget permits go for the 128gb ssd version.",
            "I have been using the 64 GB/4GB RAM version for about 2 weeks now. I bought it along with the regular black typing cover (sold separately). So far I have found it to be extremely effective at everything I have thrown at it. And by that I mean, all the basic apps and purposes. I use MS Office a lot, watch YouTube, Netflix, read a ton of news, browse websites (many with heavy media) and some light games. And Go excels in all these areas. I have not used graphics intensive games (PUBG or Need for Speed), haven't used AutoCad, or Photoshop or done video editing either. If you're planning to do all of these, then this machine might not be for you. Look elsewhere. Or go with Surface Pro.\n\nFor the money you pay, you get a good value. It's extremely portable and light. With the type cover it is barely over 700 grams. The screen is better than most of the iPads. Color accuracy is amazing. Color reproduction is better than any other screen I have used. At 217 ppi the screen resolution and pixel density is sufficiently nice. Type cover is a delight to type with. Dual speakers support stereo output and they are a pleasure to watch videos and listen to songs with. They're also sufficiently loud, so most of time you won't have to use bluetooth speakers.\n\nThe battery lasts more than 7 hours at 50% brightness and at better performance settings(as opposed to what MS claims, which is about 9 hours), but you can probably make it last longer if you use the battery saver mode. For any light activity, if you're using it on battery saver mode, it doesn't affect the performance. As for the memory, if you're not installing too many apps, 64 GB should be enough. However, you do have the option of using an SD card, so that takes care of the problem. You might as well save money and go with 64GB version rather than 128 GB. The 8GB of RAM won't matter a great deal. Trust me.\n\nI would highly recommend it over iPad pro! You'll be doing yourself a great favour if you got this over an Apple product. Unless you're an Apple fan to the core. Watch some YouTube reviews and decide for yourself.",
            "extremly fantastic i recommend it to every one who want to second laptop ya fhir bole to ek secondary just like a tablet i fully satisfied........good one but some little bit improve in battery life all is good ...",
            "Amazing product, most apt for Windows n Office lovers... You can do everything for daily office jobs. The look n feel is fantabulos.

Must Buy the Combo, worth every penny!!\nHave been using for over a week now, no heating, absolutely silent, great battery backup(this is my secondary device), but have been using it like a primary device.\nThanks to Flip...\nREAD MORE",
            "Yes, the surface go is expensive for what it offers but it just feels right to get your hands on one. You may find the screen to be small if you've been using traditional Windows laptops. Windows 10 isn't as optimised for touch usage as well. But it doesn't dissapoint. The pentium gold on Windows S mode gives you low level underclocked i3 level performance. So I would recommend you to buy the one with ssd storage as that helps to boot up the device and general usage much faster. Overall a great entry level product from Microsoft. Just wish they get rid of the huge bezels next time.",
            "I bought the 64GB/4GB version only for media consumption and it perfectly fits my needs. The display is very good (vibrant and has up to 400 nits of brightness). You have to disable adaptive contrast which is on by default (makes the screen look dull but to save the battery I suppose). This device is good enough for word processing, lightweight browsing, and media consumption. Windows Hello facial unlock works pretty well even in complete darkness. Speakers are really good, they are two 2watts speakers (Dolby available on OS). The only downside is the battery which lasts about 4 hours, but it charges pretty fast. Buy it on sale you might get it at a pretty good price.",
            "Quite satisfied with the product.\n\nThe magnesium design feels solid in the hand and the device looks awesome.\nIt's a small device with the functionality of a full on computer. The screen seems cramped initially but once you start using, it's pretty usable. The bazels aren't as thick as they appear on advertisement and reviews.\nIt's perfect for browsing and media consumption, thanks to the dedicated kickstand, the screen can be adjusted at various angles for better usability.\n\nThe battery lasts a day easily with normal usage which may include browsing, streaming, video playback and a little bit of work.",
            "A good product from Microsoft, using it from 5 months, battery lasts 6hrs using it only as a tablet with out type cover experience is smooth got for 30k witch is same as international price, very good for basic computing build quality is great , a full windows machine with sufficient power as a basic computer can't expect more from a fanless, compact , 10 inch , windows tablet \ud83d\ude01",
            "Was skeptical of buying because of 4gb ram and pentium gold processor. But it\u2019s really good. Handles Visual studio code, blender2.8, main two heavy softwares that I use perfectly. Don\u2019t expect to create 3d models with a lot of polygons and you will be fine. Perfect for web dev on the go. Day to day works are flawless.\n\nIf you need Adobe products, try looking for alternatives. There\u2019s a AdobeXD alternative in windows store called Lunacy. It works flawlessly and is actually better than AdobeXD. For Photoshop, go for AffinityDesigner or something similar.\n\nMake sure to go out of S mode, and update the drivers.",
            "Surface Go 4GB has a reputation of being slow but we need to no compare this with an actual laptop. The performance is pretty adequate for a tablet and even as a laptop if you understand it limits. Within its performance limit it works very well and is very snappy. The display and touch are of very good quality and so is the build quality. It looks and feels very premium. Thee kickstand is very useful and type c port is also a good addition. The product is bery good but it has to be understood it is not capable of being a primary laptop. It works best as a primary tablet or a secondary laptop. If these are your use cases then the tabletworks very well. Getting Out of Windows 10 S brings lot of freedom but be cautious of installing software. Any bad software will impact the performance.",
            "Good portable 2 in 1 tablet and PC at the same time. Got windows 10 home, ideal for business purposes.",
            "Even though it wasn't flipkart assured, reached on time and packaging was good. It was as sealed and new as if buying from a store. Charges superfast and battery back up more than I expected. I like how it has a back stand, seems perfect to me as I can use it like a laptop on a table. I got it for a discounted price of 29,999 and now my brother wants to purchase it too. But the prices are again up to 37,999 .",
            "Tiny Machine to do your office work on the go !!! It is not powerful enough, but can be used to do office work and casual browsing. Although you can come out S-mode to install .exe applications, however, It is better to keep it as such for smooth functioning. It is not going to replace your laptop or main computer. Treat it as your secondary laptop, you are good to go.\n\nThe weakest link is the battery - hardly works for 3-4 hours, however, to compensate it, we can charge it with a USB-C charger. My Pixel-2 charges it in a decent quick time and I don\"t have to carry the supplied brick.",
            "The Surface Go is a good portable tablet plus PC. It can be used as a primary computer also if you use a lot of Microsoft word and checks e-mails etc. The storage provided at first seemed to be insufficient upon the first windows update but don't worry, removing the old windows file cleared maximum space in the disk. I have now 33.5 GB free space with latest windows 10 version. If you want to install apps from other sources than the Windows store, switch to Windows 10 home from S mode.\nOverall, i m highly satisfied with it's performance given my nature of work.",
            "Great product. Easy to use. The only downside is that if we want to keep the warranty we can only install apps which are available in Microsoft store. So no chrome and many other apps which we can download easily in other devices. If you don\u2019t use lots of apps for daily work and are just satisfied with Microsoft apps and edge as a browser then you would love the product",
            "This surface go is powerful but not like other full fledged laptops, users need to understand this machine is designed for productivity purpose and the CPU does not throttle to boost performance. But over all this thing can run games like fortnite, rocket league, Pubg lite etc but in lower specifications.",
            "I am very much satisfied with my Surface Go. It suits my needs perfectly. I use it for official and light work and it is perfect for that.\n\nThe display is very good though not the best in market but then I wanted windows in my pad and that was my first priority.\n\nTouch input in screen is sensitive and well calibrated and it works as well with 3mm tempered glass which I applied for protection.\n\nBattery back up has been pleasant in my experience with almost 6 hrs of non stop video playback on Netflix app and around 9 to 10 hrs if I am using MS Office. Reading ebooks on it is also supercool, as it supports chm, pdf, pdb all sorts of format. I can also mount virtual drives of my surgical atlases and run my less performance intensive simulation apps easily.\n\nDo remember to upgrade Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Home, as it is one time option, and it is free. You can continue with Windows S but it has many restrictions due to security, or alternatively you can purchase Windows 10 Pro from same link and upgrade to that.\n\nOnscreen keyboard is very easy to use and keys are evenly placed, I also purchased keyboard for surface go, which has made typing much easier and turns it to mini laptop anywhere.\n\nI don't use it for gaming so I can't comment on its performance on that, otherwise it is a great product.",

This has allowed me to leave my work laptop in the office and use this conveniently sized product when I need to answer mails or work on any task when I'm on the move. My concern was the processor and comparatively low RAM, but haven't had any issued yet. Would definitely recommend this as an add-on for someone who already has a decent laptop.",

However, the screen is a bit small, so not a very ideal primary device.",
