            "Product is really great...... Value for money..... Looks premium and delivers more than what is required...... Highly recommended for students and working people....... Camera is decent but struggles in low light..... Graphics are liquid fluid so while playing we get great experience...... Initial setup takes time but after that it is very simple and quick to use........ 3g or 4g u can get good surfing in Internet..... Happy with it.....",
            "Excellent product got it from Australia just after launch.\nThe product is worth every penny spent and it also supports wireless keyboard available in the market except that Apple smart keyboard.\nThis review comes after a usase of almost 20 days.",
            "It's very nice tablet..I bought it on BBD at RS 18400/- . After reading the reviews of sellers I was worried if I get a faulty product. But fortunately I received a brand new and genuine apple iPad. I am happy that i bought it from flipkart and also delivery was within the promised date.",
            "Excellent product. Great one for the price. Longer battery time. I gets around 7-8 hours battery even after playing games for 2-3 hours. Weight is little bit higher than iPad air. Charging is slower compared to other models. Great one for the price\n\nQuality packing from the seller as well",
            "Very good product . And Flipkart delivered it in 3 days only when I pre book it in first slot.\n\niOS 10.3.1 is running smoothly, pre filled with few good apps like numbers , keyboard...\n\nTue Value for money.",

            "I'm using the iPad 9.7 2017 since 1onth now and below is my review about it:\n\n(1) Screen - Absolutely stunning.\n(2) Battery - Easily lasts for a day with normal heavy use with full brightness.\n(3) Storage - I got about 28 GB out of that 32 GB mark. It is more than sufficient as I'm using it only for business presentation purpose.\n(4) OS - Very good operating system.(though I'm an Android lover)\n(5) Build quality - Comeon guys, any doubt about Apple devices' build quality? Solid build quality.\n(6) File transfer - It is a headache specially if you are used to Android. But it is manageable. Not so bad either.\n\nWhat more do you need from tablet at such low price?\n\nIt is a damm reasonable Tablet. Just go for it.",
            "Specially for Android users:\n(Frustratingly Amazing Product)\nWriting this review after 1 month of usage and Android users must read before purchase.\nThe iPad is definitely an amazing product but is it really that amazing... I doubt!\n\nI bought this product to read books n newspaper online and for that purpose it really does an amazing job.\n\nHere's where iPad s*cks !\n\n*While everyone knows the screen is not a laminated LCD but what most don't know is that screen makes a TAP .. TAP sound when u tap against it. The same sound u get when u tap on any Hollow surface. It's irritating at times.\n*Fingerprint sensor is kinda slow takes a little more than 1sec to unlock.\n*Battery backup is good but takes lifetime to charge!\n*Camera is between ok-ok and good in outdoor lights but images are grainy in indoor lights.\n*Doesn't support Whatsapp, Instagram, iwatch.. (mine is non cellular model). YouTube app doesn't have back icon, you'll have to search for the entire thing again. It's actually frustrating!\n\n*you'll need a laptop (i tunes) to upload songs, movies, books etc. Doesn't support OTG!\nYou can use SHAREit but anything received via it will be shown only in SHAREit app only.\n\n*Apps are much-much bigger in size than they do in Android. eg: WPS office 206 MB, One Note 166.7MB, MS Word 236.6MB, MS Excel 227.5 MB, Gmail 148MB, YouTube 123.6MB etc.\nSo If you're on limited monthly data pack then Beware! (Specially if you're starting fresh)\n\n*Finally comes the restrictions that iOS has in it. Even after 1 month of usage I still don't know how to download a subtitle for any movie that I'm playing. (I know it's shameful but believe me iOS only frustrates u as an Android user)\nCan't download songs, pdf etc.\nFile manager is biggest bluff in the history of any Android file manager app bcz it's no where close to any Android file manager. (Do search for more)\nAnd this is just the tip of the Iceberg!\n\n*doesn't support Apple pencil and other styluses with softer tips are harder to use because of non laminated display!\n\nPros:\nThe best part of this product which deserves applaud is it\n*doesn't lag\n*doesn't heat\n*Excellent RAM management\n*sound is not very loud but speakers are good\n*battery backup is good\n*Apps despite big size, open with ease, are crisp and smooth.\n*iOS 11 is good.\n*Display is good, you can filter blue light to read for longer hours. Bigger bezels are good for holding.\n*Looks very premium, people will definitely notice it when you carry it around.",

            "Anyone who thinks that he/she should buy an iPhone SE or iPhone 6 or so , you can buy this iPad .it's a perfect combination of iPhone 6s and an iPad , it have great battery life . I mean for gaming and studies it runs for 5-6 hours straight if your using for watching movies or so , for daily use it runs around 9-10 hours which is very good and takes about 3 hours to charge (100%) . For gaming it's very good , I have faced no lags and no FPS drops on this device as it's iOS in it + A9 processor . Just Rs4000 more than iPhone SE and you get much more abilities .",
            "Yes, I am perfectly satisfied with my IPad 2017. I had bought the 32 GB variant with WiFi only for my regular media consumption and study purposes and I must say that it does that very well. I love it. Games are super smooth with the new Apple A9 bionic chip. Display is top notch and you really get that premium feeling while using the iPad. I know it\u2019s very reflective in day light but common who uses iPad outdoors for checking notification. Battery life is super awesome. After watching two movies and 9-10 YouTube videos, I noticed that the battery was at 75%. I wholeheartedly agree that finally Apple has got the right pricing for this device, no denying that. If you are gonna buy it then do remember that at this price range you can easily buy other tabs having android as their OS like Samsung tabs. But do remember that they are very old. Also do remember that it\u2019s predecessor I.e. IPad Pro is also worth it if you have proper budget for it. But that\u2019s another thing.",
            "No doubt it's an Apple product. Outstanding performance. High quality sound and sound clarity is also very nice. Superb battery backup. No words will be there regarding screen resolution it's beautiful. But one thing I will mention that there is no flash for the back camera...Apple should have given it . I must recommend to purchase it..",
            "I am a genuine buyer and this product and seller are both genuine ..got an awesome deal from Flipkart thanks a lot :)",
            "This is my first tablet I bought, and it has been a great experience using it this far.\n\nTablets are typically being used as a replacement for the smaller mobile screens and the cumbersome laptops. I use my iPad precisely as a replacement for laptop.\nAlthough one cannot gat all the functionalities of a laptop, it can be used for reading, viewing presentations, watching videos, taking notes, doing MOOCs and many more!\n\niPad has the best battery backup and user interface. Although its priced on the higher side, I consider it an objective investment for the satisfaction it gives while using it!",
            "Great product. Excellent display and superb features. Battery back up is awesome. As it is said quality doesn't come cheap, total worth the money spent. Overall shopping experience enhanced by Flipkart by providing excellent service and quick delivery.",
            "Excellent product...Got it for 23,400 under flipkart sale...Can't get a better deal than this...Everything about this ipad is great..Battery life and performance better than earlier ipads..ios complements macOS perfectly..Those not getting case for this new ipad, go for covers of older ipad air 1..Fits perfectly and you can get it in market for Rs 400..Speakers though not loud but again get good headphones and there won't be any problem!!",
            "Damn cool, you are getting APPLE Ipad for this price range, grab it guys, its worth a every penny.\n.) Battery is awesome BIG\n.) Brightness,Display, You are getting every hardware components of Iphone 6s in this tab\n.) Best OS in the world IOS10. with A9\n.) you can play all high end games, presentation,reading everything...\n\nFinal suggestion, why even you are checking my review, just Order it.",
            "I ordered this Ipad just like yesterday morning and I am glad I did order this one. I surely researched a lot before taking this iPad (5th generation) as apple claiming it on website. I have used Ipad 2 (not to get confused by Air series) which i purchased back in 2011. Must I say, this iPad is cheapest in terms of price but it does NOT lack in performance. Camera is better in performance with features like LIVE PICTURE. It may be somewhat thick in comparison with Ipad air 2, but the difference it minimal, which can be avoided. in comparison, it is faster than IPad 2 Air. In all, for me, i feel it money worth.",
            "Smooth UI and crisp diaplay, i simply love this tab.\n\nThis is first time i am using a apple product. Compared to android Its very different when it comes to handling files.\nI caution people who are from android background. you will get irritated because of above reason. But once you are used to it, you are going to love this tablet.",
            "iPad is the best with price and also thanx Flipkart for slashed price by 4k.\nI have used tab as well but iPad have no comparison because of its powerfull CPU allow you to work with multiple app and no hanging . I will recommend first buyer don't go for other tab wait for offer it u short of budget and buy iPad its worthy of waiting.",
            "The best tablet worth investing for particularly if bought on offers. A good option for 1st time tablet owners or those upgrading from ipad mini models. Good performance, extremely good battery life and beautiful apps.",
            "Guys its totally a value for money i am writing this review after using the product for 3 months the ipad has a superb finish, powerful battery, it doesn't lag even playing heavy games like NFS, Asphalt even if all other apps are opened in background. The camera is not that good and also you won't be able to call via jio 4g voice apps as it is a wifi only model. Yes, you can use apps like imo for free call and message. overall i personally found this ipad super cool at this price point.",
            "I ensured to buy from Flipkart Assured seller (IndiFlashMart) hence no problem in packaging or the product itself. Talking about the product-it is sturdy, not very light but not on the heavier side too. The screen quality, resolution is the best in this range, perhaps unmatched compared to other tablets of similar size in similar range. The screen is 100% fingerprint magnet but not a problem.. For those wondering about the NON LAMINATED display, yes one can spot that gap but is not at all a problem. Don't let this hinder you from buying this product.\nI have been an android user and using iOS is easy, but it is worth mentioning that android gives way more freedom than iOS, but still, iOS-11 on iPad has its own beauty.. Absolutely love it.\nOther Things\nSpeakers- are very good.\nCameras - grainy in low light.. otherwise is descent.\nGaming is descent, haven't had any lags.\nThe back is probably polycarbonate i guess, but not metal for sure.\n\nOne would not regret having purchased this.. Not at all..",
            "This is my first apple device, I purchased this for Rs. 18400 in sales during durga puja in 2017 and l love it truly. It may be strange for a person like me who works only on Linux and android to like apple. When I purchase and opened iPad first time, I did not found file folder system, I got a bit disappointed. Anyway the best things I like about this device:\n1. The massive battery which is 32.5 Wh and it can last for 3 to 4 days with normal 3 to 4 hr on-screen reading and 1 or 2 hours of video watching on YouTube. My bluetooth and wifi are open all the time, in spite of that I charge after 3 or 4 days.\n2.The touch and screen is as smooth as butter.\n3. Does not heat while charging .\n4. Never saw lag in device even if 10 to 15 apps are running in background.\n\nI purchased this device for ebook reading and this is really good in that. I never felt need of hard copy. I carry all the books with me anywhere. I can put all my codes, files and folders for meeting and discuss there without carrying heavy laptop. I don't have to bother about stability of device.\nApart from apple's inherent problem of unavailability of free apps and incompatibility with linux or windows. This is awesome and it will increase your productivity. I never thought about any other device after purchasing this. Go for it you won't regret.",
            "ipad which i got from\nIndiFlashMart is flawless and ipad works great.. the delivery of flipkart was also before time. got the produck @ 20 k awesome",
            "This is my first apple purchase and the most pocket friendly apple device ever! Go for the 128GB variant. You'll need the extra space, trust me. Great product overall, go for it. If you're planning to get a a first tablet, think no more!",
            "Exceeded my expectations.I am a stock android fan.its my first purchase for an apple product.hesitated first,but finalize to give it a try.the iOS is more restricted than android.but once you know its limitations,you will adjust with it,as its ecosystem provide full peace of mind.Even with 2GB RAM,the memory management is awosome.And the battery life!!!its a beast.easily last for full 2 days even with heavy use.Great for media consumption.I would highly recommend it to anyone who want a premium build tablet for media consumption and browsing.",
            "It has great speed and everything. Typing out and mailing a document is real easy - that was my primary purpose of buying the iPad, to use it as a lightweight alternative to a laptop, and that purpose has been served. Also works very well with wi-fi, as I had hoped for.\n\nIt takes a little while to figure out that a side swipe from the right edge can show me all the apps - at first, I was continuously pressing the home button to go back to the apps menu and feeling irritated about this. The app display management could still have been better, but that's okay - I can live with this.\n\nThe reason I can't give the tablet a fifth star is the pathetic sound. There are two speakers but both are at the bottom of the device, and that means, whenever I watch something in landscape mode, the sound comes from one end of the device! Not expected from Apple. Even my tiny Moto e2 phone does better than that - it produces stereo sound in landscape mode, which means Moto's internal sound mechanism is better than Apple. Anything I watch on the iPad will require earphones; whereas, I don't always need earphones to watch a trailer on the Moto e2.\n\nOther than this, I am quite happy with the product.",
            "I ordered the product and got it the very next day. Prompt delivery.\nComing to the iPad itself, you cannot find a better value for money product. The trust and performance of apple is unlike any other brand. If you're thinking of buying an iPad and are on a little tight budget, go with this. You will not regret it. The screen is crisp, colors are saturated, battery is great and is extremely fast. What else do you want under 25000",
            "Awesome product , nice deal , thank you Flipkart for a great offer , the delivery was a day late , but awesome packing , safe and sweet as always .Happy with my purchase .",
            "The product is great. Infact, although the name seems a little suspicious, but even then seller is great. Good packing. But the one thing I really dislike is the ekart's delivery service. It's so pathetic, always crosses promised deadline, never ever arrives in time, courier boys are so arrogant and irresponsible, pos machine never works so always have to pay in cash. These little things make u a loser. Stop being a loser flipkart. Your own subsidiary ekart is going to sink u someday.\nNow, about product, it's awesome. Checked serial no. on the site, it's original with one year warranty. Bought 128gb grey, wifi only model. Display is awesome, don't listen to few people critising about lack of lamination etc. It's good and u barely can notice the air gap in grey model. Performance is good. Speed and battery life is also good. I suggest u to buy 128 gb model because overtime u fill it up fast and then worry about deleting stuff. Also it's new 64bit chipset makes it future proof. So, better than Air2 in that way. The only thing you don't get is apple pencil support. But you can always buy a Bluetooth stylus and a keyboard. So, overall good buy. You can buy it from this seller. But Flipkart delivery service needs a lot and I mean alooot of improvment.",

Unlike android tabs this pad still runs as smooth as if it still new.\n4) The product is actually of strong build quality.\n\nCons:-\n1) Charging is slow if you charge it with any other adopter other then its own\n2) Battery darling quickly while playing PUBG ie 1.5 hrs\n3) camera is not as good as other Apple products",
            "This is one solid product. I would have been happy with a 24hr delivery but flipkart just made it better by giving next day delivery. The screen is beautiful. iOS 11.2 looks amazing. Overall iPad is the only tablet worth considering. Its perfect.",
            "First Apple product.\nPrice offered at Flipkart is very much value for money.\nI have been using it since 24th October.\nBiggest strong point is BATTERY, which lasts for whole day weather one use it for surfing,video streaming & playing games.\nTouch is smooth like butter.\nBuild quality is superb as expected by Apple.\nPremium quality material used in this.\nDrag and drop function is fantastic which makes task fun.\nPicture quality is good when you use camera in full light.\nStorage is bit issue as I am using 32 GB version, but it is common in Apple devices when you go for small storage versions.\nMy advice for first time Tablet buyers,they must consider this Apple device.\niOS 11 like butter.\nLast thank you Flipkart for giving me this fantastic deal.",

            "Excellent offer by flipkart.I got this under exchange and SBI offer for 18400. I love my new beat iPad its faster than just fast. Storage Memory is 25gb initially which is good. Wanted to buy 128gigs but the offer was only on 32gigs. Everything is original nothing tempered delivered was as promised this review is after 10days of usage. So go blindly with this iPad if you want HD gaming on a retina display with crisp graphics",
            "Apple is apple. Just brought this for apple logo. I want a apple product. Only purpose is to show off in front of my friends. I could buy iPhone 6 at almost same price but this one is better as it has a9 chipset with is damn fast than in comparison with a8 chipset in iPhone 6. And it has a full hd display and better than hd display of iPhone 6. It's best in it's class. No company has launched a tough competitor to iPad. In comparison with iPad. All other companies make garbage tablets. I think it's the only market in which apple destroys their competitors ruthlessly (saying about tablet market). Neither it is a 7 inch or 8 inch ugly Android tablets (I'm Android fanboy still I hate those tablets) nor it's a outdated Samsung tablet. It's APPLE. It's antutu scores r 140k. Cool right. But it doesn't have flash in main camera, in selfie camera, it uses screen flash. As no-one use camera for clicking photos.... mostly...so no problem for me even if they don't have camera... Just the thing I needed from this product is just Apple logo. And even iOS 11 update is released for iPad. I m wondering that why Google can't do things quick like Apple. Android O is still not available in India and even iOS 11 is released and been available for update in iPhones and iPad. First apple product and I'm loving it. ;) And also I brought it in just 21k. Big billion days offer. ;)",
            "ekart service: excellent\nbuying experience at flipkart: Excellent, kudos to Flipkart for the great offers on the Big Billion days.\nProduct: it is an awesome product from Apple. Has the latest IOS 11, It is a delight for first time buyers of apple product. Possessors of Ipad Air may find it a downgrade.\n\nFew words for future buyers:\nonline buying ain't easy these days, there is always the fear that seller may cheat, the product may not be genuine, the product could be refurbished or defective. Besides, the large number of positive and negative reviews for the product leaves prospective buyers even more confused. Therefore I would suggest the following:\n1. Fix your budget first\n2. decide upon the specs you want based on your need : youtube reviews are helpful in this.\n4. see whether the product is from a good brand or not.\n3. see whether the product is flipkart assured or not, if it is flipkart assured then just go for it without even thinking twice, flipkart assured is a guarantee of quality and genuiness of the product,swift delivery in robust packaging.The seller cannot take you for a ride if the product is fassured.",
            "Wow!! Just amazing!!\nI've been an Android guy since beginning and Linux fan. Didn't expect much, except great build quality which was the reason to purchase it. But I am pleasantly surprised!!\nThe heart of the tablet is A9 processor which is equivalent to Snapdragon 820 in benchmarks and more powerful in real life thanks to optimised iOS. It also has M9 co processor for augmented reality!\nBattery life is mind blowing for someone coming from Android like me. It easily exceeds one day after heavy usage!\nThe OS experience is flawless and much better than Android.\nOnly cons are its camera and low sound. I didn't find any issue with the display, as other reviewers state.\nOverall, it was a steal deal at \u20b919,900!!",

At 23,400 (Flipkart sale), I couldn't have asked for a better deal.",

Screen colors are also great. The iPad is currently on iPadOS 13.5.1 and it's running smooth. The device doesn't even heat while playing graphic demanding games like pubg and it's 3 years old. Overall I'm satisfied with the product. I wonder how long it will last and continue to perform flawlessly.",

Very good display for this price and speaker loudness is good for entertainment and movie. Camera is not that much good but it is acceptable that it's a tablet. Battery is long lasting once it's full then you use it for internet over wifi, watch movie/video, listen music, documentation work for the whole day without thinking about the battery.\n\nNote This review is written after using 4 months and current installed OS version is\niOS 12 Public Beta 4.",

Delivery is below mediocre.. iPad won't disappoint y'all..If you can buy it between 20-22k go for it..I gifted this to my girlfriend and she loved it..Don't buy above 22k wait for the correct price and go for it..",

The product came nicely box packed although the delivery was bit late taking almost 7-8 days to be delivered but after that it has become an integral part of our daily life. But the iPad is only provided with a non-sticky slender plastic cover without any lamination which is a tiny lil negetative of this otherwise mesmerising gadget.",

            "Pros : Good looking, bright display, good battery backup\nCons : A bit slow, speaker quality very poor, take a lot of time in charging.",
            "First of all, let me tell about the iPad...\n\nDisplay:\nThis iPad 2017 comes with a 9.7 inch Retina Display.\nMany reviews might have told us that the display is not up to the mark. But, thats not the case actually... The display is just great. No issues whatsoever.\n\nThe OS:\nThe iPad comes with iOS v10.x.x installed. As soon as you check for a software update, you will get your iPad updated to iOS v11.x quickly. And speaking of iOS v11, theres pretty much difference between what you might have seen in iPhones and what you are about to witness in the iPad. There is the dock feature similar to what we might see on the MacOS. And, multitasking layout has been changed. Although there are a ton of improvements, iOS 11 seems a little annoying when it comes to the notifications area. Accidental touches might land you on other apps.\n\nCamera:\nThe camera quality is great. Typical iPad camera quality can be expected.\n\nPerformance:\nOffers good performance with occasional lags here and there. Otherwise, it is suitable for multitasking and such as that. We tried a few games and all of them worked well.\n\nBattery Life:\nBattery life has been very great as this iPad comes loaded with a massive 8875 MaH battery. Have not charged it yet since the unboxing.\n\nVerdict:\nValue for money!\n\nFlipkart Service was a bit disappointing this time due to the festive period cause the delivery was delayed. They used to be prompt in their delivery, except for this time. Hope they do not do this again to loyalists like me. Otherwise, the packaging and product were in superb condition.",
            "Typical Apple performance birthed out of the seamless integration of software and hardware... Delightful... Exellent ram management... - Android can learn a thing or two. Personally , I am not pleased with the reflective screen (non-laminated display) found in this 2017 IPAD - One star less.",
            "Build quality looks good , feel bulky when u hold it with single hand , as i m using ipad first time so didn't able to other cons\nAt the end the device is best for its price section , i got it for 19k during festive sale in October 2017 , One of the best gadget i have",
            "iPads are best tablets available in the market. And this one is special because Apple has removed all suffix from it and they are calling it just an \"iPad\". I am using it for 6 months now and I find only one problem. Speakers could be bit louder on the device because you need to use bluetooth speakers or headphones while watching shows or movies in it. I bought it for a bit of sketching and drawing work too but my Adonit Jot Dash stylus gives wavy lines in this iPad. So I was bit disappointed. If you are looking for a tablet to create and edit drawings and sketches, go for iPad pro.\nAbout the display and toch, nothing can compete iPad tablet in this. Brightness is perfect and touch experience is amazing. About the battery life, if you charge battery 100 percent, you can watch videos or play games continuously for 4 to 4.5 hours. Standby time is 10 to 12 days. I recently got iOS 11 update and it's working well with it. You might face a problem with finding it's cases and covers, because they are hardly available at any iStore . If you have budget of 15-16 k to buy a tablet , just add some money and buy this one. You won't regret. I am giving 4 stars because I am not satisfied with sound quality.",

It is smooth, it is wonderful and it manages all the heavy tasks you can expect from a device. All the stuff is managed at one point and it's my tab....oh I mean iPad. You can surely go for it if you still believe in iPad (tablet). Great movie experience and great heavy work management.",

Great buy, this is my second.. earlier i was using ipad4 which was still working fine but had to upgrade it coz of its weight and some lags which all apple products suffer post ios updations.\nThis is a beast and i am happy to be using ipad for all my work all over again. Very slim and light weight, it also has a front flash light, strangely not there for rear camera.\nAnd on top of that i have got it for 18400/- as purchased it during big billion days with a sbi credit card.",
            "This is my first Apple... never been a fan of mac/ios. Besides, I thought they are overhyped and overpriced. This bargain in the Big Billion days prompted me to finally buy an apple product.\n\nPROs -\nIts a good piece of hardware - neat, slim, premium. Impressive display, fairly decent sound quality, finger print sensor works like a charm. Haven't fiddled around with the camera much (too large to go around shooting with). Solid impressed with the battery life. Fantastic wireless connectivity (using my phone's 4G hotspot). No lag whatsoever, A9 doing its best.\n\nCONs -\nThe principal reason behind staying away from Apple for soooo many years has been the software. Symbian, Windows (mobile), Blackberry, Android - name it, I've used it. Do NOT like iOS / Mac. And all my apprehensions came true. I am an avid user of technology, and like to have the extreme flexibility in the OS, which Android offers (followed by Blackberry, followed by Windows). I am damn cheesed off with the file system of iOS (that too this being iOS 11 we are talking about here).\n\nSUMMARY -\nGreat entertainment device, but what I actually needed was a portable workstation.",
            "Good tab. UI is lovely what Apple is known for. Good 9+ hours battery backup. But it takes long time to fully charge the battery. 20k by flipkart was a good deal with no cost emi option.",
            "Best quality product from Apple at very affordable price...if you are looking for tablet in this price point then go for this blindly. Its the best tablet in terms of display, Battery life , processor and everyday usage....it will never fail over your expectations. It is also a worthy upgrade for those who are using iPad air 1 or before model..Although it lacks a laminated display but the increased brightness given by apple compensate of absence of laminated display...It is having the brightest display for any iPad even brighter than iPad pro series and it is having the best battery for any iPad . Its battery life is better to even iPad pro as it is having 8900mah battery higher than 7900mah in iPad pro 9.7 inch",
            "Awesome product at awesome price !!! I got this Apple ipad (2017) for only 18900 on the big billion day. It was quite easy to get it on bbd( big billion day). At first I was beer worried about the product quality but thanks to flipkart and the seller , they sent me right product with original packaging and the delivery was also on time and fast . About the product :- Pros :- 1) it is quite comfortable for the person who doesnt uses PC much often . 2) around 9000 mah battery gives good battery backup. 3) ios 11 gives the macOS feel (a bit only ) 4) sound quality is good 5) screen quality is pretty good at this price point of rs 19000 5) excellent build quality.6 ) screen is clear and crisp 7) apple a9 processor and m9 motion coprocessor handles every thing neatly 8) no lagging or heating issues at all\nCons :- 1) screen is good but it should be laminated but its ok 2) no stereo speakers 3) Apple Pencil not supported But they are not deal breakers ....................Dont think about it just go for it ....",
            "Awsome display, Awsome battery life of the product and great service by Flipkart. The battery easily lasts 24 hourse despite having full hd ratina display which is immersive and mindblowing. The feel is super premium! However android users will feel a little difficult in using it since navigation and UI is completely different from android, some times you are left wanting for more in iOS. update to iOs 11 is available and I updated my device immediately after receiving it.",

I bought this product during the Independence day gadget sale along with HDFC instant cash back. It costed me 23400. 32 gb is a little cramped up storage but can you can definitely agumen it by using a wireless pendrive, like the SanDisk wireless connect. The retina display is brilliant, iOS 10 is fluid, multitasking is great and the battery life is excellent. There are reviews complaining about the non laminated display, but believe me it doesn't matter at all. Normal users do not notice it.",

Sound quality is great and u feel like listening to songs on ur ipad again and again.camera is below average( hardly matters for a tab).",

It's hard to beat this tablet at this price\n*Typical apple high built quality\nCons:\n*The display is non laminated and hence the colours are not as vibrant as on a laminated display plus it makes the screen a lot more reflective(You'll not even notice it if you haven't held a device with a laminated display)\n*It's a bit thicker than the Air 2 that it replaces (probably because of the extra battery- so I don't mind)\n*They have removed the physical mute switch which I liked so much\n\nConclusion: Hard to beat package at this price",

The Pro is a waste of money unless you really want to use the Apple Pencil. Delivery was delayed by Flipkart's Ekart.

Worst service overall.",
            "This one star rating not for apple product. But this is about the seller and Flipkart. Still I can not believe this and never expected from Flipkart I was shocked now a days how they are handling their customer issues.\nHere is my problem I ordered ipad from the seller indiflashmart and the iPad was delivered on 11th October. But my iPad box was damaged at the corners very badly and when I opened it there are dents and scratches on my IPad but time god working fine so far. and another shock was that I purchased from seller indiflashmart but I received invoice from the health and happiness pvt.ltd. Is it both the sellers were same or not? My product which I received was original or not? These are the big questions well, there is another big question that is it a real Flipkart once changed about the shopping style in India. So I immediately informed the same to customer support but I was told that I will hear a solution from the team. I will receive a call before 14th October with a solution but nothing happened. Then I again called the customer support about my problem then customer executive told me that I will receive a call within 24hours on high priority basis. Still nothing happened so here Im scratching my head and desperately waiting for a solution.\nThis how the business works and treat the customers once you raise your funds very high and sat on the top and grown as a big e-commerce organisation in India?\nThis is how the customers will be treated after made the big purchases and luring into so called great offers with low standard products?\nThis is how f assurance works?\nDo I need to trust Flipkart, as even it mattress to Flipkart in anyway? May be they have millions of customers.\nNo words to say. It is very shame on Flipkart for not providing the simple solution and a small communication to customer. Failing in basic funda of whole e-commerce business.",
