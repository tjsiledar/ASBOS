The user interface is dull. Better download asus launcher for better experience. Specially the Battery as far as 6200 mah is concerned is not that great. Charging is also an issue as it takes almost 5hours to full 100% status. Better use a fast charger( 2amp) available in the market. However multimedia experience is worth the price.

Two gb of ram never lets you down, no lagging what so ever. Touch is butter smooth,highly responsive. Jio 4g voice calls and internet works effectively.

Camera is average, you will not be able to click good quality pictures. Battery back up is fine.\nOverall if you are getting this in price range of 9k then it is fine.

            "I was planning to buy a new tablet for my mother as her old one was of no use now. Had the ipad mini 2 in sight but ios is again a cumbersome thing to operate so eliminated it. As the tablet industry has not kept pace with the mobile industry the options were very less. Than I went through the reviews of this tab and decided instantly that this will be my moms next new tablet.\n\nBuying from Flipkart is so easy and fast. No need to roam around and search for a worthy product. All in all I was really impressed by Flipkart and its seller who has packed the tablet marvelously.\n\nI won't list the specs as flipkart has clearly listed them. my review will be around the performance of the tab and some short comings that I encountered in a day of use.\n\nPros:\n1) Screen clarity is truly nice although as I use a Sony Xperia z5 premium which has a 4k display and a Samsung galaxy s6 edge which has a 2k resolution still I noticed that actually the screen was quite nice for this tab given its price range. although a full hd display would have been so so rocking.\n2) The touch sensitivity is really good and it responds to even slightest of touch.\n3) The Dolby Atmos speakers are amazing. even better than my last kindle fire hd tablet which too had 2 speakers with dolby atmos. listening to songs is so much immersive with dolby atmos. Kudos to Lenovo for giving such great music experience.\n4) Just as I did the initial setup it prompted for new system update and voah now it is marshmallow version of android. I also was able to register my 128gb sd card as internal memory which is a great feature of Marshmallow. Kudos to Lenovo again and their commitment towards their customers.\n5) All mid range games ran well.\n\nCons:\n1) Sometimes I observe a occasional lag when switching between apps or clicking the menu button.\n2) The tab is a bit on heavier side although not that alarming.\n3) High end games cannot run smoothly because of a lower end processor and poor GPU.\n4) A bit awkward to hold because of the inbuilt stand but than that is what makes it stand apart from bunch of tablets.\n5) No full control for Dolby Atmos.\n\nThese are some of the impressions I have after using it for full one day heavily. Its a definite buy if your budget is below 16k and you don't like that torture of ios and mind it its a hd screen and at a lower ppi so don't expect that crystal clear video playback as Sony Xperia Z5 premium or Galaxy s6 edge can do. Thanks for reading my review :)",
            "In low price range, this tab comes with good configuration viz. dolby sound, 2gb Ram and 8MP camera is an excellent product to buy. Also the 6200 mAH power battery boost the excitement",
            "They could have given some more of memory space. Finding suitable SD card for this is a real tough thing. So you need to rely on pendrives. The speed is like decent. Not that great. Other than these two, no complaints. Worth having.",

            "It's good , sound clarity is amazing and display is good compare to any other devices in price segment.",
            "Definitely the best 8 inch budget tablet one can find in India due to:\n1)Very strong build with premium look\n2)The best: Battery lasts more than 2 days for an average user(reading, browsing, etc). It took 3 days to come to 40% of the battery in idle condition\n3)Qualifies for 4G VoLTE\n4)Very receptive and quick touch\n5)Very little bloatware(from Lenovo) and is almost stock android(Lollipop)\n\nFew Cons:\n1)Finding accessories is a night mare. You will find most on Amazon India(Cheaper on eBay though).\n2)Little bulky(obviously due to the bigger battery)\n3)Marshmallow(6.0.1) in the tab would turn it into a dream machine(will save a lot of battery).",

As per my requirement this is a good product. Otherwise for people whose priority is Super camera and games, don't go for it. With 2 GB RAM and 8 MP camera, you don't have much to do.",
            "Got it for around 10k. A great buy optimal size and performance. Camera is good. Pro elite case is best for it.",
            "This tablet is fabulous. I am writing this review after 4 months of heavy usage.. This tab gives awesome feedback. Only lag I can find is it starts hanging sometimes. The battery backup is superb it literally works for more than 26 hours even with heavy usage. I don't play games over it. But for reading purpose it's the best. If you want a tablet for reading or watching stuff go for it.",
            "I specifically got the 2gb RAM price which was available at a cheaper rate than a competitor website. Using it for more than 6 mts now. Had done an inital update to Android Marshmallow.works flawlessly. Happy with the product.",
            "I have been already using a Lenovo tab and got one for my sister too because of its superior quality. The offers on big billion day were superb too..now I feel a bit cheated for the first time I bought my phone as now I got the phone at 2/3 price.. awesome",
            "Very nice tab nice performance and sound quality is awesome I recommend you to buy this in Flipkart big billion days because I got this product only in 11899",
            "Flipkart delivered the product in good condition. Yoga 3 Tablet is good for the price but the touch sensitivity and speed could have been better. I liked the ergonomics of the tablet very futuristic and handy. This is a good buy for 11K on big billion sale",
            "A powerful media device that perform smoothly and sounds powerful while doing it.\n\nThe tablet has good battery backup. Rotating camera is a smart value addition.\n\nThe Dolby audio is clear, loud and amazing. Stand is also great.\n\nCons:\nGaming preformance seen so far is poor. Major lags and screen drops happen often even though it has 2GB ram onboard.\n\nOut of box support to 4G VoLTE calling is not there. You have to install the Jio App for calling.\n\nNot a fan of the orange stickers on the screen.",
            "The product was delivered neatly packed and the product is really good with all the features for this price.But my personal remark is that it contains Google edition UI which is disturbing since i am using HTC ONE E9 which has HTC Sense UI.\nBut apart from this,the tablet really easy to use.\n1.the rubberized back is really protective.\n2.back stand is useful\n3.Dolby atmos is the best to watch from,even playing games is tooooo fun.\n\nCons:\n1.the company should have provided the screen guard for the tab themselves in the pack since we cannot find good quality screen guard online(My friend got screen guard and back case along with his Lenovo Vibe X3)\n\nBut its a worth a buy if you want a economical tab with both sim and WIFI features and really good against ipad mini which comes around the same price range as this.I compared all the tab and found this worth and i dont regret this decision.",
            "The thing looked and felt solid at start. Then I started to compare it with other devices and came to the conclusion that this thing is not worth the trouble and money. And it's proving that to me every day.\nYeah It got 2 GB ram. Well I have a Moto E and it works smoother than this Yoga Tab 3. There are this Lag and freeze in everything you do. Swiping on the home screen or app pages the animation is always stuttering. The apps especially browser with lots of images or contents closes in the middle. The play store or google account does not load or get logged out for no reason. You have to restart the device to fix it. and last the display. Its not a phone and it got a large screen so you dont have to keep it close to your screen. That's a good thing. But when you do you see every single pixels. Zoom a picture or text then you hate yourself for doing it. The ends of alphabets looks jagged and wiggly. Watching movies and all is ok. No major problems. But if you try to be a perfectionist you can feel that the frames are not moving that fast. Come Intense fight and action scenes it feels like some frames have been skipped. These are the major problems. Now comes things which are problems for some like as follows.\nThe screen shot option ( power + volume down ) does not work at least for me.\nWhen connected to PC There is no SD card. Only internal memory is shown.\nYou cant write anything on it connected to PC. Only reading.\nUSB Tethering does not work. So with Gio as a modem no hope. But with WiFi may be Ok..\nSo far its been the cons\nThe any pen technology is great. You can use it as a notebook kind of Tony stark. Type write or snap a pic of the note and highlight in it all at the same time. with fingers or with pen or pencil or anything that you see fit.\nBattery also is great.\nThe thing is heavy but feels solid. Hard to hold it in one hand.\nMy tab died on me on third week. Gave it for warranty service. After that it creeks like a cheap toy everywhere you touch.\nSo in my personal opinion after 3 Months the cons exceeds the pros in such a large margin. And given the price tag\nThis tab is not worth buying. Chip in an extra 2000 then there is that IPad.\nor take 6000 away then there is Mi tab.\nWhatever you do Dont buy this one\nAnd its not only me - the technician at the store where i took it for warranty service also suggested me that there are a lot of glitches with this model.\nSo better keep away from this one.",
            "Dolby doesn't require any words to be appreciated, you can feel the sound. The tab overall works smooth, 2gb ram makes tasks more convenient. With 8 inch screen and its offers a unique reading atmosphere with its blue light filter technology. As everything today is available in e-format and it supports any pen technology, I can read any book, in any format, its my individual effort to saving paper.",
            "Nicely poised and carved.... Bit heavy to hold.... Edges super smooth... Touch great on quick swift touch but lags a but on fine slow motion scrolling... Picture quality great.. ? is ufcorse a usp... 8 inch overall gud for reading... But 10 inch is best......high end covers available ranging Rs 1500 n above wid camera spot..Rest are useless.... Great service from flipkart.... Authentic packaging and sound courier service....",

            "I was confused before buy with Lenovo Yoga Tab 8\" 2GB Ram or samsung A Tab. But after watching youtube video titled: \"Lenovo Yoga Tab 3 (2GB Ram) Unboxing and Overview \"by Shubham Jha I purchased this Tab nearly 15 days ago. Today i will say Bestest Tab.Becoz of thick side edge(speaker and stand side) easy to catch this 8\" inch tab. , inbuilt stand, Really best battery backup, smooth touch experience and quick wifi connectivity. \"Android Marshamallow Upgrade\" is available.\nDo this:-- After unboxing First Charge Tab. Start it. Dont sign using google account. skip it. Now install update of 80MB, next update of 70MB, Now install upgrade of Android 6 with 1070MB, next update will be 555MB, And Final March-2017 patch update of 92MB. \"You need 2GB of pack for upgrade i.e. initially. You are ready to use. Now sign using google account. update apps. Some apps can be disabled if not using. You will save RAM of background Use.\nFor songs can use preinstalled dolby app for sound. Really i loved this yoga series tab.\nOnly 1 drawback is charger is litle bit slow. But if you are patient then you will definitely buy it.",
            "Just awesome... A no doubt buy. Got it for 15.4k frm Flipkart. Has 2 issues so getting it replaced. Its possible as its a device. Flipkart has best service n thank u for that. Device is awesome. Good performance. 2 things to note. Camera is good. Whenever u receive/make calls it automatically turns on speaker. So everyone around u can listen to ur conversation. Overall a best one by range",
            "Awesome delivery by Flipkart. Received the product within 48 hours of placing the order. The packing was very good. The Tab is very sleek, however feels a bit heavy. The camera quality is good. The finish of the Tablet is also good and feels premium. I would advice to get a screen guard during purchase as there is no protective layer on the tablet. First impressions- value for money.",
            "It satisfies most of the parameters that a person would be looking for before buying a Tab.\nGood Battery back up. Continuous 3 movies watched (2.30 hrs avg) and played Fifa for 1 long hours. still battery showing at 30%.\nGood Camera.\nVery sensitive and good touch screen.\n\n4 STAR - cos camera not having flash. Struggling to buy cover/case.",
            "I liked the tab but also didn't like some things\n- the JIO sim does not work well\n- sound quality is awesome\n- battery...... The beast I saw three movies continuously and the battery came from 92%- 66%\n- heavy ganes cannot be played it gets lagged\n- graphics are nice\nIt is my personal opinion so don't think it that was\nThank you",
            "This is an amazing tab. Worth every penny. Actually compared a lot of tabs before buying this one.\nPros\n1)Amazing dolby atmos sound (which is best in market)\n2) Battery backup is pretty good (6200 mAh !!!!!! Not something that would leave you in the middle!)\n3) HD display\n4) Supports OTG (pendrives with android pin can be used directly with this product)\n5) 180\u00c2\u00b0 rotatable camera (you don't need 2 cameras!)\n6) Anypen technology (you can scribble with just anything - forks, pens, pencils.. Now forget stylus!)\n7) 2GB RAM is pretty good for your daily work.\n\nCons:\nNothing much that you would change your mind\n1) Not full HD\n2)4 GB RAM would have been amazing but considering the cost, this RAM is pretty much worth for money",
            "First, excellent work Flipkart! Ordered the product at 3:00 pm in the afternoon and it got delivered by 11:00 am the next day. Before 24-hrs. Wow!\n\nComing to the product itself (writing this review after 12-days of usage):\n\nIt is a well-designed model from Lenovo and quite cost-effective too. The screen is HD so even a ppi of 189 is ok; touch is smooth and highly responsive; of course, the best part is the kickstand. This is a truly thoughtful innovation from Lenovo and congratulations to the...\nREAD MORE",
            "I am writing after nearly three months time. Everything is fine. The Tab is just fabulous. It is handy and good looking. The 2GB RAM makes it a speedy machine. The Camera is an OKAY type, sound quality is very good. The screen is awesome. The best part is the stand, which gives the Tab it's Yoga pose. I got this at 13K. And, the delivery was before the scheduled time.",
            "A Very good Tab for the price I paid. I was not sure if it's original. Because, Lenovo's website didn't feature this config at all. But somehow it has what's mentioned here. A 2 GB RAM is really good and the processor is sleek. My daughter loves it. She uses the rotating camera perfectly for her toy videos. The only downside is that there are no good quality covers available in the market.",
            "This product is good sound quality is amazing yaar it have rotating stand is very too good and it have also rotating 8 mp camera is amazing but it have no flash, It have battery backup is good an it's size good but little bit heavy weight",
            "Got the tablet during big billion day for only under 11K.\nFollowing is the initial impression after using the Tab for a week.\n+ Looks premium. Matte finishing adds to the look.\n+ Multimode stand is very very convenient\n+ Audio quality is impressive\n+ Got updated to Android M on the 1st day itself. Cool.\n\n- Would have given 4.5* if possible becuase Anypen is not so accurate. Doens't recognize many objects like pen etc. It just seems to be a gimmick. Bad.\n- Screen resolution is not that great. Pixels visible and fonts are not very sharp (I've used nexus 7 till now which has very good screen). But, at this price point, we shouldn't expect too much.\n- No FM radio",
            "Post 7 months use:\n\nIssues:\n1. Touch screen: Ultra Sensitive, takes random inputs very often. Sometimes you type one letter and it types 5 times. No successful method to solve this issue.\n2. WiFi Hotspot creation: Only WPA or No Security password settings allowed. WPA2 not allowed. Some of devices may face connection problem.\n3. Camera: Position on extreme corner makes selfie quality bad. Also, not easy to well position to take pic while camera placed on back. Moreover, rotating it is not convenient. However there is an added benefit of taking pic while placing the can on side.\n4. No flash. (So also no torch function)\n5. Weight imbalance: Makes it difficult to operate in portrait mode while holding in hand. However this is a special design which has several benefits.\n\nPros:\nSound quality\nBattery backup\nLook\nStand mode\nBuild quality\nSlim body (except base)\nValue for money",
            "One of the best tablets available in the market with LTE connectivity. Sound is awesome and better than any other tablets. Weight is a bit more that hinders you from holding it for too long! Else, holding position is like a book which is very user friendly.\nUpdate after 2 years: The only drawback is the absence of VOLTE which limits the use of Jio SIM for regular calls. Performance is good, but not great and it's not for heavy gaming.",
            "Value for money\n\nTablet is just great If your not looking for heavy gaming then just go for it and the battery life is excellent expectional it can stand 2 and half days easily with normal usage and the tablet with 4G what else you want I don't know about jio but airtel 4G works smoothly \ud83d\udc4d",
            "Very good product as per the price. Only lacking thing is that it is not VoLTE enabled. If u use a 4G sim card like jio then u can make calls only with the mobile data on. Dolby sound feature is good. Very good for games & movies.",
            "First of all kudos flipkart. All the four items of my cart have been delivered in time with perfect packing. Got this beast of Lenovo at Rs 10790/- in flipkart Big 10 sale. Superb tablet from the price point of view. Excellent display, rocking dolby sound, 2 gb ram & above all the innovative back stand with 180 deg rotatable camera make it so popular for day to day web browsing, watching movies in youtube etc. Not suitable for heavy gaming. Just go for it keeping in mind the brand 'Lenovo'.It will meet all your expectation.",
            "Positive\n1. Battery life. It runs whole day.\n2. Looks are cool\n3. Touch and Sound is too good.\nNegative\n1. Heavy one. Can't carry everywhere.\n2. No accessories available in local market.\n3. SUPPORTS 4G NETWORKS SO JIO LTE is not available so cant use jio for calling.",
            "The best tablet in India at this price range (well that's given the availability of tablets in the market lately unless one would go for imported products)\nNever been more happy with my reluctant decision to purchase it\nYes it's not HD display but I bet there's not much difference when it comes to media streaming and watching movies, oh! the dolby surround audio! ( it's like listening to a walkman! Or even better you're in a theatre watching the transformer saga or you've already watch the furious 8! (Well thats absurb) or takes you to viewing a formula one, rally racing.\nThe design is elegant almost flawless, the grip is ergonomic (firm)\nOrientation is 360* which one do not find in any/many other tablets lately in the Indian market except with flipkart apps and it's like where orientations are sometimes restricted to some apps.\nThe voice call quality and range is superb and hands free is mild but decent, would'nt ask more and mind you without a handsfree device one would be taken back to the 90's which is not only awkward but an embarrassment to your already swag style.\nWhat I do not like was the size of the apps on the screen though UI is sleek but not silky which may be because I've always been a fan of Sony and iOS (oh! the UI of sony, silkyness of iPads!) But one do not get a sony or ipad at this given price and WHAT? the price was @18k at December when I bought it. At the end of the day you get what you pay for; every cent is worth.\nIT IS GOOD TO HEED A WISE MAN'S ADVICE BUT WISER IS THE MAN WHO ACTS ON IT. So why wait if you're planning to get one because I bet no other tablets are lined up for new product launch till date, sadder is that no (premium) tablets ever comes to the INDIAN market anymore.\nWhat? Oh! The camera...? It's not iPad but the 8mp does its job decently and yes it rotate 180* so, what more can I say.\nWell, thats most of it if features and specifications are not a concern to your query so Happy Shopping!",
            "Hardware wise best in market even better than ipad I would say! it's case is difficult to find but available online. Better to buy a tablet sleeve and apply one tempered glass. In terms of software I did not find any issues but paying a little extra for ipad is worth it ( I own both). Display and performance everything is above average. Camera is better than ipad mini 2. Dolby sound is also suerb. It has few amazing features like any pen, smart view.Go for it if you want a standard tablet with best looks",
            "Received the package in 1 week but in a very good condition. Battery life is good, not the satisfied with any pen technology. Apps are not that good for writing, planning to order a stylus. Anyways worth buying.",
            "Best feature of this tablet is its adjustable stand and rotating camera.\n\nThis tab can be kept in any position and it has a single 8 MP camera which rotates in 180 degree direction and can be used as front as well as back camera.\n\nBattery is good, display is good. It has 2 GB RAM so speed is also good.\n\nThe only issue is its charging point. When I plug in the charger, it goes in well. But when I have to take out the charger, it gets stuck. Due to this it feels like its charging point is going to be damaged soon. Otherwise the product is very good.",
            "The finish and the external appearance are just brilliant! We bought this tab for my wife, as a replacement to her old Nexus (2012 model), and this was a great step-up! Seamless performance, very nice screen resolution and a very decent battery life - it pretty much replaces your tiny PC. I would certainly recommend this!",
            "I was worried if it is a real product. Didn't find a mention of this tablet (2GB RAM) on any news/review website. The first thing I checked when I receieved the delivery was its RAM, and it was indeed 2GB.\n\nProduct is great. Display is better than good, could have been little more better. Multiple apps can run with ease. Sound is amazing. Supports my computer's keyboard through OTG. Played a 3GB full HD movie without any lag. Haven't played any game yet, but I am sure there will not be any issue. A little heavy, but the battery and the stand justify the weight. Lenovo claims 20 hours battery life, I easily get 16-18 hours on a 3G network. No flashlight, but then it isn't meant for photography. Decent enough Camera in low light, better in day light.",
            "i purchased this on filpkart independence day sale got it for 9k and this is my 1st Kenobi product after all use 1week it works with no issues and no update received like they said in comments it's still in android 6version the internal storage is very low(16gb) compared to honor tab performance is good but cam quality is not so good for 8mp it's like 2mp and battery back is superb , rest of all are works better i give 3 rating out of 5",

They are extremely happy using it. Battery life is superb. Jio sim works on it for internet purpose but for jio voice calling had to install the jio calling app. But overall its superb. Sound, 180 degree rotatable camera, 2 gb ram all working very fine. I think it was an excellent buy from me. \ud83d\udc9f",
            "I am sharing this review after 1 week usage. The tablet is a beast. It is exactly as shown in the picture . 3 major X factor of this tablet is, sound effect with dolby atmos , rotating camera with good picture quality & rotating stand. No any pros seen so far . If u are looking for tablet in 16k range don't think of any other brand . Just go for it and u will never regret.",
            "After using this for 2 weeks I feel this product is amazing. 100% satisfaction guaranteed. Sleek and stylish with rotating camera. Good battery and camera. Handle it delicately for long run. The only compromising point is....there is no dual camera. But rotating experience is better than it. Hats off for the person who designed it.",
            "Beautiful, Value for money Tab.Good for reading,camera takes decent quality pics, the stand makes it adaptable to many situations. Battery back up is the best among the competition. Only downside is the weight.Its heavy. Wish Lenovo gives the tab a Marshmellow update.Overall, a great all rounder.",

            "The world's your stylus!\nExcellent tab! Very flexible. I am writing this review after using it for two years. Battery backup, sound, display everything is awesome. However, the most interesting feature I think is the Any Pen Technology. It means you can use any thing as your stylus as long as the tip is metallic - Forks, graphite pencil, pen or even paper clips! And yes you can use those to scribble notes as well in your tab - a similar feature provided by others under different names but expensive technologies. Although usage of any pen is good for operating the tab/scribbling. Not good for serious painting etc. The supporting yoga stand is very helpful too!",
            "Really awesome product worth of money. This product helped my mom to her daily browse, YouTube videos and WhatsApp video calling. The main reason I brought this product is for user friendliness for an aged person like my mom. Really it helps her and helped me to ride off my worries to stay with her helping to access PC. Thanks lenova and as usual thanks for Flipkart for time delivery and quality products maintenance",
            "This Tab is amazingly designed easy to carry even in hand. Just that the ram and internal storage is less but still does the job well enough. Camera isn't good. Sound is nice. Display is nice. Touch is smooth. Battery backup is awesome. I charge after 2 or 3 days with normal use. Lenovo should provide its cover and screen guard along with it and a more powerfull charger. I use my moto's turbo charger though.",
            "it s awesome. but im disappointed that voice is heard in the out speaker when we make voice calls. it is designed like a mini laptop. we cannot talk over voice calls in public without using headsets. other than that battery backup camera clarity for reading are good enough",

But it lags. Performance is not so good due to old and weak processor.Its camera is good enough for a tab. Sometimes it lags frequently. Overall it's good device for entertainment purposes live watching movies, reading ebooks, listening music, web browsing ,etc but not for heavy tasks.",

Its special feature is its battery back up, but it takes too much time to charge...It doesn't support volte,so u hv to use jio calling app to make call..Other 4g sims works flawlessly..It simply upgraded to 6.0.1 version..Its metal stand is superb....bt I fl one prblm if u make call holding this tab on hand then its difficult to make call as it has no separately calling speaker, u hv u hear it from loud speaker..though the speakers sound is fabulous, its dolby atmos..\nOverall you can buy this tab if you use it in normal purpose.",
            "Pros:\nLove the design of the product with the kickstand. Can hold it like a book, use as a keyboard, very good for video calls and the rotor camera helps. The screen is a good size and hardware build quality excellent. My only design flaw would be the size of the 'button to eject the kickstand'. It's hard to press, as the kickstand needs to open towards your finger as you press it.\nGood enough battery life. Lasts two days with moderate use at home.\n\nCons: 2GB RAM which seems sufficient is very less. The UI was slow to respond from day 1.\nScreen resolution isn't the best for the cost out there.\nSpeaker loudness is moderate.\n\nNot the best product out there but worth the cost.

            "Good tablet to work on.. It's stylish and handy",
            "It was bought to offer gift to someone, it is to mention that the Tab itself is defective (it's stand is loose) and Jio sim doesn't working on it (It is mention in product specifications by Flipkart and I read in review also that Jio SIM works in it). I think Flipkart bluffing customer, it may highly possible that few of people get Good Condition Tab and larger may get with some defects.\nI am not satisfied with this deal.",
            "Lenovo Yoga 3 tab has high precision touch sensitivity to ball pens of more than 0.7 mm tip.This makes it easy to make notes and emails....\n\nThere is no \"double touch screen on\" feature which I feels as a drawback. The tablet feels heavy ,might be due to the presence of metalic stand. But it defenitely serves its purpose. It does not have a flashlight. Camera is rotatable which is an advantage .Clarity is good.\n\nDisplay and dolby sound are excellent.",

Now I want to sell it.",
            "Nice and compatible for students as well as who are preparing for any exams or job interview as well. Thank you",
            "Good Tab to own,using it for 3 days now.processor is reasonably fast,screen resolution is good.camera is average.Sound quality is awesome.,thanks to dolby atmos system.os is not upgradable most likely.it is 6.0.1 at present.I recommend to buy this tab, its worth for every penny ypu pay.",
            "Simply put, the Yoga Tab 3 8 inch (2GB RAM variant) is a very good tablet at this price point.\n\nWhile there is the 1GB RAM variant available at a lower price on other e-Retailers, I would never recommend that as 2GB RAM is the bare minimum needed for this tablet to run without any hitches.\n\nPROS:\n\nFirst and foremost, there is the unique design with the cylindrical bulge at the side (or bottom depending upon the orientation you choose to hold it in)which is a very handy thing, once you get used to it. It gives you the ability to hold it comfortably in your hand, akin to holding a book by its binding.\n\nIt also houses a rotating camera, which is very cool, for it does away with the need for having separate front & rear facing cameras.\n\nThe integrated kick-stand is another useful thing, for it allows you to place the tablet on any flat surface, without having to rely on any external case or props.\n\nThen, there is this excellent build quality. It's not among the lightest, but there is a reassuring heft to it, and it definitely doesn't feel plasticky or cheap.\n\nThe highlight of this tablet has to be it's exceptional battery life. On moderate to average use, the battery easily lasts for 3 days!\n\nThe display, at 1200 x 800 is not Full HD, but is very bright, and certainly acceptable given that the screen is only 8 inches. In fact, the display on this is better than the 10 inch variant of the Yoga Tab 3, since that also has the same 1200 x 800 resolution.\n\nThe next best feature of this tablet is the exceptionally good sound quality. These are Dolby Atmos speakers, and they certainly sound good, when watching movies or music videos. Also, the speakers are really well designed, and the machine-drilled fine holes for the speakers on cylinder exude a premium look, quite similar to the speaker grille design on the HTC One series of phones.\n\nContrary to the specifications published here on Flipkart, this variant now ships with Android 6.0 from the factory, so you need worry about having to upgrade from Lollipop to Marshmallow. Also, thankfully it doesn't come with as much bloatware now, as the older models used to ship with.\n\nCONS:\n\nPerformance, though definitely better than the 1GB RAM variant, is still below par. Lenovo cleverly masks the fact that this uses a very basic Snapdragon 212 processor, by using the other name for it - MSM8909.\n\nSince it's running a near stock version of Android 6.0, most day-to-day operations will seem OK to the casual user. However, the weakness of the extremely low-end Snapdragon 200-series processor starts coming to the fore, when you see the amount of time it takes to install apps from the Google Play Store. It just takes far too long to download & install updates, when compared to even the most entry level smart phones.\n\nIf only Lenovo had equipped this with a Snapdragon 400-series processor - even if it were for a couple of thousand bucks more!\n\nAnother area of weakness is the camera. While the swivel camera is a great (and very handy) design element, the camera consistently gives sub-par picture quality, and definitely doesn't make the cut in today's era. However, how many of us actually use a tablet to take pictures outdoors?\n\nDespite the somewhat mediocre performance, and a sub-par camera, it still remains a very choice for it's superb build quality, battery life, and display - more so at the discounted price that it's available for during sales!",

With the season of 4gb & 2ghz clocks in Vogue now..this tab does a decent job in coping up with speeds..but stutters upon demanding too much. Multi tasking has oflate become lazier..and main thing is the battery backup is good..but taking more and more time to charge to full by the day..I shouldn't complain as it was never meant for ultra fast zooming about but still it has the reputation of a good budget tablet worth buying, especially for:\nLooks\nBattery\nErgonomics (kick stand built in)\nGood processing speed\nAGAINST:\nMemory\nMulti tasking\nCharge speed (with ageing)",

And the other is the camera, the camera is you know okay, tablets aren't really supposed to have brilliant cameras, but still Lenovo could have done better.\n\nOther than that this is a beast, play games, use stereo speakers its just really good.\n\nHighly recommended product for people who need something bigger than a cellphone on the go to get things done.",

            "The product is good. Improvements needed in the area of processor. Any pen tech works fine. It's too sensitive, there must be option to reduce it. Gaming experience is also fine. There were no details of protective glasses. If comes with Corning Gorilla glass it would be fine. I'd give 7 star. Improvements needed for camera, it's always trying to focus. Other than that quality of pic is good. If ear phone is given it'd be nice. Paying so much amount and not getting desired accessories is painful experience. Battery is good",

Then I bought it.\n\nHere is my review & experience with this tab..\n\nPros:\n\n1) As I mentioned earlier, look is awesome guys..\n2) Sound quality is mind blowing. I have been using HTC mobile & I thought it has great speaker sound quality but this tab beats the HTC.\n3) Internal storage okay.\n4) Touch smooth good.\n5) 180\u00b0 camera taking decent pictures. But in dark places, photos are not good. If you take in daylight, it works perfect.\n6) Speed is good...no sticking issues while playing High graphics car games, browsing, watching YouTube videos, movies etc.\n\nCons\n1) Sometimes volume button doesn't work. It automatically works later. (My experience only)\n2) Wallpaper will not fit automatically. Horizontal photo won't suit when we use tab vertically.\n3) Some what heating but it's common for every device\n\nMy final words: Guys! Go for it. You won't regret.\nThanks!",
            "Awesome tablet with best battery backup no hanging problem superb design of body world first this type of tab u can also use it stand and hang, I like mostly jio 4g support .",
            "I Am rigrarously using this tablet for gaming , internet (Reliance jio), voice calls and various social networkings softwares including Facebook for the past ten days , I would like to place my experience and findings in the form of PROS & CONS ,\n\nPros.\n1. No lagging even while using high end games\n2. 2GB RAM is relatively speed enough for my needs\n3. Screen size is good to view even from 1.5 MTR long\n4. Internal storage (16GB) is enough for me store both officil and personal data and can be extended to 128 GB through external storage\n5. Steel stand is comfortable and can be used either as wall mounted or desktop\n6. Revolving camera is really innovative\n7. Good look and classical coating\n8. Processor speed and clock speed is satisfactory\n\nCons.\n1. No accessories including screen guard were not provided\n2. At this cost RAM should be 3GB but for me it is ok\n3. At this cost screen resolution should be little bit higher\n4. Heating issues are there after continuous 1 hour use but negligible only\n5. Power is drastically draining while using net and consuming little bit more time for charging , since I have not used while roaming I cannot comment more\n\nBut my final suggestion is GOFOR IT because in order to eliminate these minor CONS , you have to opt for higher cost mobiles in the name of reputed Brand",

One must get the screen guarded after buying it.\n- Camera is far away from the screen.\n- Any pen stylus may scratch the screen without guard.\n- *No upgrade from Marshmallow to higher OS.\n- No 3/32gb and 4/64 gb variants.\n- Price hasn't fallen since many years.\n\nNonetheless, a good tablet. Go for it.",

Earlier it was 1Amps\nExcellent build quality\n8MB camera - can be used for Skype etc. not many use tabs for taking pics so one camera is enough.

More as the days pass. However there can be one more help by tie ups with case and keyboad manufactures for display of their wares specifically for the use of YOGA 3 and also any other if matched. Today it is other brands displayed with hardly any auto selection mode for the YOGA 3 brand.\n\nAnyways Cheers",
            "I had been following this tab for quite a while, waiting for the price to drop. And during the flipkart big billion day sale, the price drastically came down. That along with the SBI card offer, I got the tab for a total of 11691Rs. Thanks to flipkart n SBI for that.\n\nNow, coming to the tab..\nThis is my first tablet.\nI was interested in the tab mainly due to the battery capacity. The 6200 MAh lasts for more than 3days for my average use.\nThe tab is very nice for reading and with the hold mode on, the light is also conveniently adjusted.\nCamera is really great in during day... Couldn't try it at night( absence of flash).\n\n2GB ram works fine.. played asphalt 8 in the tab. Worked well except for the fact that it took some time to load.

            "I bought lenova tab on 02-05-2017 thro' flipcart but exactly after the expiry of one year warranty period i.e. on 02-05-2018, the tab suddenly stopped functioning. The charging completely failed and to make the matters worst , three software problems also got developed on the tab. When I took the tab to the authorised servicing centre viz. M/s Rocky Agencies, Chennai they concluded that the mother board had totally failed . They demanded a huge amount of Rs.9500/- to replace it. I was totally surprised and shocked. I was spellbound and did not get it repaired by them.\nOther service agencies, when approached informed that the spare part concerned was nowhere available. This is the true condition of the tab at present and I am totally vexed.\n\nWhat is the problem with flipcart? I find there is no need for me to edit my text . Facts have been mentioned to the point. That is all. If either flipcart or lenovo could do something on this problem and resolve it, it is well and good. Otherwise leave it. Let flipcart try to save its image and avoid becoming FLOPCART in my case.\n\nHow dare you term my bad experiences with the tablet as rubbish? I am least bothered about your norms and rules. I have paid thro' my nose and no power on earth could stop me from commenting.Instead of regretting , you are talking indifferently. Very sorry state of affairs. I have decided to stop further deals with your company and would advice my friends and relatives as well to follow my suit. An expensive and very bad experience for me indeed.-- Narayanan",

On YouTube, videos stops automatically and sometimes it's almost 6 times in a 3min video. Video on YouTube are stopping when you keep this in you hand.\nThe chrome does not work properly.\nAnd the worst part is its tethering feature. It automatically changes its name and remove the security features.\nThe tab locks itself automatically.\n\nWorst of all these things is, the so called service they provide at the service centre. First time they keep your tab and after listening with a deaf ear, the only thing they do is update your software and give it you after one day. Again you go and they do some setting change and ask you to check the problem in 5 min. And then again you go and they will keep it for 18 days and within half and hour of receiving your tab you start confronting the same problems.\nThe worst electronic ever.",

Pause and play option always comes up on screen and video background become dark when you touch edge of tablet or put your finger just above screen.

I don't know about others but i can't read policy every time before buying product.",

It still had a WiFi problem despite it's supposedly extensive quality checks and was once again given back for repair. Now the service centre can't fit back the open piece and is sending it to Bangalore for repair. 3 months for a tablet. They cannot replace the faulty piece with a new one not are they willing to refund. This character named Abijit Dash who is Lenovo rep is really pathetic and the company after sales is worse. Don't buy Lenovo. Poor quality and even poor after sales",

            "Terrible! I'm writing this review after 1 month usage. This device has lot of software issues. You can see it right after starting the device as it takes around 2gb of software update even though device was manufactured in March 17.But it would be apt to say that it was an another failed attempt by Lenovo engineers on maintaining the device bug free.\n\nOn the second day the device suddenly stopped working and showed 'system ui stopped working unfortunately' everytime I restart. So I had to factory reset the device on second day.\n\nThis device has also problems when coming to Bluetooth connectivity and micro SD card function. I lost my data on microSD and whenever it is connected it shows as a portable storage connected.\n\nThe only plus would be dolby atmos and sensitive touch along with an average battery life.",

            "What an amazing Tablet. I bought this on Double Billion days offer. The product cost was MRP: 19000/-. But as a promotional item I bought it around Rs. 13,000/- approx. It's a bingo for me. The Tablet design is fantastic. 180* camera rotation with maximum 8 megapixel camera. It's very user friendly. I can use it as Laptop also. I need not carry my 15'.6\" Dell laptop now. Lot's of things can be done through this model. Delivery time, (even during the huge congestion time) , they delivered so quickly within 2-3 days... Battery and Digital Dolby sound are soon good. I didn't found any cons till date.",
            "Product is really great for this package! Feature is too good !\nOnly drawback is its litte bit heavy to use in hands for long time.... But stand helps to overcome that drwaback....\n180' rotating camera feature is awesome...",
            "Beautiful product, it's a steal deal for 10800/- when outside it's retailing at 16000/-. Worth picking it. One draw back though is that while unmounting otg usb drive it makes those Apps which are present in the Sd card to disappear and they reappear only after restarting the system( because the system has a glitch Of unmounting the Sd card also though it doesn't show as unmounted). If u are using otg then remove the USB stick directly without unmounting , then it doesn't let apps loaded in Sd card to disappear.",
            "Excellent build... Battery backup is excellent... Can watch 3 movies on a single stretch.. If used for reading and browsing , it can last for two days easily.. Internet videos can drain the battery quickly. Not the best for gaming. Ram management could have been better.",

            "This is not a product review, have no issues with it. Flipkart not allowing me to review at the Samsung F22 page which got delivered today. Flipkart delivery time period as always is above par. However I am terribly DISAPPOINTED with their exchange policy. I bought Samsung F22 for exchange of my existing Asus Zenphone Max Pro 1 and the exchange value shown was Rs 3800.00 subject to minimum working conditions. When the delivery guy came, he checked all the parameters and it was found up to the mark but as if to find some faults deliberately, he showed me a tiny spot in the screen which I also did not notice as I am using this phone with no issues. In fact, I was to do a factory reset only after the new phone arrives as it is currently my working phone. There are 2 ways to look at it . Either the delivery guy has clear directions of not paying the entire agreed cost of exchange as it appeared to be pre-decided OR the second reason is he has no idea of what is checking. This is even dangerous as the reputation of mighty Company like Flipkart is in hands of such guys. I have never ever posted any negative reviews but I feel cheated and disappointed this time. I did read reviews that Flipkart has very poor exchange policy but did not believe and went ahead as my experience about buying new product is totally different. In the end I paid heavy price for blind trust. Lessons learnt. For all guys out there, if you want to buy a new phone with no exchange go ahead but DO NOT fall into the lucrative exchange prices. Does Flipkart expect us to exchange brand new phone with absolutely no minor scratches or issues? Wish they had better insight and had option of judgement of the exchange product by some expert than some pretty ordinary guy.",

And if you are in AC ,metal turn so cold that it is difficult to hold it in hand.

But it do not give a standby of even two days with Jio sim.\n\nIf you are going for this price go for some better brand. Lenovo proved once more that it's just another Chinese company.\n\nAfter using 4 years I can see it might be overpriced. But still working good. And it a lifeline during lockdown.",

One weird thing is that even a soft brush of any cloth over the screen...selects random app or function. Really frustrating.\nI mean you are spending a great deal on this device and Lenovo just wants your money. the same goes for it phones also.\nBut coming back to the device, it should be priced below 14 k for what Lenovo is deliberately making.",

            "Ordered it on 26th october and got on 31st, so a satisfying delivery by flipkart. Since I am using it for almost 1 month, I am noting down those facts and issues about the tablet that I have experienced without any exaggeration.\nPositive points:-\n1. Played youtube videos with the official YouTube app by Google, and it took about 7 hours to discharge the battery from 97% to 21%.\n2. Read pdfs continuously for 5 hours with XODO reader, battery went from 78% to about 56%.\n3. Surfed internet(Facebook + The Hindu web + Gmail + Google search), it took 3 hours to discharge from 82% to 63%.\n4. Played World Cricket Championship 2 by NextWave Multimedia, and in about 3 hours battery discharged from 89% to 41%.\n5. Played Special Forces Group 2 by ForgeGames and it drained battery from 90% to 54% in an hour.\nBut what I need to mention here is I didn't installed battery draining apps like I) Facebook, II) WhatsApp, III)IMO, Even I am writing this review after installing Flipkart app minutes ago.\n6. The tab is very easy to handle, as it's CG is towards the side of the kickstand, chances are low that you will drop it from hand providing you held it by the kickstand's side.\n7. ppi of the screen is less than 200, but still 720p videos on youtube looks enough detailed.\n8. Dolby Atmos makes the sound quality very classy. It feels like I am in a mini-theatre when I watch a cinema.\n9. Once I dropped it totally bare(without screen guard or cover) from my hand by the side of the screen from about 6 inch above floor, still I only noticed very negligible scratches it made.\n10. Once I fully charged it and just didn't use for about 12 hours. On unlocking the screen, all I noticed was the battery status which was stating that it has 99% battery left.\nNow time for Negetive points:-\n1. If multitasked for long time, battery heats up to 35\u2103, as shown by 360 security app.\n2. It runs a Snapdragon 210 processor which sometimes make it hang a-bit, even if it has 2 Gigs of RAM.\n3. 720p videos in YouTube some times run laggy.\n4. When I charge this tablet keeping it on(not power off), it becomes heated up after charging for about 2 hours. But when charged keeping the power off, this issue get eliminated.\n5. Although it is 4G enabled, this doesn't have the VoLTE( Voice over LTE) technology. So if you use a a connection like Reliance JIO which is totally 4G band based, you won't be able to call or message anyone with tablet's default keypad or messaging app. But you can do this with Jio4GVoice(previously JioJoin) in case of Reliance Jio connection, which require you to have your mobile data on while calling or messaging others.\n6. Though the camera of this tablet is tagged 8 MP, it would disappoint you if you loves to take pictures(not me), but does well job while video calling.\n\nLast line:- Lenovo Yoga Tab 3 - 850M with 4G and 2 GB RAM is for those, who 1) loves to read a lot, may be offline or online,(Amazon Kindle app designed for tablets works well), 2) Draw or Write digitally(don't forget about AnyPen technology, it works with every sharp end conducting material), 3)Happy with low end games, 4) Wants to enjoy a whole night watching movie online, 5)Want to have an almost stock like Interface, 6) Love to surf the web and new blogs, websites every now and then.\nSome suggestions from me:-\n1. It comes with MacAfee antivirus with 1 months free subscription. You better uninstall it and use 360 antivirus(free), because MacAfee sometimes makes it slow while protecting web.\n2. Have a screen protector which is \"Matte\" otherwise light may refelect of the screen a lot during day time, making it a bit harder to carry on reading PDFs with it.\n3. Using a cover on it may protect it physically, but it is designed in such a way the handling it with a cover makes it feel heavier. So my suggestion is instead of using a frame like cover, use a bag like case, so when you carry it , you keep it safely inside the case, and when you want to use it, take it out and use. It will make you handle it easier.\n\nIt's all I have experienced. Now decision is yours. Have a good BUY.\nUpdate: It's been more than 4 months of use and I wanna add some points here.\nI) I've tried many games in past 2 months, and I have to admit that despite having a Snapdragon 210 this tablet provides pretty impressive performance. Most of the games(Oddworld:Strangers wrath, Star Wars:KOTOR, N.O.V.A.3, ShadowGun deadzone, Bullet force, Modern strike, Critical Ops, XCOM:Enemy within, GTA:CTW) runs well,really well. But games like GTA:SA & VC , MC5:Blackout dropped framerate, giving me a bad experience. They are playable with sacrificed graphics(Not MC5).\nII) I am constantly facing a brightness problem now a days. When at night I read something with brightness kept lowest, suddenly it automatically goes high(I always set brightness manually), making my eyes pissed off. Same thing happens at daytime, when brightness automatically goes down making me annoyed. Though it seldom happens, still irritating.",
            "-2 stars\n- Data via jio sim constantly fluctuates making calling via jio4gvoice app completely impossible, even a coolpad note 3 lite does a better job in consistancy\n\n+3 stars\n- Amazing sound quality/clearity & loudness, i cancelled my bluetooth speakers's order after listening to these speakers.\n- Good battery life\n- Good build quality\n\nAverage camera and display resolution, i don't mean they are bad but they are not the best or eyecatching i would say. And i was surprised by consistent updates by Lenovo, wasn't expecting that. Upgrade your device till the latest update (marshmallow 1 march security patch) and then sign your google account to make sure everything goes smooth. Overall its a deadly combo of good speakers, battery life and a big screen. If you can live without jio in this device then its for you.\nAnd the charger provided charges the tab at 1500 milliamp, takes about 3 hours to charge, which isnt bad considering the mammoth battery",
            "Bought this beauty after several days of research, reviewing lot reviews and I am bang on choosing this one. A super cool and perfect tab for daily use, battery life is great. Thanks to Flipkart for replacing swiftly.",
            "Timely delivery, good packaging, great value for money\nDisplay screen could have been better for this range to be the top contender",
            "First of all, thank you Flipkart for delivering the product so quickly (Three Days), even though i stay in a remote area. I am very happy with the tablet. RAM is 2 GB as mentioned and battery backup is wonderful. 3 days of continuous usage without charging. I have updated it to Marshmallow and it is now part and parcel of my digital life. Lenovo does what it says. It is a very useful to those that want a second device, apart from their laptop. Once again thank you Flipkart and thanks to the delivery team for their wonderful efforts to make customers happy.",
            "I bought this tab with high expectation and when I received I was happy with look and specification. But on next day I found unable to draw security lock properly and my touch screen is not working. I placed replacement with flipkart they called me next day and told will send technician for checking but till then for 5 days(still waiting) no communication from flipkart. everytime I call then they give another 24/48 hr deadline.\n\nNOT EXPECTED THIS SERVICE FROM BRAND LIKE FLIPKART.now I am thinking whether seller TBL is flipkart exclusive or not. #dissapointed\n\nAfter several escalation my replacement request accepted and thankfully within 2 days new item delivered.",
            "Bought this product on independence day. It has all features such as rotating camera (both front and back), adjustable resting stand that can be used for hands free use and viewing at angles, long lasting battery at least 2 days almost for moderate use, upgraded to Marshmallow, 2 GB RAM (important), two stereo speakers with good volume and dolby sound and finally jio sim working flawlessly (voice calling and internet). Grant permission for all apps in settings to work flawlessly. It has screen of 8 inch IPS screen with any pen use technology in which you can use even pencil for touch response. These features are rare to find in other tablets. Only negative side is its weight but one can tolerate for long lasting battery and camera could have been better even though acceptable for tab. I purchased a nice cover and screen guard which are really useful. I use Nova launcher to get smooth experience. Overall it is a nice product.",

            "i give it 4 Stars for Tab.\n\nits an awesome product been using it since 1 week , havent really used it much, build quality could have ben better near the battery (i feel its a bit loose, it shakey).

            "i'm giving it 1star cuz of the poor customer service by lenovo,i bought this tablet in June 2016.the tablet is ok considering the price but i accidentally ended up breaking the LCD screen(not the touch but the LCD inside,which by the way breaks very easily) and when i went to the service center they told that they don't cover it in warranty,and that i would have to pay 10000 rupees to get a new LCD screen.i bought this tablet for Rs16999 ,so thats more than half of the price of the tablet.and same day there was this another guy at service center with his yoga tab which he had bought in Feb,and he was having software issue with it,and they told him that if there is a problem with the motherboard of the tablet he'll have to pay 10000 for the motherboard to get it replaced.so i thought even if i pay 10000 rupees ,what is the guarantee i'll not face any issue with tablet again?so i thought to get a new LCD from the local market.now here is the catch ,these tabs are sold only online and so is not going to be a single shop who will keep its parts. i bought this tab after reading the awesome review it has but i regret it now,if had bought an iPad i would have got much better customer service with accidental coverage.this is were brand matters.",
