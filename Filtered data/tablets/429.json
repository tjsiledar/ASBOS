            "Alcatel PIXI 4 (7) Wifi tablet is good. It functions very well. Processor speed is good. The company provides screen guard with the tablet. Once it is sticked with the guard. The tablet screen looks normal. HD videos play very much good on it. The tablet is thinner and smaller comparing to same range tabets by other brands. The cons of the tablet is that its cover is not available in the market.",

Since we can open multiple normal applications simultaneously.\nCamera is not good in this device.\nScreen clarity is normal becauseIt resolution is not Full HD.",

            "I wanted to buy a budget tablet from a standard company so i selected Alcatel.I got it on 18th of july .The delivery by flipkart was very prompt and i am fully satisfied with the product.The touch functions very well...better than i expected in a tab worth 4k,the screen resolution is also not bad.We shd put aside the cameras in this one.The sound output is also quite ordinary, Overall the product is quite decent and working without any glitches. It is a good one to give into the hands of children also because it dosent have a sim -just stop the data usage and no radiation.secondly it is not expensive.I loaded photos and videos taken with a DSLR camera which are opening very smoothly. Only one difference i found is that the inbuilt memory is only 4gb whereas on flipkart it was stated as 8gb.",
            "Great Product and a clear winner for this price point! Will surely recommend if they maintain the discounts :) Keep up alcatel!",
            "For a product that costs less than \u20b94000 , this is a wonderful deal. The touch screen sensitivity is manageable and it's been 2 days since the day of purchase ,the device is yet to lag. It is perfect for watching videos and stuff, low weight games and reading. If you need a low to mediocre usage device, go for it.",
            "Best tab under 4000 rs but the battery should have some power so we do not need to charge 2 or 3 times a day but it is the best tab in this price range. But its very good in RAM optimizing.Good\u270c.",

To watch videos if have to look straight to the screen little tilt will make the video darkar. Battery backup is good. In one full charge you can use it for upto 5 -6 hours fir reading.
