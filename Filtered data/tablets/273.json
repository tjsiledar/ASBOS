            "Shared my initial review below.\n\nPros:\n\n1. With the provided RAM and processor, it is fast. The applications, games, songs and videos are loading smooth\n2. Pure android, so new bloat wares! This is really good for the given configuration.\n3. As this tablet is meant for kid, it has an option as to when to start and when to shut down in the Settings. So you can habituate your kid to use only for stipulated time only\n4. Screen is decent. You should not expect high resolution as it is only 1024 X 600. So the screen is good when viewed from half a feet distance\n5. Battery stays for a long also charging takes a max of 3 hours to fully charge the 3450mAh battery. I have ASUS turbo charger for my phone. I tried that as well and the charging takes 2 hours to fully charge\n6. No heating when playing games, watching video, playing music in full volume which is big plus!\n\nCons:\n\n1. Screen is not sharp. It\u2019s smudgy because of the resolution and ppi. Its only 1024 X 600 with 179ppi\n2. Expected the \"Restart\" button to restart the tablet, rather it shuts down. With repeated attempts, I confirmed this\n3. Touch sensitivity is a bit lagging. Tried to close the Chrome browser tab and it was unresponsive\n4. Swiping (from right to left) and closing the Google Now cards takes a bit of time. Not that fluidic\n5. Reading photos from SD card takes more time. I mounted one of my 2GB cards and was trying to open a picture, it was slow a bit\n6. Booting the tablet takes nearly a minute.\n7. Marshmallow update is not there for this tablet as opposed to the spec given in the Spec sheet.\n8. Accessories like cases / covers are very expensive in the web stores. There is no appropriate cases available yet. And the same goes with Tempered Glass. So it\u2019s up to you to handle it carefully\n\nConclusion\n\n1. I initially though thru Micromax P680, iBall, Swipe, Lenovo Tab2 series and all and finally purchased this.\n2. If you are gifting this to your kid, I would strongly recommend this as for 5000/- the tablet serves its purpose diligently. Can't expect more from this device.\n\nI am happy with the Prompt FlipKart delivery. Ordered on Friday and got it delivered yesterday!",
            "Why can't I have a peace of mind while buying product from Flipkart? Why it's becoming a fact that whenever any electronic Item (specially mobile devices) is bought online from Flipkart is turned to be somehow faulty? Do you source from some special vendor who always supply faulty product?\n\nLast time I bought a Micromax product and within 3 months it started having issue, ultimately after 1 year 2 months time, I had to throw out that phone. This time I bought a Lenovo Tab3 7 inch.\n#1. The charger, is not working since, I have opened it, the charger did not work once at least. Thanks god, I had a old charger fro which I can charge the device to use it.\n#2. While Talking in phone mode using that Tab, voice reach very low on the other end. So on this end. Even with highest volume.\n\nSince, it was a gift to my nephew on his excellent result in his exam, I am in no state to take that out from him and return that to Flipkart. Why do I always need to take the product to a service center even if it's a new one? WHY?\n\nBe very cautious before buying it on Flipkart. Don't know about others.",
            "I'm write review after using 5 month experience. This tab performance is really good nd their is no issue of lagging when ever you play high graphics games or using whole day like watching movies, listening songs etc. I'm buy this tab for e-learning and I realize lenovo doing a good on it. All the things are much much better than others so I'll give 5 star. Thanx flipkart",
            "Thanks flipkart. I received my tablet within the day mentioned. I'm extremely satisfied with it. No issues. No lags. It's android 5.0, not bulky. Feels light. No bloatwares pre-installed except 2 lenovo apps. Camera isn't that great, you can't expect anything more at this price point. Only 8GB internal storage, out of that you get only roughly around 3GB for apps. Android is not upgradeable, eventhough i won't update it because upgrading new version causes tablet to lag after that. Newer versions android 5.1 onwards need minimum 1.5GB RAM for smooth performance. Display isn't bad. Bright and vivid. But only problem when you change it to landscape mode, it shows pixelation due to low dpi. Battery is great, gives me 6 hours of screen on time till 50%. For complete discharge gives 9 hours of screen on time, which is exceptional with wifi on. Speakers aren't that loud. Internal DAC is not that good. Got it's MAC vendor is motorola, expecting it is made by motorola parts. LOL.. !! Overall i love it and recommend this lenovo tablet.",
            "Great tab, for this value its worth. Battery back up is good, good sound quality, picture quality is good, camera is good compare to another one. I really like the product",
            "After 1day use= flipkrt is soo good, this tab is best for reading books, in other section like browsing watching movie camera games u will b disappointed eventually..it serves my reading purpose well so i'm enjoying the tab",
            "dis tab is just awesome for its performance according to its price.its 3g wifi is great.it has fast & good net browsing with good display resolution.Good speed ...good software......",
            "The smart blue margin around the ebony black body looks very nice, light and thin as well. Touch screen working pretty good without a guard. The picture quality with the main back camera is quite decent in natural light, I don't bother with the front camera that much. The tab has the good feel of a good make (Lenovo) so don't bother to go for the cheaper ones which promise you this config at 2K-3K. Your money will go down the drain. This is a very fair price to pay for this config. This is not meant for heavy use, as the 3450 mAH battery needs charging after continuous use of about 3 hours. The 1 GB RAM and processor takes care of all normal needs from the internet like banking, e-shopping, mailing, site surfing, social networking etc. My 8 year daughter is very happy with the looks and also her purpose of downloading and playing games from the internet and sometimes listening to You Tube is more than fulfilled. You can go for the 16GB, 4G model with a larger battery if you need it. Very satisfied with the Lenovo tab.",

            "OK Fine Now Guys Writing this review after 11months of tab use so I will\ndivide my review in pros and con's:-\nPROS:-\n1.Even though the ram provided is less the tab doesn't hang up.\n2. Battery life is a bit good as compared to other tablets in this range.\n3. Display quality is good but would have been better.\n4. As there is no sim slot the in built Wi-Fi is of top notch quality even catches low range Wi-Fi without any problem.\n5. Speaker quality is just awesome, and the volume can go really high.\nCon's:-\n1. Difficulty in getting the accessories for tab as the one available in the Indian market is very very costly, so I ordered the back cover and tempered glass from aliexpress.\n2. Flipkart claims that the tab will receive marshmallow update but it is not.\n3. The android version on the tab is very unstable, doesn't have file manager out of the box, the lenovo UI just sucks on the tab.\n4. Camera quality is very cheap, even considering the price range there are other Chinese tab manufactures that give better camera quality at the same price range.\n5. Lots of time the chrome browser becomes non response, the open tabs in the browser doesn't close.\n6. Problem with external memory card, always you have to grant the permission for external memory card, and while downloading on utorrent or any other client when you choose directory as external SD card the torrent file downloading shows error.\n7. Many apps on Google play store are not supported on tab such as WhatsApp,etc.\n8. When we change our wallpaper using any photo or the apps the wallpaper switches to the custom wallpaper within few seconds.\n9. Sometimes due to heavy usage the tab shut down on its own and enters boot mode and switches on after 5mins.\n10. When we connect the tab to the computer via USB cable it just shows the SD card and do not show the internal memory on PC.\n11. Out of 8GB we get only 4.9GB and this is not sufficient as after updating apps from play store almost 1.5GB is used up and also installing the few important apps such as file manager which doors not come preloaded and few other you are usually left with 2.5GB and that is not sufficient for downloading a movie of 1080p or installing a game.\n12. Guys never try to run a 1080p movie because no use the screen quality is just 1280\u00d7600.\n13. The touch pad is not scratch resistance and will get scratches very fast even using it lightly so screen guard and tempered glass is necessary.\n\n\nThere are many more cons but the review will become too big. So guys buying this device today will be just wasting our money, this device is just good for reading books.\nAs flipkart is giving huge discounts in the tab I feel that no one should purchase this tab in late 2017 where there are many other brands which give better quality than this lenovo tab. I GOT THIS DEVICE FOR 4,799.\n\n\nTHANK YOU.",
            "yes I know this is not a very good tablet for everyday use in a manner of ease but its a fantastic tablet for teenagers or youngsters for playing game and surfing internet and doing multitasking also in a good budget that pocket friendly. Matte finished back panel that helps you to drop the device very often, sleek design with dolby digital sound(in headphone or speaker). But one thing the screen resolution and ppi is not impressive. After all this device is fine to use and yes the Ekart delivery is 5star... its delivered my tablet within two days!",
            "I was expecting a good product from Lenovo but they somewhat disappointed me when i received the product. The tablet is build with a cheap quality plastic and they didn't even provide me a screen protector with it. Anyway, These things weren't a big for me but the battery life was. It wasn't not giving me a stand by time more than 5 hours. The processor starts giving hiccups when you try to install Google Launcher on it. Speak quality wasn't good aswell.\n\nI had a word with Flipkart about it and they refunded me back the money, I might wait for a good tablet now.\n\nPS: It's a okay tablet if you don't want to play games, Facebook, Twitter.",
            "Mind blowing tab in this price. HD videos look excellent. Display is great in 170 ppi. I have not found even a single defect. Everything is working perfectly.

Large PDF and DJVU textbooks are getting opened (I downloaded EBookDroid for that) in it as if in a computer! The video and image quality of stored videos and images seem pretty good also. Even the camera, for still photography, is quite satisfactory for laymen like me! Hat's off to Lenovo and to FlipKart for this miracle! The only hitch is the absence of a pre-installed file manager (I downloaded and installed both ES File Explorer and 'File Manager' later), the files copied to this tablet appears (yes, connection cable for PC is provided as a part of the charger cable) lost totally within the wilderness! However, a few days later, with downloaded WPS Office (all these four apps are free), I can now read and edit MS Office files also.",
