            "Good tab at low price.\n\nPros-\n1) Good battery backup. 6hrs of continuous use.\n2) hardly any lag. thanks to quad core 1.3Ghz processor and 1G RAM.\n3) upgradable to Android kitkat 4.4.2.\n\nCons-\n1) Screen resolution is very poor. My laptop has same resolution of 1024\u00d7600 but its much more clear and readable than this tab.\n2) Screen is not anti glare. I always see reflection.\n3) Display is not IPS. Viewing angles are bad.\n4) Camera quality is very poor.\n5) Head set mic is not supported in voice call.\n6) Touch is not smooth. sometime It doesn't recognize touch which is irritating.\n\nthis tab is good for this price.\nI bought it for reading books. but i think IPS display and minimum screen resolution of 720p is a must for a tab.\nI read that this tab support 3g dongle but i can't be able to connect my dongle to it.\nplease tell me anyone how to connect 3g dongle to it.",
            "First I should thank flipkart for delivering the product well before delivery time.\n\nThis is a great product for such a price. The look, touch response are awesome. The weight is good and the tab is very handy. just you can hold like a book. Internal memory of 8 GB is one of the key point. Games are working very good, no question of slow / hanging...functioning is very smooth. The camera could have been much better...even though I though 2 mp its fine, the good looks of the tab deserves much better lenses. Very comfortable points for sim, memory card, charging etc.\n\nOverall this is a very good product and if one is looking for tab below 10K, this is the best.\n\nBut dont purchase the case from flipkart, as the suggestions / prompts by the system are totally wrong and you will end up wasting money on the case.",
            "This was my first order from flipkart and i bought the tablet after seeing the same in croma retail outlet. There the tablet looked good and display seems very nice. But the one i got from flipkaret has lines in the display. I mean you can easily see the pixels. Was always skeptical of ordering online and my doubts became reality about them shipping the refurbished or bad products. Part of the reason why their pricing is lower from others. I would request them to send a good product and not the rejected manufacturing units or refurbished ones at lower price. A 1000 rupees more won't hurt for quality. To be honest, now i think there whole pipeline is flooded with such products and due to that only, they are able to sell at a lesser price or may be the quality check needs heads up. Lenovo might be at fault too. Product delivery is great but the product itself wasn't upto the mark.\n\nREVISION: Got a call from flipkart staff about ensuring replacement but i declined as i can live with it. But anyways Good step by their team in the right direction. I have asked them to ensure quality check from lenovo or anywhere else they are fetching their inventory. Hope the next purchase will be swift and fine. Best of luck to flipkart and all.",

            "Pros:\nIf you are looking for a low cost tab for reading books or comics then this product is great, I dont really play games or watch movies on it so i shell not comment on that. Another thing that is great about this product is the battery life. The touch screen works fine and the device looks good.\n\nCons:\nThe biggest problem I have faced with the tab is using the Internet which is a nightmare, Most of the times even though the device is connected to the wifi and the signal is strong it simply wont work and even when it is working it is generally very slow. This is really frustrating. I even tried 2g on this device which is also hopelessly slow. So if you intend to use the wifi this is not for you. Also the tab has crashed twice in the last three months I have been using it.",

No signal issues or lag in connectivity.\n- Battery - Pretty good considering i play games and browse internet for atleast 3 hrs a day.\n- Processor - No lag faced till yet.

            "Good tab at low price.\n\nPros-\n1) Good battery backup. 6hrs of continuous use.\n2) hardly any lag. thanks to quad core 1.3Ghz processor and 1G RAM.\n3) upgradable to Android kitkat 4.4.2.\n\nCons-\n1) Screen resolution is very poor. My laptop has same resolution of 1024\u00d7600 but its much more clear and readable than this tab.\n2) Screen is not anti glare. I always see reflection.\n3) Display is not IPS.

            "First I should thank flipkart for delivering the product well before delivery time.\n\nThis is a great product for such a price. The look, touch response are awesome. The weight is good and the tab is very handy. just you can hold like a book. Internal memory of 8 GB is one of the key point. Games are working very good, no question of slow / hanging...functioning is very smooth. The camera could have been much better...even though I though 2 mp its fine, the good looks of the tab deserves much better lenses. Very comfortable points for sim, memory card, charging etc.\n\nOverall this is a very good product and if one is looking for tab below 10K, this is the best.\n\nBut dont purchase the case from flipkart, as the suggestions / prompts by the system are totally wrong and you will end up wasting money on the case.",
            "This was my first order from flipkart and i bought the tablet after seeing the same in croma retail outlet. There the tablet looked good and display seems very nice. But the one i got from flipkaret has lines in the display. I mean you can easily see the pixels. Was always skeptical of ordering online and my doubts became reality about them shipping the refurbished or bad products. Part of the reason why their pricing is lower from others. I would request them to send a good product and not the rejected manufacturing units or refurbished ones at lower price. A 1000 rupees more won't hurt for quality. To be honest, now i think there whole pipeline is flooded with such products and due to that only, they are able to sell at a lesser price or may be the quality check needs heads up.

            "Great Tab for best price\n\nBought this tab last week. I think this is the best tab under 10000rs. It has simply everything.. You just cant beat it!\n\nTo start with it is light and easy to carry. It has 8 GB storage plus expandable memory slot. The OS comes pre-loaded with Android v. 4.2 upgradable to 4.4.2 OTA. Amazing QUAD CORE speeds, no one else has a quad core at this price\n\nGreat battery life.. last upto 8 to 9 hours. Watched 2 Hindi movies during recent travel on work. Super experience with Dolby sound and good display.\n\nBiggest plus point\u2026 it has Voice calling. So I use it as a backup phone when my smartphone runs out.",

            "Nice tab to own.\n\nPros.\n1.Good sensitivity\n2. Decent sound quality\n3. internet surfing and pdf / e-book reading is a great experience.\n4. good battery quality.\nI am not much of a gamer, so haven't install any games yet, good tab to read, surf internet or watch movie when u r traveling.\n\nCons.\n1. The camera is not so good.\n2. You may have some display problems at the initial stage. for example - the display used to get turned off all by itself multiple times within a time span of 2-3minutes. but after I went to the service center, they updated the android version the tab is running very smooth and absolutely no problems so far.\n\nI don't know if its the best product in its class or not, bt I am pretty much satisfied with its performance. as I mentioned earlier, I am not a gamer, so won't be able to tell u much about the processor capacity, but if you need a better camera quality my suggestion is ..... Buy a proper camera, not necessarily a dslr, but a simple P&S is good enough.",

Dolby is what's making all the difference.\nOtherwise too the tab is well built....looks good...good battery....starts up quick & shuts down quicker. Wish it had a mini HDMI port though.\nThis tab exactly fitted my requirement as a great media player....everything else was secondary.\nGood for listening to Internet radio (for me that's Jazz)...can be connected to a HIFI Amp as well.\nThe price has further dipped since i bought it making it an even more attractive option!\nCheers!",
            "Guys its really a great product at this price range.\nFLIPKART made the delivery just in 16 hours from the time of order. express delivery at free of cost. thanks to flipkart for such a super fast delivery. packing was really safe and good. Thats the main reason i insist everybody to buy product through flipkart alone.\n\nPros:\n# Its has a very good configuration of hardware (quad core with 8 gb in-built) which is very nice and flawless to load tonnes of apps. i loaded 320 apps including high end games like Shadow fight, Thor, iron man 3) its really great performance\n# Great build quality(i keep it in my back pocket and drive bike).\n# This cool guy supports any type of earphones with mic ( i checked with samsung, nokia, sony, etc) its really a cool feature which they didn't mention anywhere.\n# Great sound quality in ear phone and stereo loud speaker too.(note: u can adjust the graphic equalizer and sound environment in DOLBY which gives a great sound experience(Deep bass, good trebel, suround sound, voice and mid range sounds etc) for music lovers. and the sound quality is highly incomparable with any other smart phones available in market now.\n# Great battery standby (8 hours of display on-time) with continuous wifi on. you can watch 3 english movies once u charged it fully.\n# Great 2g internet speed( vodafone, aircel,and docomo too) it gives a considerable speed in 2g itself and so i dont worry for 3g. you will take 10 sec even to connect to edge when u switch on your data on, but this one is really fast in connecting to data. its really great and cool.\n# Great call quality, network is clean and clear( i have checked almost with all the networks)\n# Great value for money. u wont get such a great product in any other company (LENOVO rocks)\n# The KITKAT update for the tab gives a great feel of experience. its so good with lot of features like (USB internet reverse tethering, usb ethernet, satus bar and switching menu all over any tasks, even during games and video it goes full screen and comes back with status bar when we touch the top. its a really great feature of KITKAT which i love the most, full screen caller id as default, voice unlock, etc etc\n\ncons\n# Camera is 2mp and it could be even better. but it does the job clearly. decent photos to share with social networks. and the display could be even better( view angle is not good in one angle)\n# it takes me lot of time to write the review for such a great product, it has so many features which i cant remember and mention now.\n# I am spending all my time with games and watching videos and listening to song with this monster. It ruined all my time (LOL),\n# I am still thinking what to mention in the cons, i really dont get points.\n# I cant give more than 5 star fo this product(\",)",

            "I got this tablet at Rs.5000/- only on Big Billion Day offer. Honestly I like to say that, it is a great tablet in performance with this price range. I have already a 1 year old Samsung Galaxy Tab 2, when I compared with my new Lenovo tablet with my old one, its performance and sound quality is much more than my old one Samsung Tab 2...... except its doesn't have 3g connectivity. Its already comes with Kitkat 4.4.2, and I also got a little update of 18.5MB update file when my device first startup. But only dislike thing of this tablet is the user interface, Samsung TouchWiz is best in comparison with this tablet. So I installed and switched to the Nova Launcer, and work well without any laggy and glitch. This tablet is well optimized in battery backup and processing speed, as because its comes with Kitkat and Mediatek QuadCore processor.....\n....... Finally I want to say... I am really happy with this tablet as what I am looking for, and also thanks for Flipkart's amzing offers........................",
            "I bought this tab on the big billion day. It's really worth for the money. My friend suggested not to buy any product online. But, I had some faith in Flipkart as I already bought a product here.. It has long battery life, works with all kind of video formats, Dolby digital sound is really good.. The negative features are lagging of 3G, can't move the apps to memory card. Overall if you would like to buy a branded tablet for cheap rate go for it.. I have ordered almost 10 products in Flipkart.. Everything is Good.. Thank you so much FIipkart guys..!!!",
            "I had a wish that i would have a tablet. I was planning for it but thanks to Flipkart Billion doller day i got that tablet for 5000.

My son plays games like Angry Bird, Temple Run, Spider-man, etc. It has very good battery backup. You can watch two movies, can play games more than 3 hours. The speaker is strong. If you compare with multimedia quality with Nexus tab, that will be unfair. But the purpose you buy tab for like playing video, games etc. serves absoutely fine.

Awesome look and feel too!\nI haven't used the call facility yet nor am I a hard core gamer, but it runs very smoothly on WiFi--the 1.3 GHz processor is at its best!

            "Thanks to Flipkart for such a superfast delivery. I ordered Lenovo A7-30 on Saturday around 4PM and next day on Sunday at 11:30PM the Flipkart guy (Nitin) was delivering it in my hands. I didn't paid any extra money for that \"Next Day Delivery\" (Rs. 90) but got the same experience.\nNow come to the tab, after checking so many tablets on Flipkart, I ordered this Lenovo A7-30 tablet by keeping in mind that Lenovo is a leading brand in Laptops and computers and the tablet looks nicely built in product pictures.\nThe tab is manufactured surprisingly in Hong Kong and not in other part of China. The overall built quality and finish of the tab is very good in compare to other China manufactured tabs. The tablet is light in weight as it has a Lithium Polymer battery instead of commonly used Lithium Ion battery.\nIn Rs.6599, a 1.3GHz Quad Core Processor, 1GB RAM and 8GB of onboard storage is a nice deal. The tablet came with Android 4.4.2 Kitkat version preloaded. It also comes with a microSD card slot and SIM slot. I bought along a Strontium 16GB Class 10 microSD card for this tablet.\nThis tab supports voice calling and 2G data.I checked the voice call quality and found it satisfactory. 2G data i haven't checked yet as i have connected it with my home WiFi which runs quite fast on this tab.\nThis tab has a unique feature of \"Dolby Sound\" which enhanced the sound quality on inbuilt stereo speakers when switched on in any app.\nI checked many apps on this tab and found them performing well. Thanks to the 1GB RAM and quad core processor. Games like My Talking Tom, Angry Birds, Angry Birds Go, Subway Surfer, Temple Run 2, PK etc. all ran smoothly. Playing HD videos in Youtube app freezes for few seconds in the start but normal quality video plays smoothly. I haven't yet checked the Full HD video playback in this tab.\nThe primary camera (2MP) quality is just ok and front camera (0.3MP) is actually poor. Being a budget tablet i ignored the camera quality at all.\nThe only drawback of this tab is the LCD screen. At 1024x600 the resolution is acceptable but being a TN (Twisted Nematic) LCD display, the viewing angles are poor.\nOne can clearly see flickering and running lines when viewing the screen from bottom angles. Lenovo made the cost down by not using IPS display in this tab.\n\nThe battery backup is very good as it has 3500mAh of capacity.\n\nIf you are looking for a budget tablet for Gaming & Internet purposes that too under 7K then Lenovo A7-30 is a best deal.",

It's also having a front camera captures good quality pictures for video chatting etc. calling facility is ok. net through sim is slow but routine tasks can be performed (2G).

It has a back camera of 2 MP and front camera is of 1.3 MP not 0.3 MP. It's Sound quality is fabulous and great. I have upgraded it to 4.4.2 and it's too nice.

            "I noticed the issue of the screen disappearing/flickering & tablet freezing for a few seconds when using mobile data connection for browsing. the SIM card isn't making a strong contact in the slot.\n\nThe GPS in it isn't all that great. I had to use an app to refresh the AGPS data to get proper location fix. The screen is good, at 1024 pixels it's not the sharpest display but manageable.\n\nThe sound quality when taking calls I haven't explored that yet. When listening to music its Awesome though because of the Dolby EQ feature which can be custom adjusted.\n\nThe apps work fast enough.\n\nThe front two speakers are quite loud, very useful for call alerts & listing to music The battery life is good so far, using the lenovo power management app in power saving mode & activating optional features helps improve the battery life. You get more battery time if there is no SIM inserted in the tablet. It takes 3hrs to fully charge the tablet from 1% battery life.\nI have upgraded it into KIT KAT 4.4 & its very easy to upgrade.\n\nThat's about it. The build quality seems alright, 2G connectivity is dated, so is the 2MP camera. The display is good The other features like RAM, ROM & CPU are useful. Hopefully overtime the freezing issue doesn't accelerate start happening unexpectedly more often.\n\nThanks to flipkart for delivering it within the given time period.\n\nGo for it 6.5k,.,.,,.no probs",

Otherwise will never even think to buy it\nvery very low camera can't even use in normal day light thus feel like having no camera\ndisplay is average.\nspeakers are good.\nGaming experiance also good but becoz of average display, u will not enjoy it much.\nonly recommend if budget is below 5k and company will provide within that price",
            "An amazing tablet. Got it on the big billion day sale, just for Rs. 5000. The tablet is pretty small, so don't expect it to be like an iPad or a Nexus. The screen resolution isn't good. Yes, I mean it. If you're much into high - res gaming, this ain't for you, If you play subway surfers and stuff, go for it. A quad core processor is what you'd say. But it is from MediaTek, and not Qualcomm. AT a whole, recommended for domestic use.\n\nThere's one glitch. The SD CARD door was broken when I received it. And I got it replaced, and hats off to Flipkart for that. But then this one also had a similar damage.\nthe door would be fine when you first open it. Then you're not able to close it. It just wouldn't. But then after trying a lot I did.",

It looks sophisticated,sound quality is awesome. Battery life I think will be great. As even after whole day's use it is still over 60 percent remaining. Only bad thing can be lack of 3G. If you have wi-fi mostly, than it's superb. Go for it. I will happily buy new dresses and accesories for it.Another thing, it does not contain a headset. So I have to buy one.Thanks flipkart and lenovo. The lst star will be added after prolonged use.",

The back case has started to crack though, probably because the tablet slipped through my hands several times. And BTW, I do not use any additional case or cover for my tablet.\n\nPros:\n- Excellent battery life. Lots of juice remaining even after continuous intensive use.\n- Super performance.\n- Not so bad sound as the tablet comes with Dolby.\n- ZERO software or hardware issues even after two years (except the back case cracks).\n- Runs vanilla android.\n- 5.7 GB usable space in the internal memory storage which is impressive.\n- Doesn't overheat even when running intensive games.\n- Charging is quite fast. 0 to 100% in around 3 hours.\nCons:\n- Bad touch responsiveness. Touch gets unresponsive most of the time and this makes it really irritating when typing, gaming etc.\n- Screen is a finger print magnet. Also, there is too much glare.\n- Comes with a bit of unremovable bloat.\n- Very bad camera quality, both front and back.\n- Build quality is very much ordinary.\n- Lacks sensors. Has only the accelerometer.\n- Light sensor doesn't work (I suspect that the tablet doesn't even have it although third-party apps show it).\n- Proximity sensor doesn't work. It malfunctions.",

After just few months of usage you will notice the LCD digitizer screen will bleach white making this product unusable and nothing but a waste !\nBeware ! when you take it to lenovo service -their reply will be that the LCD screen is damaged & broken ....which will SURPRISE you as you will not even notice a single hairline crack or damage anywhere on the external all sides. They will not accept this as a Internal display of a faulty rejected product sold cheaply on flipkart!\nBe wise and buy good products so they last long and will be good value for your money.\nNOT this PRODUCT ! ABSOLUTELY NOT DURING BIG BILLION SALE !",

            "Apple iPhone 5S\n\nThe Apple iPhone 5S takes the cake for being one of the most advanced smartphones of recent times. It features an amazing camera that lets you capture some great pictures and incorporates high-quality and powerful components for a superlative performance. As for the design, it pleases anyone who\u2019s looking for a sleek and stylish phone.\nPowerful Processor\n\nThe Apple iPhone 5S is equipped with a powerful A7 processor that is based on the 64-bit architecture. The A7 chip has double the capacity of the A6 chip, which means you will be able to enjoy multimedia games with complete 3D effects. This device also delivers a faster CPU performance and enables you to multitask by launching more than a couple of applications at the same time.\nMotion Detecting Coprocessor\n\nThe iPhone 5S has a motion detecting coprocessor, the M7 coprocessor, that senses motion-oriented data. So when you're consulting Maps while travelling or evaluating your performance on the treadmill with the aid of workout applications, the co-processor automatically starts functioning and takes the load off the main processor. It detects when you park the car and start walking towards your destination and automatically switches from driving to walking while you are navigating. What\u2019s more, the coprocessor recognises if the device has not been picked up for a while and reduces network usage to save on battery.\nHigh Resolution Touchscreen\n\nThe Apple smartphone features a 4-inch Retina multi-touch screen that gives you an enhanced visual experience. It has a high screen resolution of 1136 x 640 pixels and colour depth of 16M. The contrast ratio of the display is 800:1 and it has an oleophobic coating to withstand fingerprints. These features bring your photos, movies and videos to life and displays them with utmost clarity.\nExtremely Stylish\n\nWhat makes this advanced smartphone from Apple distinct from other phones is its precision construction mark in a sleek glass and metal golden colour aluminium casing. A sapphire crystal is fitted on the home button as well as near the iSight camera for protecting it. The sleek and light device measures 7.6mm in thickness and is great for one-handed use. You can choose from stunning shades like gold, silver and space grey.\nKeep Memories Fresh with iSight\n\nThe iPhone 5S comes with two superior cameras. The primary camera with a resolution of 8MP features the iSight technology that enables you to capture crystal clear snaps. Its burst mode feature lets you click 10 snapshots in one second and its sensor is relatively large to allow more light to pass through it. Both the white LED and amber LED deployed in the device, adjust the flash intensity and colour temperature of your picture for optimum results. You can capture panoramic shots and square pictures and even enhance your images with the help of multiple filters available in the phone. It is possible to zoom while recording a video and capture HD videos at the rate of 120 frames per second. Auto image stabilisation is another one of this iPhone\u2019s benefits, which makes sure your images have less noise. This feature also does away with the blurring effect caused due to hand and camera shake.\nAdvanced Security Features\n\nThis smartphone has an exclusive fingerprint identity sensor called Touch ID, that can recognize the impression of your fingers when they are placed on the home button. This smartphone by Apple will only unlock when you place your finger on the sensor. This technology ensures that nobody else is able to use the device. In case you want anyone else to have access to the phone, you can easily save their fingerprints on it as well. It is also possible to save your fingerprint as the password for iTunes and Apple App Store, making it safe for you to purchase applications and other digital content from the app store.\nFaceTime for Video Calling",

            "The tablet is good as per its configuration and overall performance.\n\nTill now its has only been used for web surfing and basic applications like facebook, music, and related media apps and the performance has been fine.\n\nDid not choose it for gaming though so could not comment on it yet.\n\nBuilt and feel is sturdy and nice.\nOption for expandable memory comes handy.\nDisplay quality is fine considering the price bracket.\nBattery works good due to not on 3G\n\nBut.....\n\n1. Flipkart (WS) had a promotion on the product when I ordered the same. They has a flip case coming free with it. Though it mentioned that the case is for A1000 Lenovo, but to assumption and logics it served the case was supposed to fit to the tablet purchased. BUT NO IT DID NOT.\n\nWhen reported to the customer services about the issue, they rephrased and informed me the same as I have mentioned above.\n\n>> Had this offer not been in place I would have ordered it through other seller from another portal selling the item for 7100 (which was 400 bucks lesser than flipkart\u2019s deal)\n\n>> I call this fooling your customer by miss-representing facts.\n\n2. The tablet itself goes to a test mode with few of options, surprisingly you can choose none. While is in the mode, you cannot reboot or shut down the device.\n\nLately I have realized that flipkart\u2019s services and deals have become pathetic and customer satisfaction which earlier was on priority is not the same now. Due to this I have started to use other portals like eBay, amazon.in and snapdeal. Which I find to be more accurate and reachable. This and last couple of orders I have placed with Flipkart has been ridiculous.\n\nI suggest that we must check other websites for pricing too as they give discounts over their self exaggerated pricing of commodities, like was done on THE BIG BILLION DAY\u2026 LOL",
            "At 8:20 AM the Tablet was at Rs 4999 instead of Rs 10500 (MRP). I placed the order however I was not expected the delivery so early exactly 25 Hrs (Next day approx 9:15 AM) I received the product. :) A big thanks to Flipkart. I've started using the TAB now. My finger crossed as I had bad experience earlier last year placing xperia but could not receive the product as it had gone out of stock. However I placed my bet this time & I'm lucky enough to get this product much before the promised delivery date.\nHope product meet my expectations:)\n\nOnce again thanks to Flipkart for this amazing deal.....",

I was sooo frustated by then, so , I contacted the courier service help line on my own( i tried previously also but they didnt reply mails, neither picked up phone .. \"delhivery\" courier)\nI even contacted local courier boy and visited local warehouse myself... there, the manager told me that your parcel was mistakenly sent smwhere else... we are looking into it.\n\nI then contacted flipkart... as expected, they were \"still LOOKING INTO IT\" .... I told them that please convey to your \"CONCERNED TEAM \" that i have sorted out the issue myself and the parcel is misplaced. you fools! then again after 1 day, they told me a new replacement is being shipped.. finally!! ..\nBUT, here comes the main scare... at that instant, the price of tab had fallen down to 6499..\nand look at me... m getting the same tab after 2 months, and FLIPKART guys are so rude that they didnt even offer me any sorry gesture by revising the rate fr me.
