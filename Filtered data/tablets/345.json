            "It's very sorry to say that Flipkart sells such brands & even do not offer proper customer service.\nDespite of mixed reviews on the product I still decided to go for it as the specs mentioned were really good and the price was also a highlight. But the product was delivered I personally faced below problems...\n1. Battery automatically discharges in 2-3 hrs without any usage.\n2. When battery reaches 25% mark tablet switches off automatically.\n3. Even though its a 4G tablet it hardly catches 4G network (tried with Idea and Vodafone 4G) hence speed is very slow.\n4. Camera and flash quality is pathetic, though its given as 5MP but results are like VGA camera.\n5. Flipkart seriously cheats here, I have marked the product return twice, Flipkart rejected. Then finally they agreed to send some technical person to inspect who never turned up. Thus 10 days replacement period is over and I am left with the same piece.\n5. Surely recommend NOT TO BUY this product or similar one which gives rosy pictures but in actual we end in frustration.",
