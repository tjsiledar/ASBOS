            "Go for it of you don't play games much , light apps like the video streaming an all runs smoothly ,if you want perfect performance gor for IPad 8th or 7th otherwise this is the best.\nAudio is crazy loud and crisp , battery is really good and other features like the Google Assistant built in with ambient mode is nice and I guess you can watch Netflix in HD and other OTT too since Netflix was not by default installed. The display is cool and the adjustable stand and unique design stands apart nicely.",

Best in the range\n2.big screen\n3.good quality speakers\n4.Can use sim and wifi\n5.Expandable memory\n6.Inbuilt stand is best thing\n7.Camera is good\n\nBut\n1.Battery backup is not so good.(1 day max)\n2.Lags in Prepladder app.\n3.Played COD not impressed, run on low settings.\n\nOverall for online classes and for watching movies it is best in the range.\nAnd you want high performance I would not suggest it.\ud83d\ude0e",
            "Just awesome. Thank you Flipcart. Giving such as a Smart Tab. I love Flipcart. Am so happy.",
            "The best tablet in the segment The camera is good for online class battery backup is best JBL speaker are amazing screen is mind-blowing looks are very good all functions work good thanks Flipkart.",
            "Initially I was a bit scared about my decision to go for one. Once I received the package, I heard it out.\nPros.\n1. Sound system is incredible.\n2. Excellent display. No compromise on the quality.\n3. Ample storage\n4. Convenient design. Easy in terms of portablility\n5. Battery life is good enough for a day.\n6. Built is good. Provides good protection.\n7. No complicated operations. Friendly user interface.\n8. It's has got a lot of utility options which helps in almost all situations.\n\nCons.\n1.The built in Google is not for everyone. It can be annoying most of the time.\n2. Though the screen is good, cracks on the edge in case of any impact is probable.(screen guard and case highly recommend)\n3. The processor of this device is the biggest disappointment. Was an ace during it's day, now it's pretty much outdated. The RAM compensates for the power, but chances of a lag cannot be eliminated.\n4. It tends to be slippery most of the times.\n\nIt's a must go for those who have casual to moderate use, especially for commuting. Bulk use can lead to the device getting stuck. For the prince of 21,000 rupees, it is justified in terms of the sound system, screen quality and use. But not in terms of its processor.",
            "It is a very faster and very perfect application for business , office work,gaming\n\nWe can Pubg , free fire , cod this tab",
            "Smart Tab For Smart People.\nLiterally a nice choice if your main purpose is just for entertainment like watching movies,videos playing games and internet surfing. I had been using this for now almost 15 days and till now overall good experience. Camera quality is just ok. Google assistant works well but I think if a stylus is provided with the tab it will be of great use.",
            "I liked this product, do not expect performance of a laptop, but in all other respects worth for the money we pay, no hesitation in recommending this product for an average user. Packing by Flipkart not good at all .",
            "The build quality is sturdy and design looks premium \ud83d\udc4c. The display is very amazing and the sound quality is awesome...it is perfect for multimedia purposes. Very pleased with the product \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude0a",
            "Good product with clear audio. Picture is good while talking.\nProblem\n1.zoom app gets disconnected after sometime.\n2. Netflix with only SD. No full HD for the same.\n\nOver-all good product for the price.",
            "1. Looks good and easy to handle particularly with the innovative stand.\n2. 2W x 2 JBL speakers Dual HiFi Dolby Speakers produce stunning sound\n3. Screen attracts finger print with no protection need to buy screen guard separately\nFor some reason, some apps closes automatically which is no annoying!\nLenovo should have provided a sleeve and Gorilla glass otherwise excellent product.\nOnly Android 9 is available as of 17th Feb 2021 while my phone costs less is running on Android 10. Lenovo should provide updates.",
            "Its a good product.easy to handle .\nIt has 1 disadvantage that it takes more time to charge around 3 hrs . All features are good after charging it runs for almost 14hr to complete die battery.\nSound quality is super feels like we are in party or club.\nThe new features ambient is cool..in less money it is very good quality product.i like this at most. It is perfect for study as well as movie, hearing songs.",

When i searching for it felt apple is too costly.\nLater tried searching other options and found Lenovo Yoga Smart tab with google assistant and got impressed with design(stand is really great).\nIts light weight and easy to use\nJBL speaker cylinder is awesome. If you raise the volume full and keep it in hall center you will feel like theater(This is my first need because always listen to songs)\nLook at the configuration 4 GB RAM & 64 GB ROM extendable up to 256 GB.\nI was searching the place to place to insert the sim and later got the to know its under the back stand...just press the button stand will open inside you will find the slots.\nThe main thing i liked is since we all WFH we no need to by headset.\nReally worth for 21k also i bought the same for my Uncle as well",

            "I bought it for 22k only to find prices went down to 20k a day later... This is completely unfair to customers. Hence the low rating.\n\nAlso camera could be better than 8MP at this price point. Phones have better camera below this price point so why are tablets an exception?\n\nBattery will last only 6-7 hours on a full charge and moderate net surfing, so the claim of full day long lasting battery is a farce.\n\nSound quality is great though. That does not disappoint you.",

            "Good product",
            "I think this is overall \ud83d\udc4d",
            "Bought this for my wife. She used to watch her favorite shows on a mobile phone. For a better viewing experience, general browsing & Zoom calls I was looking for a suitable tab.\n\nApart from Ipads, other tabs in this price range have poor specs. They are low on RAM like Samsung Galaxy which is 3+32 and cost more. This has the added advantage of JBL speakers. Having bought it, there are no regrets.\n\nThe screen resolution is very good. Most streaming services like Netflix, Youtube, Hotstar render very well on this screen. The audio quality is also very good.\n\nThe outer surface has a rubberized finish which makes holding it very comfortable. Unlike Ipads with their shiny Aluminium surfaces you get scared of dropping them. The rear stand is very useful. You can put it on a table and watch while attending to other work. For other tabs you need to buy a case with stand to get the same level of functionality. So overall a very good package.\n\nI bought it during the Big Savings Days and got a HDFC bank discount. Cost me less than 19K without any exchange.\n\nIf you need a decent tab for general purpose use, this is the best option. Far better value than Samsung or Ipads.",
