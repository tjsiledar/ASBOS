It's large 17.8-cm WXGA TFT screen produces rich images at a resolution of 1280x700 pixels, so you can thoroughly immerse yourself in the entertainment of your choice.",

When fully charged, this tablet can operate for a duration of up to 9 hours as it comes with a powerful 4000-mAh battery. So, you can watch a few good movies at a stretch without having to recharge the battery.",

Very Good Tablet for simple uses like web browsing, Microsoft office, PDF and ebook reading, watching movies and video, playing music etc. It also has reading mode for reading at night, supports Dual nano sim card and memory card too. Build quality and Screen Quality is also very Good at 216ppi which is good for a tablet of 7 inch.\n\nThe tablet also has few demerits like it takes about 3 hours to full charge because battery capacity is only 1A so it cannot support fast charging. Besides this, usable internal memory is around 3.8GB out of 8GB but considering the price of 8010 rupees, its a very good tablet from a well known brand Samsung and best in this price range. I got the best deal for this tab about 4000 rupees lower than the market price of 11,900 rupees. Thanks.",

            "The Tab is excellent at the price point.\nThe touch is smooth and responsive.\nCamera at 8mp with led flash light is capable to take good images. Front camera adequate. Not recomended for selfies much.\nDual sim which also supports 4g volte along with a dedicated micro sd cars.\nDisplay is great when seen from different angles.\nThe quad core processor is good enough to handle all the things at it self.\nThe only 2 disappointed factors are\n1.5 gb of ram, 3gb of ram would bave been enough at this price bracket. Also the tablet runs on 5.1.1, in tbe era of oreo 8.0 the tablet has lollipop 5.1.1.\nWould have been 5star if samsung is atleast able to roll out android 7.0.",

The touch of the phone is not good. Sometime you have to tap twice on sapce bar or some other key.\n\n2. Its charging is very-very slow. After putting it into charge for 3-4 hrs barely it get charged 20-25% only.\n\n3. The bottome back and menu button doesn't have back light. So when you use thia tab in night in absence of light, it is hard to find the back or menu key.\n\nThis phone disappointed me as brand samsung because i am using samsung from last 7 years and i blindly trust on them.\n\nBut this time not and in future it force me to think 10 times before going for samsung tab.\n\nHope this will help other to make their decision.",
