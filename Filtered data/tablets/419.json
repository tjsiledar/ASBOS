            "I wanted a 10 inch tablet and was tight on budget. I gave this tablet a try because it's made by Alcatel (which is a trademark of nokia). Alcatel-Lucent is a very big name in telecommunications, but not so famous in india. Turns out I got a jackpot. Personally even I wasn't expecting such a nice tablet for rs.7000. Initially it was slow but after updating all softwares it is working smoothly. Back cover is provided for free. Battery life is amazing, but it takes time to charge fully. Overall it's a really nice product. If you want something big to read pdf this tablet is a go.",

            "I have been looking for an affordable big screen tablet for quite some time. My other 7\" tablet was getting old and its small screen wasn't quite made for reading books or mags. This Alcatel tablet that I got for a great bargain price just meets all my needs. It's got a big screen that's just right for endless reading, a big battery that really lasts and a great screen. They have very thoughtfully included a back case as well as a screen guard for the tablet (in the package). I don't use heavy apps or gaming apps so I cant vouch for those, but for those bibliophiles out there, this is just perfect!",

            "1. the battery life is good around 6 to 10 hrs screen on time. battery capacity is 4100 mah.\n\n2. performance is good for daily work for two or three opened at once time.\n\n3. audio is at back side and average.\n\n4.quality of screen is good is IPS display but contrast ration is average.\n\n5. good for net surfing and reading books.\nbelow 320p video looks bad.\n\n6. the tablet is good around 6000 RS.\n\nconclusion. if have budget above 20000 RS then don't go for it otherwise after habit you will like this tablet.",

It only has one speaker at the back of the tablet and it's voice gets muffled however u use it.\nrest assured this is a wonderful tablet for the price bracket in which it is offered.....used primarily for media consumption and reading pdf's\nedit: now they have fixed the image so i'm changing its stars from one to four."
