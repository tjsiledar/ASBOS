            "At this price range it's a good product. A better speaker , display & touch would have made this product more attractive . For normal use other than gaming it appears to be a good buy. Jio works well . Preloaded apps can't be removed .Camera just okay ..battery pretty good and no heating issues till now. Charger cable too short . Data on off toggling with airplane mode ..that's one issue need to fix . Windows key board and android key board works for some office job. It got a preloaded office app upgradable to premium . Apps can be installed to external SD card also. Body average . Weight is also very less easily holdable . As mentioned by flipkart Processor is Mediatek MT8765. But I could not find out this processor from Mediatek official site . What I could figure out from the Baseband version given is MT6739 probably the processor is MT6739 64bit ARM Cortex A53 Octacore 1.5 M Hz about which there is a mention on Mediatek site. What I could put together is if not into heavy gaming , only for some surfing and reading then it's a reasonable buy.",
            "Good product lets see how it works after few months...so came after 6 7 months ..i got it at 5000 and now its price is 9k lol..anyway from my experience i use it to see physics video lectures and it helped me in other education purpose but it lag little and i have to wait for mins to open a pdf file moreover the excell work very slowy from the beginning..camera quality bad....so now i only use for you tube where video quality is good....",
            "I got it for Rs. 7199/- after discount. For this price this is an excellent buy. Pros: Light weight* Good battery * Android 8.1.0* With 4g Volte* You can hold & call easily in one hand. Cons: In sunlight display is very bad. Camera is not that good. Opinion: In this price range, this is very good in hand. I mainly use it for reading purpose with little surfing the net. Not interested in gaming. Go for this tab, if it's for reading, studying & surfing the net for YouTube etc.. I'm not using WhatsApp, Facebook etc.. in this tab. So, I don't know about heavy usages. Overall, This tablet won't disappoint you if you purchase it for around 8k. Thanks.",

            "Overall you can find many other tabs better than this in the market.\n1) Not as expected performance for a 3Gb RAM. It's overall below average performance.\n2) Even at this price point doesn't have flash and Camera is poor.\n3) Shifting from one App to other is slow, very lazy and sleepy.\n4) Screen resolution is only upto average.\n5) Battery backup is just average.",
            "I am using this Tab for checking emails and reading. Product is worth for the amount. I paid 8.5K after discount. My usage is not heavy. I am playing PUBG and Asphalt with medium display settings without any issues. Please don't expect performance like iPad from this Tab. For normal daily usage it's good. But go for only 3gb RAM and 32gb memory.",

            "Fastest delivery from flipkart yet. I ordered it at night after 11pm and I received it in the next day morning. That's a great thing about flipkart.\nWell, tab is good in budget with good display, good battery, and good processor.\nIt's good for reading or multimedia purpose. Not good for heavy gaming and camera. For video calling it's okay, but for taking pictures and selfies, it's not recommended.\nMy main purpose was for reading , so i am completely satisfied with it yet.\ud83d\ude0a",
            "My honest review.\nMy use - as a regular phone (yes, and it fits in my pocket perfectly)\nCamera - 0.5/5 (just coz it has a camera for the sake of it)\nScreen - 4/5 ( watch YouTube videos without any hitch)\nBattery - 5/5 (exceptional even thought only 4000 mah)\nSpeed - 5/5 (I didn't have any problems so far switching between apps)\nSpeaker - 4/5 (Satisfactory)\nGetting a case for this is difficult.\nOverall I'm happy with my purchase.\nI am not a gamer so I will not comment on this.\nEditing document...\nREAD MORE",

            "Fastest delivery from flipkart yet. I ordered it at night after 11pm and I received it in the next day morning. That's a great thing about flipkart.\nWell, tab is good in budget with good display, good battery, and good processor.\nIt's good for reading or multimedia purpose. Not good for heavy gaming and camera. For video calling it's okay, but for taking pictures and selfies, it's not recommended.\nMy main purpose was for reading , so i am completely satisfied with it yet.\ud83d\ude0a",
            "My honest review.\nMy use - as a regular phone (yes, and it fits in my pocket perfectly)\nCamera - 0.5/5 (just coz it has a camera for the sake of it)\nScreen - 4/5 ( watch YouTube videos without any hitch)\nBattery - 5/5 (exceptional even thought only 4000 mah)\nSpeed - 5/5 (I didn't have any problems so far switching between apps)\nSpeaker - 4/5 (Satisfactory)\nGetting a case for this is difficult.\nOverall I'm happy with my purchase.\nI am not a gamer so I will not comment on this.\nEditing documents and multitasking is smooth.\nNeed a Bluetooth to use it as a phone.\n\nA highly recommended Budget friendly device.",
            "Nice and flawless product in very economic price range.....there is hardly any tab in given price range with 3gb+32gb combo...overall quality is good except scope for improvement in side buttons which may not sustain beyond a year use......\nReco: std. headphone/earphone and flipcover could be provided by company as a part of std. Accessories....as there is lack of good quality covers....\noverall 4.5/5",
            "Great Performance\nIts really worth buying this tab at this price range. Very good battery backup. Great and wide display for reading lovers like me. I bought this only for the sake of reading and browsing..so I'm very much satisfied with this. For hard users like gaming and camera this is not advisable. Overall this tab has all the latest features with great performance though it has mediatek processor. If u r a light to medium user, go for it....",

Searched a few TABs on Flipkart but opted for Alcatel Tab, it's been more than a week and I can say it's a very good purchase in terms of money spent and performance of this device.\n*Good battery back up almost whole day as I spent most of the evening hours on\nLoopscoop & Injoy kinda' apps\n*Comparatively better display and UI instead of Iball and other low price TABs\n*Better RAM management3GB, I get more than 50% most of the times, 21GB\nROM spared even after lids of mp3s and apps installed\n*Graphics is tolerable as it's under RS8000 Tab so it's fine and no issues\n*So far no lags no heat-ups and no hangs even on multi-tasking and multiple\napps used at same time frame.\n*Camera is ok ok as I haven't purchased this TAB for selfies or for clicks, if you\nneed a better camera TAB then you must go for any mobile phone.\n*Screen and display is better and good for even a child's eyes.\nFinal word; awesome ALCATEL Tab deal for me as it replaced my ageing Micromax canvas 6 and doing great job for me, loved by everyone at my home.\nThank Flipkart for such a great great low price deal @ Republic Day sale\ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00, I saved hefty 4-5000 INR , thnx EKARTel executive for 3rd day delivery at my desired location.",
