            "A decent tablet from Alcatel . you can't expect anything extraordinary in this price range.\nPros:\n1) A huge HD display. You can actually enjoy watching movies, YouTube, Netflix. It's a 720p display, so maintain a distance from screen.\n2) Great for reading books.\n3) It supports 4G Volte.\n4) Sound is loud enough ( Quality is not upto the mark )\n\nCons:\n1) User interface is not that smooth. Never expected this much lagging.\n2) You can't run any large application, even small games won't run smoothly.\n3) Camera experience is pathetic.\n\n*** If you have a tight budget ,can't spend more than Rs. 6500 - 7000 , and watching videos and reading books is your primary priority, then trust me this is the best tablet for you.\n**** Disable some pre-installed apps which you think you won't use. It will add some speed in your Tab.\n\nHit like if my review was helpful to you. Thanks for reading. Have a good day.",
            "Nice tablet under 6999/-\nonly problem is it's camera which is VGA type . It has WINDOWS 10 like feature which is good because it looks like laptop feeling. only HD video supported\nTouch is very smooth. Battery backup is also nice up to 6hrs for videos.....",
            "Good tab at this price point\nif u ar using it for reading pdf books its a good option at budget range\n\nCamera is absolute garbage\n\nScreen quality is not good especially if you're planning to buy this for watching movie eventhough its a hd screen\n1080p videos are playable but don't expect the quality like from our mobile (same with YouTube also only upto 720 p are only playable)\n\nBattery backup is really astonishing even though its a 4080mah it give me a screen on time time of around 5- 5:30 hours which is pretty good Thanks to the under powered Quad-Core processor(no fast charging facility they are bundling with 5V 2A charger)\n\nGames are playable under low graphics setting without any lag(Don't even think of playing PUBG and other high end games) Currently i installed beach buggy racing and temple run which works fine\n\nOverall bulit quality of the product is acceptable\nThe gud thing is they are bundling it with head phone & screen guard\n\nTwo front firing Speakers are really loud but clarity decrease as we increase volume but gud\n\nOverall I am satisfied only thing disappointing is the screen quality",
            "1. Display: 3.5/5 FHD would have been better but readings and videos are good\n2. Sound: 3/5 I have purchased the model without soundbox but it's fine for listening to songs and watching videos.\n3. Speed; 4/5 The laptop doesnt hang even after loading so many apps and is pleasant to use.\n4. Battery backup 4/5 Lasts a day with moderate use.\n5. Touch : 3.5/5 Touch is good but could have been better ( Using phones feel more smooth to touch then this tablet)\n6. Value for money : 5/5 I got it at 6999 with 10% discount which is a decent deal.\n7. Seller packing: 1/5 I have never seen an expensive product packaged so poorly ever. Even utensils come properly packed than this tablet came\n8 Design: 5/5 The tablet looks very beautiful and is amazingly light weight.\n9. Camera 1/5 Horrible at this era of cameras.\n10. Flipkart exchange policy : 1/5 They just refuse to take old smartphones giving nonsense reasons so never try to exchange in Flipkart.\nEdit: After 1 week of use :\nThis tablet software is not very user-friendly. I am mentioning the issues faced\n1. You cant see the data transfer speed in notification like other mobile phones(No option to activate)\n2. Rotation lock doesn't work if your tablet goes to landscape mode. It will override rotation lock and rotate.\n3. Flipkart which has been provided by the tablet keeps crashing the moment you search any product in it.\n4. No notification light is there (a hardware missing feature)\n\nPlease let me know if you find a solution to these problems.",
            "I've ordered this tab on 29 September & received on 4th October.when I received,the display of the tab was broken then I make a return request.After the day I've called the customer care & they respond very well & the seller approved my return request. Thereafter I reorder the tab & get fully good package .the performance of the tab is very great at this price range.overall good product. Thank u flipkart & indiflashsmart seller.",
            "Tablet is slow extremely slow ...if you uninstall netplex and other useless software than tablet give you proper response other wise it's crash YouTube several time ...video quality is good Respect to 7000 sound is also good don't expect too much...good deal for reading and YouTube..not at all for game for watching movie and YouTube is better deal",
            "Bought this in a good deal during sale. Both front and back Camera is like VGA with no clarity to read small printed words. When downloading camera app, it shows max of 2MP when the product says 5MP. Except this the battery, performance is good so far. It solves the purpose of learning for my kid",

This is the only 10 inch tab I could find in this price range (~6000rs at sale) although if you're buying it at 9-10k I wouldnt say it offers that much value for money.\n\n-on starting up you might notice that screen is not as crisp as the ones on your phones, but its not that bad either\n-Perfect for PDFs, even heavy pdfs ~300mb with lots of pictures and diagrams work without stutter ( I used Xodo pdf reader, some other pdf readers maybe laggy)\n-Great for casual youtube/movie watching, the 2 front facing speakers are great and loud and the sound doesnt get distorted at max volume\n-Not built for heavy multitasking as too many background apps may cause it to stutter, though this tab can handle chrome with ~4 tabs, whatsapp,youtube and pdf reader in the background but some pages/apps in the background may reload when you switch to them\n-Basic microUSB cable/charger/earphones are included. The screen protector included is a plain plastic one not tempered glass",

You can clearly see the glitches while navigation and opening of apps.\n2. The major problem is with the software of the device. Every time you switch off the device for more than 10 minutes, Netflix app was deleted.\nThe more concerning thing with this was that the service center do not have the correct software as the Alcatel does not have it with themselves.",
