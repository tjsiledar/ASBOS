Totally worth it and I had been waiting for this product to be in stock for a very long period of time. A12 Bionic chip and 3 GB RAM are extremely helpful for me to run heavy applications. On the other hand, the relatively smaller size makes it comfortable to carry and work anywhere and anytime. If you are a traveller, this device will never disappoint you.

Played both PUBG and COD and both ran without even breakung any sweat on highest graphics quality. Takes around 3 hrs to fully charge and lasts about half a day on heavy usage which consists of heavy gaming and browsing on chrome and YouTube playback. A good family device and a good e book reader.

            "Well, it's an iPad released in 2019, having 7.9 inch IPS Retina display. There are still plenty of reasons to buy it in 2020. You can watch videos in YouTube regarding this if required. Thanks to Apple's A12 bionic chip with 3gb RAM runs buttery smooth with zero lag and unlike android sheer performance can be observed in iPad. iPad OS makes the user experience even better. Sites are opened as desktop site in browser. There're dual stereo speakers of good quality and thankfully, 3.5mm jack is still present in this 2019 model.\nAt first I was unable to decide among ipad 7th gen, mini 5 and air 3. After doing some research, I finally thought to go for this one as this one is having a12 chipset (7th generation iPad has a10, other reasons to avoid 7th gen model is the non-laminated display, 1st gen touch id etc.) & I can manage with 7.9 inch screen size (and also pocket friendly so I didn't choose air3). Moreover, mini 5 is having the highest PPI so the display is sharp and crisp.\nIf you are buying it for the purpose of reading, gaming, browsing internet, streaming and watching media contents, then you can surely go for it without any hesitation.\nThere're many aspects of small screen size. Advantage for some and disadvantage for some. To talk about disadvantages, while using apple pencil(while note taking), you may face little bit difficulty as your palm will rest to the edges because of small screen size. [***It supports 1st generation Apple Pencil only***] While watching movies, you may not get that feel which you'll get watching in large screen size. Again, the portability is greatly increased as mini 5 is compact in size.\nI expected they'll provide 12 watt charger atleast with this but what they provided is 10 watt. Be it 10 watt or 12 watt, it will take around 4 hours to charge the battery fully.\nI will suggest you guys to go for it if you can manage with 7.9 inch screen size. If you need bigger size with a12 chipset, go with air 3, the daddy version of it & if you can manage with a slower processor a10 and bigger screen size, go for 7th generation model. Good luck. \ud83d\ude0a",
            "Awesome device for studies... Camera is really underestimated.. It's great for scanning... And even decent pics.\n\nI got great discount from appairo seller... Got this for 38000. 256 gb wifi only. (i couldn't believe first then i ordered quickly)\n\nReally awesome for reading... One note app... Video editing..\n\nSometimes when studying and writing with pencil... Size may feel small... But overall. Its great device.\n\nSmooth a12 processor feels awesome.\nIt heats even when streaming high quality videos.. That's not a major issue though.",
            "What else I can say about this beast , its performance exceeds my expectations . Forget money this is the best mini tablets you can find on market . It\u2019s worth every penny you spend on this . Navigation is smooth as butter and playing games , man o man it plays every game you throw at it .",
            "The device is excellent...i was going for 10.2 inch ipad...but it has only 32 gb storage....and the screen is not great ..and the front camera is only one megapixel.\nThis ipad mini is best...\nbut i don't know why the volume button in my unit is little loose..it is working properly but one button is ok and one is loose..idk why\nI bought it for online classes ...and it is great...The 10.2 ipad is bigger....i can use this anywhere...its very portable",
            "I purchased this ipad mini 5th gen in August 2019. And its December 2019 now. Gaming and reading does not have any problem in this. I play PUBG everyday and it plays the game with breeze. No lag, no disconnection problem. Battery is very good. It gives the backup of 2 days in normal to heavy usage. Sound quality in headphones is very loud and crisp. And fingerprint sensor works nicely without delay. Picture quality is very good. But the camera quality is average. Good for tablets.\nOverall a ...\nREAD MORE",
            "Awesome experience with the product. You can feel the quality involved once you start using. Pocket sized , best of all iPads according to size and price . Only con is it will not support apple 2nd gen \u270f\ufe0f .",
            "Awesome product ..best device for gaming...amazing performance.. Awesome PUBG Experience. Very Smooth. If you are planning to purchase this for gaming then go for it..One word go for it\nIt\u2019s powerful device...",
            "Some may say its expensive, but dont forget that you are getting the fastest SoC at this price. The 2018 A12 Bionic chip STILL outperforms some of the 2019 Snapdragon 855 smartphones in certain tests. But remember the optimization of iOS which helps it perform better in real life usage.\n\nPROS:\n1) Perfect size and Weight- Helps in hour long reading, surfing and specially playing games. Try playing PUBG on an iPAD Pro for more than 1 hour, i bet your arms will start giving away,\n2) A12 Bionic Chip is super efficient and powerful, will make your device remain relevant for another 3-5 years, considering its a 7nm SoC and its really difficult to manufacture something smaller than this. 4nm SoC are around 4-5 years away.\n3) Awesome True Tone display! Really helpful at night.\n4) Great graphical performance without heating issue. Can play 60fps PUBG for hours without frame drop. (Samsung Galaxy S10 with its SD 855 over heats within 30mins, thus making its 'powerful' SoC useless )\n\nCONS:\n1) Camera is pretty bad. But then this is a tablet.\n2) There is no 128GB model. 64GB is too less and 256GB model is too expensive.\n3) No Jailbreak for iOS 12.2 (yet)",
            "This is still a beast even in May 2021 and bought it specially for pubg mobile, reading books, mangas and writing content. To be honest, the performance of this ipad is way more than what you expect, works best for all of my work. Earlier, I was using an android flagship smartphone for playing pubg but switching to Ipad mini it seems that the performance, I am getting on this is 5 times more than the average android flagship smartphone. So I highly recommend you to go with this one.",
            "The 2019 version of iPad mini is a solid device. It has a niche market and it fills that market with ease.\n\nPerformance is buttery smooth and the battery life is great for both active usage and standby. Recommended for anyone wanting a highly portable tablet with the processing power for a number of demanding tasks. Also great for reading ebooks.",
            "VERY NICE PRODUCT BY APPLE ....AS I TOOK IT FOR PUBG AND PUBG RUNS VERY SMOOTH LIKE BUTTER...THE GRAPICS IN WHICH I PLAY IS HDR AND ULTRA ......GOOD BATTERY ....NICE WORK BY FLIPKART AND APPLE",
            "Just awesome beast a power house thAt can destroy anything u can throw on it..Apple soc + custom made apple graphics chip is all power u need . Design is cute no complaints but it can improve .everthing is just awesome coming from iPad Pro 10.5",
            "1. Handy - Easy to carry anywhere.\n2. Excellent Performance.\n3. It will support Spatial Audio when watching the Dolby Atmos / Dolby Vision Movies by using Apple Air Pods Pro. Finally, Apple has\ngiven the Movie theatre experience in the Air pods by using IPAD MINI 5.\n4. Storage out of 64GB we have got 56GB free and Ram is 3GB with A12 Bionic.\n5. Good cameras at this price for facetime calls.\n6. While Playing heavy games like Call of Duty there is no frame drops & lags.\n7. YouTube videos support up to 4K (2160 HDR).\n8. Worst delivery by a flip kart.",
            "This is clearly an expensive product, however it's well worth the money.\n\nThe general tablet ecosystem is pretty rubbish, and I've been looking for a tablet for my kids and for home use in general. Looked at a few Android tablets and they all seemed subpar. Not to mention the fact that the only Android tablets worth buying are in the price range of an iPad.\n\nI picked the iPad mini over the 2019 iPad Beecher l mostly because of the A12 bionic chip in the mini. from an overall performance point of view, I didn't want to compromise.\n\nTo be fair, I may have enjoyed media more on a bigger tablet screen, but for the most part this is reasonably big enough. Especially since the screen itself is very high quality.\n\nThe battery life hasn't been typical Apple standard, but that may be because my kids watch a lot of media on it, in full brightness and full volume.\n\nThe only thing I felt was not as I had expected was the sound output. Overall quality seems okay, but unless I'm watching on full volume, the speakers don't carry as much power.\n\nAll in all a great buy. Happy so far",
            "i bought this device not for any specific use but due to specs A12 bionic + 3gb ram .\nbuild wise ipad mini 4 and 5 are same .\nbeing first time apple user , the interface is very royal and awsome , lot of sweat involved in making this interface I guess .\nawsome to have an high spec apple product at low cost .\nvery very good deal .\nbetter than snap dragon 855(see antutu bench score) , with high refresh rate\ndont waste money on android flag ship .\nthis is best deal in the given price range .\nonly downside for ipad is no sms call whatsapp .",
            "This is my 1st ever apple product and I am glad that I bought it. Worth it for every penny spent. Long lasting battery performance(not for gamers though). Charging speed doesn't matter to me although for a normal person you are going to charge it at night and not going to need it throughout the day so don't worry about in-boxed charger.\nIf you want to upgrade from 6 inch mobile screen to this device then you will be surprised for its compact nature. There are many tablets out there with bigger screens but believe me that the portability it gives in hand cannot be replaced by other tablets.\nAbout apple pencil- Sure its a overhead cost that you going to bear but let me assure you that this device is incomplete without its apple pencil functions. If you have money to spent then go ahead with apple pencil otherwise there are plenty of 3rd party styluses out there for iPads.\n\nI hope this will help. Thanks",
            "My first iPad & second Apple product. As far as experience is quite good. From reviews in YouTube and Flipkart, I found it to be fittest to serve my purposes. Let's hope for the best. It has easy grip, stunning display and latest processor. I also has bought pencil-1 separately to make full use of it. Camera ok, battery is good. Purchase of a screen protector and cover is also recommended.",
            "is awesome product price is some high for this size but apple is for premium customer and the performance and display quality and battery backup is like just wow !!\nA12 bionic 64 bit chip gives you extraordinary performance so this will give you new type feeling for next 3 to 4 years because in 6th gen ipad 2018 9'7 inch A 10 fusion chip processor is used which was launched in iPhone 7 in 2016 and same in ipad 2018 so apple always have future ready technology so no need to worry just enjoy it . it is useful for students , for business professional on portability mode and for share trading individuals it is very good product. over all value for money and I request to apple please reduce price in India if this would be available in 28-30 thousands this will make record of sale this is in my words awesome product",
            "A portable cum powerful piece of beast is the new iPad mini 2019. Made my work pretty organised. Great battery life, no heating problem at all. Camera is good enough. Can be held in one hand. Fast delivery. Go for it if it\u2019s within your budget.",

Camera is OK as in most tablets are\n7.Light weight\n\nIn a nutshell, if u want a apple device that's is not too big for hands nor too short this is it. it can blow away any games no matter how much graphic intensive..\nabsolute value for money..\nthanks\nwriting this after 3 days of continues usage!!",
            "Ipad mini5 is a very cool and smooth like butter,and value for money ,the processor is A12bionic chip set is awesome for gameing like PUBG and etc .it's running very smooth and faster then other Apple phone.the 3gb RAM is most beating any other android 8/12gb ram .i Loved ipad mini 5 as my opinion",
            "I have already a 6th gen 9.7 inch. I was looking for a Pro or Air for music production. But they comes with new C type connector. Earlier I bought a lighting to usb 3 camera connection kit. That kit works with mini 5. And this model supports my apple pencil 1. So I picked mini 5. Before I got the tab I did not like the size. But after using it for 4-5 days I understand that I was wrong. The display is too good, far better than the 9.7 6th gen. Moreover, I can hold it with one hand. This is really handy, but powerful enough. Far more powerful than the A10 processor (6th or 7th gen). A12 Bionic processor, GPU & 3GB ram is enough to run Sampletank pro + Miraslov 1 & 2 (7.5 GB app size) without any issue. Plus point: it has also a headphone jack which is not present in pro or air. To me there is no better option than this. The pro is more powerful but very costly too. After 2 or 3 years configuration will be upgraded with newer models. It is not easy to buy a 100k tab every 2 years. But a budget like mini may be considered.\nFlipkart delivered me before time. The parcel was also very nicely packed (1st: outer plastic bag to protect from water, 2nd: hard cardboard box to protect the product box, 3rd: seal packed original product box). The product is genuine, new, recently imported and about 1K less than the Apple store. Yes I recommend others to buy it from Flipkart.",
            "Thank u Flipkart for the expeditiously great delivery. I received the product within 2 days. It\u2019s an mini IPad Pro u can say with powerful processor and butter like display. I was very much confused about the size of the product as this is my first tablet, but decision was right in this purchase. The device is very slim and handy. I got space grey which is astonishingly superb.\nMust buy product . Thank u Flipkart once agin for a genuine apple product.",
            "the ipad is best for gaming !\nThe bionic 12 chipset is easily handle pubg in extreme graphics !\nI impressed with it's performance .\nBut the camera is just ok .Not good .",
            "Best value for money. I chose to buy the iPad mini instead of an expensive phone and boy am I glad. It\u2019s a superb device and can handle anything you throw at it. Be it gaming, reading e-books, browsing, editing, sketching and much more. It\u2019s gonna last me years with the sort of software support Apple is renowned for. The only shortfall is when watching videos in certain aspect ratios as the black bars at the top and bottom of the video can get quite big. Nevertheless, great device and I absolutely love it.\n\nP.S. The form factor is it\u2019s biggest strength compared to the other iPads.",
            "Its a few years old at this point but I had previous gen accessories that work with this form factor so went along with it.\nA12 will last at least a couple of years more. Cellular is the killer feature. Display is as good iPad Pro 9.7.\nJust grabbed the cellular model for under 35 k.\nThe portability alone makes it worth the price. The price in the sale makes it worth the purchase.\nYou can go for iPad mini 6 if you want the newer form factor & future proofing till 2025-26.\n\nBut as for a stop gap iPad....nothing beats the 2019 iPad mini.Period",
            "My first IOS device. Been almost 10 days using it. Loved it so far. Camera not so good as it's not meant or made for photography . However Performance wise it Awesome. A12 Bionic is all you need, I believe unless 5G gets updated! Overall 4/5 score as far by me.",
            "Have been using the iPad mini for the past 4 months. While I generally avoid Apple products purely because people associate unwanted status symbol to some inanimate object, the experience of using it is as usual excellent. The touch screen is super smooth and games do not generally lag. Compared to Samsung 8 inches tablet vs iPad mini, the iPad mini is over 100 grams lighter and therefore the better option.",
            "It's great I should've purchased the 256 gb variant because we can't delete cache and extra data created by the apps so we have to delete them and reinstall again to clear extra data I recommend you all to buy a 256 gb variant if you need more space on your ipad",
            "In previous I thought that Apple devices are not value for money. Only designed for Premium users but when I bought my first apple device IPad mini 5 it changes the way to think about Apple brand. After using my iPad continuously 18 days I can say that every Apple device worth its price tag. It\u2019s performance beyond my imagination. And I can play any game like pro . Too much cool display and high performance.",
            "Very light weight , perfect size and very good for reading ebooks.\nMost of YouTube videos playing on it have problem with the aspect ratio.\nScreen quality is good with max 1080 videos, Brightness level is good and having no issues with outdoor usage.\nAudio is not that loud, my OnePlus phone is much louder than this.\nTouch is very responsive. Finger print also works well.\nipadOS 13.1.2 update brings its capabilities to multitask, open multiple windows and otg support.\nSome of the demerits is for users coming from Android as it has sandboxing, so inter app level file cannot be shared ,for eg. PDF files downloaded from telegram, WhatsApp cannot be seen by Adobe reader. File manager can access only the files saved to it using iTunes. and so on.\n\nOverall nice product to use",
            "Awesome i love it better than 6th generation. Best for pubg players. HDR. Ultra. And direct live stream pubg no lag.",
            "Absolute Power house with portability in Mind. I had ordered it in May 13th and received on 17th May. Intially I bought it for media consumption and other some College Works , but I went for a tour next week where I found it portability comes to a great extent. I Intially used for music and movies during journey and occasionally some photos during tour and to my surprise Pics also came excellent due to A12 Chipset and It also handle any game out their in App store.

But the optimisations, the things it gets done at this price point while being so compact makes it worth the asking price. Even in 2nd quarter of 2021.

I'll justify my opinion below:\n\nDisplay: The first big CON for entertainment and gaming. The display is an LCD display and as you all know it is not as good as Samsung's amoled displays.

The display is good but not excellent like an OLED, the ios is awsome,this was the first time I have been to the ios ecosystem, was an android user for the several years. Coming to the usability criterion I mainly use this as a media consumption device and for occasional reading for this purpose the device is exceptional. Apps are great and is seamlessly integrated to work with the a power packed hardware. Camera is little okay but serves the purpose never mind u won't buy a tab for its camera.
