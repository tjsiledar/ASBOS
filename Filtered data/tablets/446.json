Although it gives HD+high fps the performance is really a beast..\nThe speakers are lovely with dolby atmos support the sound quality is crystal clear and bass is also good\nIf your needs match with my one then this is the best tab for u go for it..",
            "Awesome Tablet\nBought on offer time @ price of Rs. 13000 /-\nI have 4gb RAM 64gb Storage\nReview after 10 Days\n1. Great Performance\n2. Great Battery Back for 2 days after medium uses\n3. Great Specification at this price range\n4. Much better than lenovo Tablet\n5. One thing is missing if there is any inbuilt stand or holding thing like lenovo yoga tab 3\n6. Camera quality also good.\n7. Resolution is 1080p\n8. Sound quality amazing with Dolby sound software\n9. Earphone sound quality and speaker sound quality both are awesome.\n10. Battery optimization System is very good. When tablet in idle mode battery not draining\n11. You can manage app setting as per your requirement like auto on, notification, battery optimization etc",
            "Model : 4/64GB\n\nDisplay (3/5) : Not great, but good enough for browsing, studying. Just ok for movies. Not enough contrast for my liking.\n\nBuild (4/5) : Build quality is good but the Tab slips away from hand like butter, better buy a case and screen protector ASAP.\n\nSensors (3/5) : No ambient light sensor, so no auto brightness. Auto rotation, GPS, Bluetooth are there.\n\nSound (4/5) : There is no stand-alone dolby app like many other tablets/phones. Dolby is embedded into system settings so limited settings I feel. Sound modes of music and smart mode are alike and have good dialogue clarity. Movie mode gives excellent surround sound with a slight compromise in dialogue clarity while watching movies. Sound is loud enough for group watching. In earphones, all modes seem identical with slight surround affect in movie mode. Volume is also on lower side in earphones. (Tested on 1more triple driver in-ear headphones.)\n\nPerformance (3/5) : Good for browsing and moderate tasks, felt no lag till now. It is smooth but not fast. File system used is F2FS.\n\nBattery (4/5) : Good enough for a whole day with moderate use. I got 10 hours of screen on time with moderate use.\n\nInterface (3/5) : Though latest Pie is given, I feel there are limited customisations. Still smooth UI.\n\nCamera (2/5) : Didn't use much but still the samples are of below average quality.\n\nOverall I got what I required. Perfect for my needs - reading, browsing and some movie watching with great surround sound, though you need supported content to get surround experience.",
            "I bought 8inch 64gb variant.. Good tab in this price range.. but one major problem is, there is no speaker for voice calling.. we have to connect headphones or else we should talk in loud speaker..other than that display quality is very good.. good for reading and watching movies.. mainly very useful for office peoples to do things like presentation and other kind of document works.. overall worth of money",
            "A fortunate buy since I found out about it completely by accident.\n\nI decided to get a tab after four years of using solely an Android phone, and the Android Tablet scene has changed drastically since then. We always seemed to be compromising something for another: If you have a good display, then the camera is terrible. If you have both a good camera and display, then battery backup is underwhelming.\n\nI almost bought an iPad despite my many inhibitions regarding Apple\u2019s compatibility issues.\n\nBut then this new model caught my eye. This tab ticked all the right boxes and at a fantastic price.\n\nI bought the 4 GB variant because I knew this would face heavy usage. I chose the 8 inch simply because of the front camera which is 8 MP compared to the 10.1 inch\u2019s 2 MP.\n\nI don\u2019t use this tab for calling since I find tablets in general too inconvenient for that purpose, but I do use Whatsapp with this. For voice calls, either use your earphones/headphones or the loud speaker. Some of you may find that a dealbreaker, but it wasn\u2019t even a blip in my radar.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a fully-featured tab for daily usage, like office work or occasional gaming, I\u2019d recommend this tab. Worth the cost in every way.",
            "The best tab in mid range. It comes with a sleek metal body and has a good in hand feel. I've got the 3 gb ram version. It's good enough for normal usage even PUBG runs lag free on HD settings.Awesome battery backup. The 8 inch screen is suitable to read and watch movies the viewing angles are quite good for the price. It's got stereo speakers and the audio is decent and I do dislike the fact that it's got no calling speaker.",
            "This product is really very good\nvalue for money i have orderd 4 gb 64 gb varient\nthis is good for pubg my experience of pubg is very smooth in hd\nbattery backup is good\ncamera quality is good\nscreen size and bulit quality is great\nhd screen is awesome",
            "I bought honor pad 5 befor one month and the experience was very bad... Medical students Don't dare to buy this tab... Bcoz it doesn't support maximum medical applications... Always say close the app..\n\nProblems are = lagging, not support \u00d72, \u00d71.5 video speed for application like marrow and prepladder...",
            "I bought the 3gb ram/ 32 gb storage variant, 8 inch.\nThis is the best tab in this price segment.\nGaming performance is smooth( I play asphalt 8). Size is perfect. U can hold in one hand, and work with other hand. Processor is Kirin 710 which is better than Kirin 659 in 10 inch tab.\nSound is superb.",

Sound modes of music and smart mode are alike and have good dialogue clarity. Movie mode gives excellent surround sound with a slight compromise in dialogue clarity while watching movies. Sound is loud enough for group watching. In earphones, all modes seem identical with slight surround affect in movie mode. Volume is also on lower side in earphones. (Tested on 1more triple driver in-ear headphones.)\n\nPerformance (3/5) : Good for browsing and moderate tasks, felt no lag till now. It is smooth but not fast. File system used is F2FS.\n\nBattery (4/5) : Good enough for a whole day with moderate use. I got 10 hours of screen on time with moderate use.\n\nInterface (3/5) : Though latest Pie is given, I feel there are limited customisations. Still smooth UI.\n\nCamera (2/5) : Didn't use much but still the samples are of below average quality.\n\nOverall I got what I required. Perfect for my needs - reading, browsing and some movie watching with great surround sound, though you need supported content to get surround experience.",
            "I bought 8inch 64gb variant.. Good tab in this price range.. but one major problem is, there is no speaker for voice calling.. we have to connect headphones or else we should talk in loud speaker..other than that display quality is very good.. good for reading and watching movies.. mainly very useful for office peoples to do things like presentation and other kind of document works.. overall worth of money",
            "A fortunate buy since I found out about it completely by accident.\n\nI decided to get a tab after four years of using solely an Android phone, and the Android Tablet scene has changed drastically since then. We always seemed to be compromising something for another: If you have a good display, then the camera is terrible. If you have both a good camera and display, then battery backup is underwhelming.\n\nI almost bought an iPad despite my many inhibitions regarding Apple\u2019s compatibility issues.\n\nBut then this new model caught my eye. This tab ticked all the right boxes and at a fantastic price.\n\nI bought the 4 GB variant because I knew this would face heavy usage. I chose the 8 inch simply because of the front camera which is 8 MP compared to the 10.1 inch\u2019s 2 MP.\n\nI don\u2019t use this tab for calling since I find tablets in general too inconvenient for that purpose, but I do use Whatsapp with this. For voice calls, either use your earphones/headphones or the loud speaker. Some of you may find that a dealbreaker, but it wasn\u2019t even a blip in my radar.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a fully-featured tab for daily usage, like office work or occasional gaming, I\u2019d recommend this tab. Worth the cost in every way.",
            "The best tab in mid range. It comes with a sleek metal body and has a good in hand feel. I've got the 3 gb ram version. It's good enough for normal usage even PUBG runs lag free on HD settings.Awesome battery backup. The 8 inch screen is suitable to read and watch movies the viewing angles are quite good for the price. It's got stereo speakers and the audio is decent and I do dislike the fact that it's got no calling speaker.",

Sharing some of the pics to help you all understand settings for kids. Go through it and happy purchase.",
            "Well everything with this tablet is good except that it does not support Volte, which means that it does not have Jio support directly... However having said that Jio can still run on this tablet via Jio call application under MyJio app. Which drains atleast 15% more battery.\n\nI have still given this a five star as it really stands out of the compitition.

All Google apps are available. I got it for Rs. 10,800/- under flipkart /SBI joint offer. Delivery is not good due to flipkart sale. I extended my tab memory by adding one 64 gb SDHC Samsung memory card. Over all excellent tab. Please add one back cover, as the tablet back is very slippery. The tab is not gorilla glass, so, becareful. Previously, I used two 7\" and 8\" tabs of Dell and Lenovo. It is much better than those used earlier. Thank you.",

It has a full hd display and excellent for entertainment, reading and games. Battery backup is excellent. On a full charge, the battery lasts up to 3 days. Audio quality is good, it has dual stereo speakers with Dolby surround sound. The front and back camera is decent. Tablet is not ideal if you prefer to use it for calling as it lacks earpiece . Few things that i felt that its really missing out is on ambient light sensor and finger print sensor.",

            "A budget Android tablet that is really worth it. Decent mid range processor, adequate storage with SD card expansion option, 4GB RAM which makes multitasking much more responsive, a special UI for tablets which while it is still an Huawei mod on Android is still quite lightweight and responsive. The typical bloatware which seeks a number of permissions is irritating, but most of them can be disabled if not uninstalled completely. The touch response is excellent, the screen is big enough to be immersive for content consumption, viewing angles and resolution and colour reproduction are good, the top and bottom firing dual speakers aren't the loudest but do a good job with sound quality, the battery optimisations are excellent and charging is reasonably fast, and it's not too heavy. All in all, excellent for as an entertainment, social media and productivity device. Good job Honor!!!",

Camera is good for online chatting and video calling purposes but can't compare it with moblie if you are using the high quality selfie camera mobile like Oppo or vivo..\n6.

It charges from 10 percent to 100 percent in about 2 hours. The battery lasts about 2 days. It also has a very good screen recorder feature which I use to record my school meetings and my games.

So they mush have to give a quite good adapter instead this.\nThe product is very fragile so, make sure having a flip back cover ordering together.\nOtherwise it's a low budget pad ,so don't have more expectations.\nI bought this for my clinic, To use Homoeopathic Reportery.and it does good work.",

Like Samsung it cannot provide updates continuously. Samsung Galaxy a 10.1 released in Feb 2019 and got 10 update. This tab released mid of 2019 and struck at 9. No news on updates, no ware in internet you find at least support page for this device,, Better go with Samsung Tabs according to your budget.\n\nRs. 17000 for this 8 inch tab is a waste investment compared with Rs. 13500 for Samsung Galaxy tab a 10.1... (Though it is 2GB, it cannot be compared with Huawei 4GB tab in terms of performance, premium look) Suggestion is \"AVOID HUAWIE\"...........Choice is yours",

            "What are you buying?\n\nAn big android phone with 8.0 screen called tablet\n\nDo you want to game?\n\ngo for it , pubg runs fine , cod mobile runs fine except some lags in the 50 or 100 player(on the island survival mode) but it may be , because the game is new and devs are trying fix bugs. Asphalt legends runs fine . You can't do fortnight though.\n\nDo you want to read on it?\n\nyes this is great for reading. i have a kindle too ,it won't beat kindle but the reading mode and the moon plus reader application (playstore) ,make it very pleasing to the eyes. If you buy it for reading ,do download moon plus reader for its versatility to read the book ,make notes , highlight and bunch of features.\n\nyou are a camera enthusiast?\ndon't give me that ,i won't buy it , who buys a tablet for camera?camera is just okay ,i mean you can capture photos , face recognition works fine except when the light is low . Though Don't compare it to any smartphone. It does not even stand up to my 2 year old nubia z17 mini.\n\nwanna do multitasking?\nThis is good for multitasking. if you are into making notes and switch back and forth to google chrome. You may try to use google docs ,it is good .\n\nBattery?\n\nbattery is the best thing about this tablet. It dies really slowly , optimization is awesome . And the fact that it has a built in screen time activity analyser, it would help you to be more productive .i loved it.\n\nscreen?\nscreen is decent too . Though it could be better, I would say 4.327 out of 5.you van also tweak color settings.\n\nsecurity ?\nyou got face unlock ,pin,pattern ,file hider, app locker, child protection.\n\nduring the sale i bought it for 14000 ,4gb ram,64gbrom. a steal deal.\nyou can buy cause nothing is better in this price segment as of now.",
            "This is the best performing tablet with eye comfort mode. I bought it for my 3 yr old child and she is enjoying the educational games and videos on its 8 inch screen. However I had to purchase tempered glass and back cover separately and those are quite expensive.",

            "Battery is ok bu charging time is extremely high nearly 5 hrs\nTop menu drag is sluggish. Maybe the ui is not optimized because it handles almost games including Asphalt 9 smoothly.\nJio sims have compatibility problem. It will show the tower and all but calls can't be placed or received. Need to use jiocall app for voice calling even. With jio call the problem is you always need to connect to jio data, if you switch over to wifi again call functionality would be disabled. This is a real problem.\nThis problem does not occur with other sims. I tested with Airtel and Vodafone both worked well.\nGood quality cases are not available for this tab. I bought a generic case from TGK but rear camera hole was not placed properly so had to return it.\nOverall it is a decent tab for watching movies and playing games. Its better than the 10 inch version as the soc and camera both are better.",

            "Such a device is subjective to one's requirements.\nI needed a bare basic device for browsing, streaming and video calls. NO GAMING / PHOTOGRAPHY AT ALL. And as such this Tab packs quite a punch.\n\nBattery backup is a concern. But my device is always at home and right next to the power source so this is covered. Expect 6 to 8 hours at best with Normal use.\n\nDisplay is great however Outdoor usage is out of the door.\n\nI don't usually deal in data transfer at all so basic Micro USB port is ok for me. I'd have preferred a USB C Port.\n\nBuild quality is great. 8 inc. form factor is really great for handling.\n\nAudio quality is boosted due to dual speakers. Very balanced and quite satisfying.\n\nKirin 710 turns out to be a more than capable horse and it easily carried the load.\n\nOverall, as I stated earlier, for basic functions this is an unparalleled device as of Mar 2021.",

Ui is good and fluid, it has remained the same ever since i got it, haven't received any major updates. I haven't played any games on it so cant comment on gaming performance, but day to day apps work flawlessly. My use case doesn't make me push it particularly hard to its limits of performance, but performance in general os good.
