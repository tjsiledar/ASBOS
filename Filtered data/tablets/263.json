            "Hi one and all\nI hope this is the best tablet under budget.\nBefore buying this tablet I thought about phablet like lenovo , MI MAX even MI MIX) but after bought my assumption is Phablet is never be tablet.\nCalling facility 5*\nHandling Phone simply superb\nPerformance excellent\nInternet and videos simply soft\nSound quality good\nAll the specification are very good and working well.\nI'm not a gamer so I don't think memory and internal storage is quite good.all things are very good except camera(flash be useful for low light time).\nA BIG thanks to Flipkart and its team, to satisfy its customers all the while.",
            "In Feb-2016 I purchased this tablet from Reliance Digital. . After 6 months, battery deteriorated. It use to drain very fast. Since within warranty Samsung Service Centre replaced it and now it lasts upto 3 days. I use the tablet almost everyday. I am very much satisfied with its performance. Following are my observations:\n\nDisplay - Very good\nBattery life - Now Excellent\nPerformance - Excellent\nBoth Cameras - Average\nUpdates received upto - Android 6.0.1\n4G/LTE - Yes , Jio Sim works only for data, for jio ca\u013aing/sms relevent jio apps are reqd\n\nInstead of using a android Smartphone , I feel it is more convenient to use tablet like this one becoz of its large screen and superb performance.",
            "Have this tab for 2 days. happy with it. went for this tab only due to the screen's aspect ratio which is 4:3, looks big. battery drains fast i mean with full charge it would only last for 12 hrs with reading and video watching, have not tried games yet. but iam sure it wont last 12 hrs if one played games.though it isexpelled from the really gud for reading and watching videos. my 2yr old loves it. please dont expect really big out of this tab, go for 20k plus tabs if want better performance. i dont really trust lenovo so i didnt purchase it, otherwise specwise lenovo tab4 8 and tab4 8 plus may be gud. again these may have issues with battery and other h/w later. again i may b wrong with my predictions. so choise is your's. best of luck.",
            "This is one of the good tablet out there at sub 20k segment..I got it at 15.5k..Although it is not the best tablet I have seen however it is perfect for daily usage for any normal users(If you are not an Ipad freak/geek)..\n\nProduct Review:.\nPros:\n1.Samsung Ui.. it received android nougat 7.1 update within 3-4 hrs of purchase.. It is snappy & with multiple uses with split screen, night reading etc.\n2.Sound quality is good.\n3.battery is moderately good. Runs for a day easily with 7-8 hrs screen time.\n4.Design-Sleek and gives a nice feeling on hand.\n5.Overall experience -Samsung never disappoints in this segment. it is user friendly. easy to use. less bugs... smooth ui.. best budget friendly tab for me.. (Tab A 2017 is slightly bttr but it costs 2.4k more).\n6.Connectivity (wifi+mobile data) is good.\n\nCons:\n1.Display is good. not the best.It is just ok.\n2.charging time is 2.5-3.5 hrs. So buy a good charger 1st.\n3.Internal memory(roughly 9gb available). this is a common problem for most tabs.. Buy a 32/64gb memory card.\n\nVerdict :If you are looking for an android tablet at sub 20k segment go for this one. If you can spend 21-22k go for ipad instead..\n\nthanks",

            "Certainly an awesome product. Performance is above par considering the RAM. Handy, excellent for watching Videos, Movies and Reading PDFs. Battery life is OK. Camera though not great not bad either; one can't complain given the price. At a lower price, one might get Honor Mediapad of the same configuration however, that won't be worth it. Also, the camera is useless.",
            "Super tablet very very very nice when I am bought it was very nice and performance is pretty good and it is the good gaming tablet very nice Samsung galaxy tab a t355y",
            "Very good product from Samsung. 8 inch screen looking big.\nOnly cons.is the speaker quality..it's very low but with earphone or headphone it's work best.very sleek and lightweight design\nDisplay quality:. 4/5\nBattery baackup: 4.5/4\nPerformance. : 4/5\nLooks. :5/5\nCamera. :3/5\nVery good product in this price range.go for it guys.",
            "i bought tab A 1 week ago for my dad, so he can read and can function in much better way. i bought this tab a from local store for just 15800. i would say worth buying it. if some one says its camera quality is not so good then i would say that its a tab. yup jio sim supports lte. and yup it does not support volte, and for that jio is providing you app. all over would say if you are thinking to buy it the just go on.",
            "I am using this tab for last 1.5 year i did not find any issue camera quality is good work faster android new version 6.0.1 automatically update .it support jio sim you can use jio net and call also. Jio video calling quality good from front camera...happy to using this thank you",
            "It is a good tab..i have gifted to my mother . Se is very happy with its performance.My 4 years old son is watching lot of you tube videos.The tab is effectively used and rendering satisfactory performance",
            "Well, i was looking for atleast 3GB RAM version but i could only find this one for 16500 budget with 2GB RAM. I was not confident about the speed but i see that its pretty fast and works well with multi tasking.\nThere is definitely a bit of LAG if you are an extensive user but if you are a moderate user then this is definitely a good product for you.\n\nAs usual FLIPKART was very fast in delivering and professional with their part.",
            "This tab I used for a very short time with Jio SIM. It worked fine both for calling, whatsapp, browsing and email. In July I changed the SIM to another Jio SIM.\nThe problem started from the same moment. The 'Call ended' problem persists till this moment. I took it to local Samsung care. He couldn't set it right. Twice I reset it to factory reset. Several times I reset it to default. I did all that I could to take help from online resources. But to no use. It's now lying useless. Rs.14999 are gone to guttur.\nI don't know whether the mistake is with the tablet or with the Jim network. But the same Jim SIM works so well in other phones.\nIt's internet features are working perfectly. I don't know how such products are sold by flipkart. I wonder what products are manufactured by Samsung Mobiles.\nI advise other buyers to not buy it lest they suffer like me.",
            "Honestly I bought it for the study purpose only. Screen ratio 4:3 is superb, good for study. I charge it rarely, means good battery backup, if you are using it for study purpose. Don't look for the camera performance, it's tab. Happy with the ram management. Screen resolution could be better.",
            "this tablet is good camera is also ok with 2 mp and 5mp the battery is good the performance is good but the 1st time the sim slot not working",

            "this tablet is value for money, I get it in festive offer at RS 11999, camera is like all tablets front and rear, speed is good, screen(touch) is smooth, good at gaming and study purposes. battery is 4200 that is pretty descent but charging is slow. sound is good with one speaker at down side. 4.5 \ud83c\udf1f for tablet and 3 \ud83c\udf1f for delivery.....they took ten days to deliver even one day later than mentioned date",
            "Nice Tab . Reasonable pricing. Performance strong. Inbuilt memory could have been more enhanced. Also the complimentary earphones could have been provided in the package.\nOverall a fairly good buy at descent discount in the 'Big Billion' sale.",

            "I have purchased the product first time from flipkart. After receiving the product, I felt that the screen resolution is not that good, the texts were obscure. So i placed the product for the return. But they didn't accept it. It is nothing but the pressurising the customer to keep the product. other service providers don't do this. so I am completely disappointed with Flipkart.",
            "Its a 8\" smartphone nothing else not 4G, it is LTE, HSPA+, do not support reliance jio sim, i used it on 3G which results in heating between volume button and camera after 1 to 2 hr depends on network speed which may be normal.\n\nOverall ok if you are using for just surfing, and reading.

            "Product is worth the price. I am using it since for one year and I mainly use it for my academic purposes. In that regard the size of the screen itself is a boon. Display is good. Battery life is quite satisfactory. Somehow the camera us not that good. Touch is smooth and I have not encountered any single incident of hanging or any such problem for which Samsung is typical abuses for. Single sim slot is a major disadvantage if this device.",
