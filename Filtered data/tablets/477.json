            "Has 2gb ram , marshmallow. Screen quality is nice . Great battery life and never got heated up all the time I have been using. Good product.",
            "Excellent product and very good experience with lenevo tab. Display is bright and color reproduction is very rich. Sound seems to be bit moderate in open speaker mode, but good when used with earphone. Android 6.0 is refreshing... overall satisfied with performance till date. Only could not locate flip cover for this tab..hope to find one soon.",
            "Good tablet. Writing review after a month usage. Good tablet for children. I got this for my daughter. I set up multiuser profile. In kids profile I can control what app , when and how long to use. Different screen setting for standard, movie and reading saves eye from irritation. Default warm screen for kids profile helps child to read without tiring eyes. Scheduled on off feature helps to save battery too. Charging takes quiet a while. But last long for a week end trip.",
            "I bought this 4 days before the big billion sale, got a sweet deal. Flipkart made super fast delivery in less than 20 hours.\nNow regarding the tablet, my main motive for purchasing this was for reading books, and little casual entertainment when travelling. I must say reading book is a delight on this tablet, it has an effective reading mode (An option in Adaptive Display, also Moon Reader + is a good app), full HD videos play without any lag.\nCharging is fast. The reason I selected this tablet over others is simply that it has 2GB RAM, with 8 inch screen which no one else provided in this price range.\nDisplay is vivid and clear. Regarding the build quality, nothing out of the world, it feels ok to hold, nothing premium nor cheap plastic feel, but no complains considering its price..\nIt doesn't have a Sim slot, this was not my concern as I have no intention of using an 8 inch phone, it looks weird to talk with such a huge screen.\nIt's a good entry level tablet I can say, and one can opt for this confidently.",
            "got it at 7199, 1k off + 799 axis bank offer. tab is fantastic.\n1. a bit heavy.\n2. feels sturdy n grips well while holding.\n3. battery performs well under moderate usage for 6-7 hrs.\nworth buying..",
            "Pretty decent for the price of 5.4k which I paid during the offer period. Battery is amazing. The rest of the specs are in line with its price. The software is close to stock Android and the Handy features like kid mode, various display modes and dolby sound are useful.\n\nThe only con is this slowly clocked 1Ghz processor. Hence it is not suitable for heavy work such as graphic intensive games. Ideal for reading, browsing, videos and as a study companion for students.",
            "Best Tab Under 10K\n\nDon't trust the negative reviews about this tab. It is a great tab in every respect :\n\nSuperb Build Quality\n\nFantastic Display. Absolutely perfect clear viewing from any angle, no contrast or colour shift. Very soothing to eye also.\n\nSpectacular 360degree surrounding Dolby sound effect from the two front facing speakers. You will not believe this until you hear the sound shifting from left speaker to right.\n\nMarshmallow without any bloatware.\n\nGreat Battery life.\n\nWell , seems like I am writing propaganda for lenovo. But these are facts. Trust my words. I am very happy with my purchase.",
            "First of all , the product was timely delivered. No surprise here. Thanks to flipkart delivery system.\nNow, considering the price this Lenovo tab 3 8 is a really satisfying product. Though it's 1GHz processor is a little underpowered but the 2gb of ram successfully covers the drawback. Very smooth multitasking performance. Touch is responsive enough. Display is sufficient. If you are a high resolution smartphone user then you may feel some disappointed but considering the price it's sufficient.\nBattery is a boon. Single charge lasts for a whole day of multitasking. Charging is also quite fast.\nAll apps are working. Kids mode is a new thing to discover and could give a benefit. Heavy games are working quite well. Night reading becomes comfortable with the adaptive display.\nOverall value for money and definitely wouldn't disappoint you at least it doesn't for me.",
            "Writng this review after 2 years if usage. Best for....literally everything. The system is very fast and have yet not recieved any complaints. Excelent storage capacity. Great live backgrounds, lighting, security system and fits in smallest to smallest of places. Loking for a TAB, go for this because it is an efficient and a totally worth it product.",
            "If you are looking for a basic tab and if you will use it for browsing and reading pdf documents on the go then this is the right tab for you. Sound quality is quite good with duel speakers. Screen quality is acceptable for indoor use. Screen brightness is not adequate for outdoor use. You can't expect anyting from a tablet camera. I don't use it for gaming. You can use it for watching youtube videos in 720p. Using it for several months without any proboem.\nRegards\nAnkur",

            "Got this tablet after two days of placing an order. Faster delivery from Ekart. I had ordered Wi-Fi only version for 6k. I am writing this review after two weeks of usage.\nPros:\n- Nice Screen and nice colour reproduction.\n- Good sound quality as it having dolby atmos feature.\n- 2 GB RAM.\n- Back side texture is very nice. It cannot slip from hands easily.\n- Short Edges at both side left and right. Built quality is ok as at the edges it shaped like \u201cJ\u201d i. e. screen is bit small on top and not equal to back cover. So, there is some pain on fingers.\n- Front camera is good for video calling on Skype, etc. but have some problem in low light.\n- Tablet charges fast takes about two and half hours for full charge.\n- Good battery backup. I have activated battery optimiser tablet runs two days of moderate usage.\n- Good for reading books and watching movies in bigger screen.\nCons:\n- Does not support USB OTG that is very essential for tablets as per my opinion.\n- 3.5mm audio jack is not universal, I cannot use all headphones only nokia and Philips is supporting as I have checked.\n- 1 GHz mediatek processor.\n- Can\u2019t play high end games. I can\u2019t play GTA vice city.\n- Touch not much responsive at the corners.\n- No screen protection. Even tablet does not come with factory screen guard and not tempered glass or screen guard available in market.\n- No flash at back camera.",
            "It is an amazing product. The price is just too good for the whole package. I purchased it for reading ebooks and magazines and it serves the purpose like a charm. The only downside - Accessories not available. I would so much love to have a flip book cover but sadly there is nothing available. Even the screen guard has to be modified of other brand and fitted in.\n\nOther and a very weird downside. It does not accept any other memory card than Transcend. Transcend is expensive and that is there you take a hit of about 1k. But still overall it remains an impressive package. Go for it.",
            "I find product searching easy in flipcart compared to any other shopping sites or tools. The tablet quality is good. Flipcart delivery is excellent. Overall good performance.",
            "I'm writing a review after using this product for 1 week. Got this for 5999rs on 12 Dec 2016 and got delivered in 2 days. The packing was very good and the product was a brand new sealed one.\nIn the box- 1 tablet piece,a charger,a USB cable, user manual and 1year warranty card\nWhat all I expected but didn't have- an otg cable(I still haven't checked if it supports otg) , screen guard\n\nSince there is no available of screen guard and flip cover for this model u can purchase any 8 inch screen guard and an 8 inch universal flip cover as I have done and it fits perfectly!!\n\nSpecs- all the things given in the product description is true. Please note that this model is wi-fi only tablet.\n\n\u2206The tablet actually looks very good than from the picture. The tablet back is black and has a grainy texture which feels very good in hand and gives nice grip for this big tablet.\n\n\u2206The back cover is not removable as well as the battery.\n\n\u2206The back and front cameras are above average. But that's just enough for a tab!\n\n\u2206the best thing are the dual front speakers. They have a decent loudness and actually provides a good surround effect while watching movie or playing games. This uses a dolby system for sound equilizer and effects. The dolby provides a professional inbuilt equilizer.\n\n\u2206 another cool feature is the adaptive display with 4 modes! It changes the display settings and sound output according to the app opened. If you open a ebook for reading it automatically changes to reading more and when you open a movie or a game it switches to media mode .\n\n\u2206another feature is the child mode where you can control the app used by the child and also the time.\n\n\u2206 I used a 8gb SD card and it's working fine. U can make it as internal memory or just a removable memory! Cool feature from android marshmallow.\n\n\u2206 the 2 GB ram management is very good. It always provide 1.2gb free ram good for multitasking.\n\n\u2206 the battery backup is exceptionally excellent!! I used it like 3 days without charging which included gaming , reading etc. Very cool!!\n\n\u2206the internal memory is 16. Only 12.5gb is available for user. Also u can increase internal memory using an external SD card.which is a very good feature .\n\n\u2206 I'm a hardcore gamer. And have played graphics intensive games like asphalt 8 , gangstar, modern combat, clash of clans etc. All the games run very smooth without anl6 lags or freezing. Thanks to 2 GB ram and 1ghz clock is just enough!\n\nOverall I'm very much satisfied with this lenovo tab! The main point is that lenovo is a well reputed brand and the build quality of the product is very good . Feel free to buy the decent priced tab with these much good specs. You won't regret buying it. ;)",
            "Ordered on 5th June and got on 7th June so very fast delivery by ekart. Full marks on that\n\nPros\nGood display\nRead Mode is good for reading as it automatically turns on the yellow tint which is good for eyes\nMedia mode make media experience awesome\nThere's also a kid Mode which I don't use\nBattery life is good. Saw movie whole night and still 40% battery was still left\nCame with a screen guard already on tab\nDolby sound is powerful but not very great\nAlmost stock Android experience which is good than having other softwares\nGot many frills in low budget\nIt's a WiFi only tab, not calling, so good for me\nWiFi is fast\n\nCons\nScreen size looks smaller than 8 inch due to edges\nTouch gets irresponsive many times\nNo Android updates available\nNo otg cable with tab. Have to buy separately\nApps don't get installed on SD card nor you can transfer them to SD card. You can transfer files from your PC or laptop to SD card.\nOtg support not very smooth. Tab didn't recognize my otg device.\n\nMy verdict\nI wanted tab for watching pre downloaded movies or online videos and reading stuff, which the tab does perfectly well.\nI didn't want a calling tab but tab with good display and WiFi, which is satisfied.\nI will say it's value for money in this price range as it offers smooth Android experience, very good battery life and display. But not good for heavy gaming purpose or heavy networking purposes. I am satisfied with both flipkart and lenovo",
            "The product is good compared to other available options at the price point. I got it for 5500 and it worth more than that. 2gb ram, atmos sound ideal size. This is WiFi only model",
            "A steal for 5999\nIt a decent tab for the discounted price of 5999 but certainly not for the original price of 10k.\n\nThe cons\n- slightly on the slower side but responsive none the less.\n- screen saturation and color reproduction aren't accurate.\n- screen isn't very crisp either\n- the camera is quite bad indoors and outdoors(but who cares about a tablet camera). Front is just good enough for video calls.\n- no blue light filter mode - forgodsake it's a tab, why isn't there a reading mode, installed a different app for it.\n\nThe pros\n- the UI is quite smooth being almost close to stock android provided you turn off the animations and stuff.\n- pretty decent multi tasking with decent ram management.\n- easy to hold and type.\n- easy to carry around.\n- decent build quality.\n- looks like a quality product.\n- stereo speakers are decent. Not loud but decent. I would've loved better audio quality though through the headphones..",
            "Good tablet with good moderate speed. sound is good but volume is low. Memory card 32GB samsung gets supported. wifi reception is excellent. High internal memory and ram for apps. Fast charging less than 2.5 hours for full charge and good battery backup. Overall value for money",
            "The display ain't razor share but its the best in the class the contrast ratio the saturation the viewing angles everythings perfect!\nThe battery life is Super awesome the best i've had on any tablet i've ever used only con i could say is the processor.\n1ghz processor is not powerful enough to play heavy games.",
            "My son who is in class seventh is using this product for last two months.\n\nProduct quality is really good looking at price point. Objective was only to provide a device to be used for study and purpose is getting solved in low cost.\n\nScreen, though is 8inch, but is really big enough, it look like three times bigger than my 6inch mobile. My mobile screen look child in front of this tab.\n\nWhatsApp installation was not working, but worked after OS update (default update, nothing new was required). .\n\nI like the multi profile option. I have created separate profile for my child and blocked application installation, you tube etc in child profile. My son can only use whatever app I have allowed in child profile. He doesn't know parent (admin) profile password, so safety thing is taken care.\n\nAlso, I like the feature where we can set the uverall usage allowed. So, if you set the allowed duration of only 2 hours from within window of 9am to 7pm, then system doesn't allow login if any of this criteria is fulfilled for the day for that profile.\n\nBattery backup looks good enough for study.\n\nOverall, happy with the device and it meets my requirements.",
            "its a nice tab incredible battery life super clarity display and sound",
            "Okay so this is everything for an avid reader. It supports everything and also has a high battery back up. Secondly, the screen is of 8 inches and so you can also enjoy films.",
            "Amazing product using for my office work and it work fantastic. Camera is good but not as much as i expected. But overall performance of this tablet is great.",
            "As far as design ...its eye catching ,looks up market .......performance is good for multitasking and low end games ........display is amazing for the price .......the sound is crisp and clear thanx to Dolby atmos.........go for it....you'll not regret it",
            "As usual flipkart delivered before time and the tab is very good value for money. Very good wifi reception and kids are enjoying kind of games on the tab. Hassle free usage and customer friendly. Would highly recommend it.",
            "This tab in comparison with other currently available tabs is good. It has 2 gb ram though you get a WiFi only version. The operation is smooth. Ideal for kids, students and travellers. Has a good battery backup as well. And the sound is good.",
            "The best one can get at the given price. Battery backup is good enough. Screen resolution n Dolby Atmos is really good experience. Screen touch sensitivity is also good Enough..howevr its been jst a week since the tab is delivered..hope all ths experiences remains the same on the long run. Budget tab!!!",
            "RAM could have been improved to at least 3GB\nROM also should have been 32 GB\nScreen resolution also could have been better\nOtherwise a decent tab for the price, and the best in this range as of now",
            "A good device for normal usr. Running smooth. Good battery, awesome build quality and responsiveness. Not blazingly fast! Screen resolution is avg. I got it for 7k and now it's available for 6k. I love the device.",
            "I bought this on 5th December and was delivered on 6th december. Totally value for money tab as I got it for Rs.5399. Good buying experience from Flipkart and a good seller. I have used it for couple of days and found this tab totally worth the money spent. Backside of the tab has rubberised plastic, a good touch from Lenevo. Only negative is that touch is little unresponsive on soft touches i.e. you need to touch it little hard. May be I am not use to it as I use iPhone & Nexus but it will be unfair to compare this tab with those phones.You will not get such good specifications for this price so just go for it.",
            "Amazing product and super value for money. Flipkart's delivery was super fast and product came with proper bubble packing to avoid any damage to it. I would rate the lenovo's tab as the best in that price range and flipkart to be the first choice to buy anything online.",
            "Nice tab gaming speed awesome,browsing is fast nice tab recommend to buy!",
            "it have multiple mode light faster and i got it for only rs .6999,u dont get this type of tab at this affordable price and of a well established brand of lenovo",

Charging time is less (get 80% from 20% in one hour).\n6. A light weight tablet.\n7. Android Marshmallows 6.0.\ncons.:\n1. no led flash.\n2. Processor is only 1GHz(sometimes may appears lag while using multiple applications).\n3. Screen resolution is not upto mark if you are playing high graphics game.(but its ok for reading books and low graphics game.)\n4. Speaker quality is not up to mark.",

            "Good if u r a heavy youtube and internet user, though the touch is a bit unresponsive.. the device lags if you try to run games. Overall its a good device if u r a mild user....if u r a heavy user do not go for this device.\nThe battery is very good, the sound quality is not so good, the display is nice.\nU will feel a bit of unresponsiveness while using it. And sometimes a bit of lag.\nThose trying to buy a tab to play clash of clans, do not go for this device, it lags.",
            "Great tablet.. one of the few tablets having 2gb ram. Got it for 5999 only. Performance, display are good. Battery back up is awesome.\nOnly drawback is that Lenovo does not give any software update.",

Thr 4-Star rating & the following points are strictly keeping the price tag in mind.\nPros:\nGood build quality\nGood speakers\nGood battery life\nAndroid Marshmallow (although, it's 6.0, NOT 6.0.1 or later)\nCons:\nLOW Screen Resolution\n1 GHz Quad Core Mediatek is just ISN'T enough horsepower\nMy two cents - For its regular price of around 9,000 INR, it's better to go for the Mi Pad instead.\nHope this makes you make an informed decision.\nRegards,\nOmkar",
            "Pros:\n2 GB RAM\nMarshmallow (OS)\nBattery(4250 mah)\nPrice : Got it at 5399/- its the best Tablet for This Price\nCons:\nProcessor\nThe Display Sucks ,The Max Brightness Level is Not enough for Outdoor Lightenings and this bothers me a lot while i am in out door",

            "Used Lenovo Tab 3 for almost 2 weeks and Mi pad for more than a Year.\nThe touch and camera of Mi Pad is much better than Lenovo tab. The feel of Mi pad is better though holding Lenovo Tab is more convenient than Mi Pad. If Mi Pad is avalaible I will do for Mi Pad.",
            "i ordered this tablet on 17th aug and received it on 19th morning....so far the tablet is running good...\n\nfirst of all the tablet's name is Tab 3 8 not A8....if u look into lenovo website then u will find only 1 GB RAM version however this one is 2 GB model. To make it clear, this tab is wifi only model....no sim slot option available....using a tab for calling is wierd anyways so its not a problem for me.\n\nAt this price, its the only tab u will get in the market with better brand name and with 2GB ram inside it....\n\nIf u need voice calling then there is Phab from lenovo for that.\n\nNote for Flipkart website maintainers :- please put correct details regarding the devices as these are not cheap items which can be ignored. Also, the product name is wrong. You people corrected the voice calling specs fiasco however the most important thing is the name of tab which creates confusion is still wrong...",
            "U will regret if you buy this tab as 1ghz will always let u down.... Rest is ur choice.. moreover there is also problem in the memory card slot as sometimes failed to identify memory card of 64gb or even 32 GB but 16 GB works very well....",

I think the sellers take a chance by sending these defective products and if the return date is gone they are successful. Lenovo customer care is even worse. This is my second device to have liquid damage.\n\nIGNORE THIS MESSAGE at your own risk!",

I had multiple inquiry to customer care before ordering this product about SIM slot. Executives are unaware they also see their Flip kart web and reply back!!\n\nso Ideally website Designing team should be more cautious about specification before rolling out to customer!!!\n\nUltimately !! Flipkart is losing the trust what it has gained so far !!!",
            "Conned by flipkart. Dont buy this cheap product from a cheap site flipkart, They firstly clearly written in the product description that this tablet supported Dual sim, but this tablet does not supported even a single sim. There is no sim slot. When people tell this to flipkart they have corrected his mistake from product description and now they are delaying the refund. They keep asking more and more time from past 2 weeks to return the amount but they are not returning the money. BEWARE AND DONT BUY FROM FLIPKART. BIG OOOOOOOOO RATING TO FLIPKART.",
            "Flipkart disappointed me this time , the specification & customer executive of flipkart states that it's a voice Calling tab but it doesn't have Sim card option ,\nThier service quality is now deteriorating, flipkart think they are big online gaint , but they will be big sick unit if they will do such kind of acts."
