            "Pro :\n1. Super IPS Display, display quality is awesome..\n2. Amazing Sound, even best of Tablets Misses that quality and quad speaker sound, for Media purpose its an awesome product..\n3. Active stylus is good but lags a bit..\n4. Battery is decent, Not so good nor Bad.\n5. 4G sim working is a good addition + SD card support, as 32/64 GB variant are not enough for storage. so good it has SD Support up to 256 GB\n\nCons :\n1. Very old Android 8.0.0\n2. Even EMUI is 8.0 too old where has new devices are ready with EMUI 10...\n3. Stylus Pen is good addition but lags a bit and has no dedicated In built software for it. Need to install 3rd party apps. But overall a good feature.\n4. \"NO DESKTOP MODE\", I contacted the Huawei and asked how to enable Desktop Mode, They Replied for Indian Version Tablet is not compatible for desktop mode, But International version does, I don't know if an Update could enable it.\n5. Fingerprint button is as per Landscape Mode, so while taking Noted we tend to press it by mistake.\n6. NO Face Unlock as of Now.\n7. No official Keyboard Available.",
            "Ordered this one for my kids, it comes with a pen. Which is very nice and Kids are enjoying it. sone pre-installed apps for kids where to they can do some painting and stuff using pen. I have setup this one with Google kids account which let you control he tab from your phone. Screen clarity is very good, Sound quality is fabulous with the harman kardon speakers and it will give 10 out of 10 for the speaker quality, camera could have been more better. Even though it says fast charging, the charging takes hours to reach 100%. Still I would recommend you too buy this one and with this configuration this would the best price option.",
            "its a great product in this price.. Fast and Good Performance with Good Battery Backup.",
            "Its a pretty good tablet\nGood for media consumption\nOnly compromise is the software, still on Android 8 and emui 8. No hope of getting any update in future too.\nM pen is just fine",
            "nice tablet always wanted a tablet with stylus support good battery life display and speakers overall a nice complete package.",
            "Truth only truth.... Excellent tab..,premium look, Beautiful display, killer battery, audio is a treat to listen, decent processor, camera just OK for normal use, stylus pen works fine, although android 8 but doesn't feel like choppy or laggy...... Played pubg in medium setting--works well..\nPlayed pubg mobile lite---works great..",
            "Value for money and best budget tablet...\nRead my hand written review if you want more...",
            "Pros:\n1. Good touch and stylus response. Though bit slippery when it comes to writing. Good for note taking.\n2. Battery is long lasting. Lasts almost whole day with continuous note taking.\n3. Metal unibody feels premium both on tablet as well as stylus.\n4. Capable of surrounded sound with 4 speakers, absolutely awesome.\n5. Sharp and clear Display. Even though its not 2k.\n6. Perfect budget tablet.\n\nCons:\n1. Camera quality is on the lower side.\n2. 2048 pressure display... Can be on the higher side for drawing.\n3. Bit low on ram.. can be better.. atleast 6Gb. Lags a bit on multi browsing tabs beyond 4.\n4. No update after oreo.\n5. Not sure about the service and spare availability.",
            "Very good tablet considering the price point. Everything works well and have all the bases covered for being a media centric tablet like full hd screen 4 speakers explandable memory and a huge battery with fast charging support.\n\nGiving 4 stars with only 1 con that its software is very old. When phones are getting ready to be updated to android 11, this tab is still on android 8. Considering the price it can be atleast at 9 if not 10.",
            "It's the best Android Tablet in the 20k range. If you are looking for a tablet in this range just go for it. It is perfect for watching lectures, movies, making notes. For note making use Microsoft onenote it works very good and there is no lag of stylus. Camera is not good but front camera is ok for video conferencing etc. Display is very good. Battery performance is also good. After a full charge I was able to use it for 2 days 14 hours with 18% battery remaining, my usage includes 10 hours of Youtube over WiFi, 4 hours of notes reading and 1 hour of leisure activities like updating and all. Tablet receives all the latest android app updates from play store, so you can easily use all the Google services without any hustle and bustle. Although you will not get any software update from Google but security patch is updated regularly with a lag of few months. Currently its running on August 2020 patch. Android is 8.0. EMUI updates will be delivered on time. Stylus works perfectly fine with no lag as such. Stylus is light and easy to handle but if you'll compare it with apple pencil obviously you'll feel the difference. It's a complete package in 20k range.",

            "Nice value for money tablet in the budget. stylus support is a very useful feature for me. just started working with it simply loving the experience...",
            "I am reviewing it after more than one month of use. I have listed the pros and cons bellow\nPros:\n1. The sound output from 4 stereo speaker is just amazing, it can even beat a budget Bluetooth speaker.\n2. Battery life is excellent as it has a 7500 mAh battery\n3. Built quality is also impressive as it has full aluminum body\n4. Screen brightness is very good and auto brightness works good. overall screen quality is good\n5. For reading and media consumption it is perfect\n6. I use it with M pen lite and it works perfectly\n7. As I don't play games, can't say about heavy games but for normal uses, light video and audio editing it works perfect.\n\nCons:\n1. The volume and lock key are not perfectly fitted so it feels like loose.(may be for my device only)\n2. Does not support volte. (only 4G internet can be connected, 3G calling is available)\n3. 3.5mm jack is at left bottom corner, it should be at middle or some what above that because with my cover, I could not use earphone so I have to modify the cover (may not be a problem for other covers)\n5. It is very slippery and heavy so cover is needed otherwise it may fall.\n6. M pen lite should be included along with it in same price.\n\nMore over it is a great product in the price range.",
            "I got this tab on offer for 18400/- , Packing and delivery is good.\n\nCons:\n\nScreen have some uniformity issues, one side it is very bright other side have some screen burning issues. Flipkart will not accept these things as an issue while selling, but in exchange they will say screen has burning issues and can't be taken it.\n\nAlso screen quality is not upto mark as Full HD\n\nDon't expect much from camera, It is like a 2MP\n\nSeems sound is not effective from down speakers\n\nSpeaker grill at bottom side is good, but upside is very sharp and can scratch fingers\n\nSuggestions:\n\nSpeakers are louder, but can be provided side speakers bit more louder instead of Harman brand for a tablet\n\nAlso instead of stylus, could have provided good display and slightly better camera.\n\nThen this would be the best tablet in this segment",
            "I was looking for a stylus supporting tab in 10 inch catagory with descent processing power based on android. After much research i found this product.\n1. Processing is decent\n2. display and touch is flawless\n3. Camera is below average but that is insignificant feature for a tab\n4. Stylus performance is very good\n\nOverall good package in this price for android.\nStylus is provided with tab don't worry",
            "Bought this tablet for internet browsing and my documentation tasks.\nPros-\n1) Big clear display.\n2) Huge 7500mah battery which gives me great screen on time of 10 to 12 hours on moderate use.\n3) USB type C port.\n4) Stylus pen works nicely.\n5) 4g sim card slot available at this price.\n6) one of the best tablet under 25k budget.\n...\nCons-\n1) The biggest con of this tablet is a poor camera. 8mp is equivalent to 2 mp camera quality. Definitely 2mp is batter.\n2) No VoLTE support as of now till july 2020 which means you can't use jio sim with calling, stuck with data only.\n3) No screen protection and no back cover with it. You have to buy covers at very high price like 1000 1500 more.\n\nOverall this is a nice tablet in this price.\nHope this information is helpful to you.\nThanks.",
            "If your looking for a basic laptop for working ms office and stream some YouTube or netflix well you can switch your preference to this tablet as it can do all of it.\nespecially considering the price of 21,000\nyour getting a 10 inch full hd display.\n7000+ mah battery\nslim abd elegant\neasy to carry around plus it has a sim card and sd card slot\nit even has support for a stylus. but not included in the package.",
            "Pros : Screen, Battery, Processing, Build quality, pricing.\nCons : Design of tab is in landscape mode which makes it a bit unusual to use especially with a cover on. Cameras are average like any other tab. EMUI is good and well optimised but it's a personal choice if you like it.",
            "The only thing I will say is that it's best in this price range and perfect for students as it has free stylus pen and it's stylus support and free M Pen and big battery and 4 speakers makes it different from other tablet and much helpful for students.\nThe only thing that I don't liked is it's OS 8 and mainly it's made in China.So think before buying.I bought it before this India china conflictand can't return also, otherwise I may have returned it.\nHope you understand what I want to say.",
            "Pros:\n1) Great sound you can feel the pump as 4 speakers blast (in landscape mode) as well as while gaming you don't cover them so its a good experience\n2) 1080p display\n3) Stylus which works decent\n4) Upgrade storage by SD card (I got 128gb card and now its smooth)\n\nCons:\n1) 1080p is fine but software like VLC and MX Player run jaggy if x265 format is played as the processor is old as well\n2) Stylus lags and has no buttons on it like other Huawei Active Pens which is handy as a controller\n3) Android 8 has glitchy support with some apps like Spotify which was constantly sticking by switching from portrait to landscape mode on its own. Software updates are required to fix these issues.\n\nHave paired it with a logitech k480 keyboard and 128gb samsung evo class 3 sd card. If you are looking for lenovo d330 alternative, this feels premium but the lack of software update might be concerning if things start to break drastically after Android R becomes stable amd support for Oreo would be reduced.\n\nNo Desktop mode so that's a buzzkill.",
            "FIRST OF ALL THANS TO SUPER FAST DELIVERY .. I GOT IT IN 2 DAYS THAN MENTIONED DELIVERY DATE ( 6 DAYS ).\n\nTAB IS JUST AWESOME, I WAS REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE STYLUS BUT IT WAS PRESENT IN THE BOX.\nAND THE STYLUS IS ALSO AWESOME BATTERY TYPE.

            "Great product with excellent delivery!! In between lockdown I never expected before time delivery - it was delivered one day ahead!! Big thanks to Ekart for their continuous good service. The product is simply awesome - you will definitely like its features, display and smooth operation. Not used much yet but picture, sound and touchscreen quality all are just great!! Camera is weak but sufficiently good pictures in lighted areas. Look wise it is sleek and smart - overall loved the product!! Can go for it without any doubt if you are looking for something for office work, studies, teaching or, simply gaming!! Stylus yet to use - hope it will also perform good. Thank you Flipkart!",
            "I bought this for study purpose. Great purchase. Nice and super responsive stylus pen and the audio is awesome. No use of buying extra Bluetooth speaker. Now I can reduce my physical book storing space. I love this one. Don't go for expensive Apple product when you get everything thing here. Only one thing missing in this tablet from Apple product is just the expensive logo the rest all same, who cares about Apple iOS.",
            "camera is average. NOT for photography purpose. for video call also it's looks poor compare to phone camera clarity.\n\nstylus pen not supplied along with tab. disappointed. but we can purchase from flipkart separately.\n\nHUEWAI keyboard not available. hence we need to purchase from other third parties. if HUEWAI keyboard support provided it will worth for us.\n\nbattery capacity found excellent. for average use we can expect last long for a day in single charge\n\nprocessor found Ok for this budget compared to lenova and other tablet where still they are using SD450 EQUIVALENT PROCESSOR. in this tab, Kirin 659 found good but if they provided Kirin 710 or 960 it will be better.\n\nkids section found good",
            "I received the tablet without the stylus as well. The main reason for buying this tablet is the stylus support and the bundled package, or I could've gone for mediapad t5 or samsung tab a 10.1. Flipkart has assured a resolution by Saturday. So will give an update then. The tablet itself is great for the price. The screen is good, the sound with quad speakers is excellent. Build quality is good but the volume rockers and power button are a bit flimsy. The battery life is surprisingly good for a tablet. There are no decent cover cases either for this product. Would still recommend if it comes with a stylus as originally assured, otherwise there are much better and cheaper alternatives. Edit: Got a mail and SMS from Flipkart assuring the stylus and a gift card would be given by Oct 25. Have received the gift card, awaiting the link for stylus. Will update on receiving the same. EDIT: Received the stylus as assured . Works like a charm! Good work by Flipkart keepingup its word. But the entire scenario could've been avoided to begin with!",
            "Everything is top notch..\n- performance wise a decent one.\n- battery wise it's superb monster.\n- sound quality, oh my godamnn.. it's beyond words. U will feel like u are listening on a flagship level sound speaker. Heavenly beautiful.\n- Display is a good IPS one. Wil definately enjoy the multimedia experience.\n\nOne small thing I didn't like is that.. there is scarcity of good quality covers n tempered glass for this model. U will not find any accessories for this in the offline market..other than that..m highly satisfied with the purchase.",
            "Fantastic product. Value for money. Awesome specifications. Consistently out of stock. Flipkart should arrange more stocks. I bought it on the recommendation of a close friend and I have been recommending the same to my friends. But sadly the product is out of stock.",
            "It is a very nice product.\nBattery back up is nice 8 h and more\nDisplay is more comfort for children's\nCamera is also good\nHotspot easily joint , wifi , 4 g also\nVery slim ...\nValue is loudly..\nOver all good...\nValue for money....",
            "Very good tablet for media uses like watching movies, reading eBook, gaming, little bit drawing also, overall the best budget tablet I can say. You must be having trouble in choosing between iPad 2017 and this but if you are not professional and will not going to use this for note taking, save your money and go for huawei mediapad. Stylus is good but it can't be compared with apple pencil, considering the price.",
            "Such a valuable tablet with so good specifications at so reasonable price.\nHighly recommended to all",
            "The pen works really well. If you don't have budget for iPad or galaxy tab s6 lite then I would suggest you to go for Huawei mediapad m5 lite. This is the best budget tablet that offers a native pen which writes quite well. The palm rejection is quite well and doesn't have any issue till now. The only cons is the processor which is a bit slower than the other tablet at this price range like galaxy tab a7. If you are a student and willing to do online classes and take notes with this tab you can definitely go for it. But if you want gaming and video streaming then you might go for some other available in the market like galaxy tab a7. This is a review given by use of one day testing all its features. Hope it would help you \ud83d\udc4d",
            "This tablet is what you call value for money. The big advantage of this tablet is its multimedia experience (both display and sound) and huge battery. If you're looking for a tablet under 20k with sophisticated balance of performance, then it will be perfect choice for you. Kid's corner is also an interesting feature in it. This tablet is basically built for kids and students.",
            "Good price Good display Good Battery.... Some time lag... And hanging.... But this price range tab is very good....... Samsung A7 TFT display not IPS diplay compare to sam A7 and Huawei m5 lite this tab great... Diplay is awsome it playing 8k videos and 2k resolution diplay quality awsome....",
            "I am writing review after 15days of using. I can say that its good in this price range compare to samsung or apple. Camera is average. Battery backup is good. Stylus works smoothly and fast.\nYou can see the attachments. Huawei has to upgrade Android system from 8 to 9.",
            "One of the best tablets in market. I would say this is the best one. Go for it and you will see real value for money. The display and speakers are just fabulous",
            "Thanks Flipkart for 1 day prior delivery. Product is real value for money.\nSound quality is amazing. Calling works fine with Jio with location service ON. But I took little time to research it. Basic manual could have helped here.\nBattery life is awesome.",
            "Best android tablet in this price range, excellent battery backup, amazing display and sound, good performance except for a lag while playing heavy games. Suitable for studies and multimedia, the only issue is with the os, still operating on Android 8.",
            "Overall Perfect buy \u263a\ufe0f in this price.\nNice Display, speakers, battery, front camera...\nStylus works fine for normal use.\nPerformance is good for normal use(around 2 gb RAM free).",
            "Finally getting my hands on the tablet is really engrossing. Had to reorder it since the first time was cancelled by the seller for reasons unknown. Value for the price. Have to wait for the M pen which Flipkart had assured will be available at a later date to fully use the tablet's potential. So far so good. Received the re.1 coupon for the M pen and placed the order today i e 26th of October as promised by Flipkart.",
            "Compare this tab to iPad air with pen support, and the pen comes in the box..\nThough older android version, the usability is perfect.\nChoose 4G-64G model if budget allows, it functions real smooth for day to day use (docs/browsing/media)\nHas premium finish, unexpected high sound quality - this will surprise you for media consumption.\nThe landscape mode home button camera may seem un-natural in beginning, but are great for video calling as well as many other apps.\nAccessories for the pad are available on other online stores. The variety may be limited, but you can find well fitting once easily.\nBattery life is very good. Because of big screen, compare this to a 4000mah battery phone. Lasts thorough the day mostly with continuous use.\n\nIt's a great tablet for media consumption, video calling and occasional document work.",
            "This is really the Ipad killer. The performance is amazing The looks are u class apart. Huawei has put handwriting mode for every text box which enhances productivity to another level I use the stylus for taking notes and it does the job pretty well.\nIf you are looking for a really pafomant tab, and I dont believe in lugging my laptop everywhere, this is a very serious contender\nFew cons:\nLack of accessories\nThis pad should be the number 1 product of Huawei, but the reseller did a stupid job of.the delivery and so ratings went bad\n\nTHE TABLET IS GOOD PERIOD. The stylus is key to fully utilize it (and can be bought separately\nGood screen guards comes should be available\nPros\nSound is amazing\nHardly any lag\n\nAmazing screen quality\nHandwriting software by Huawei is game Changer(I wrote this entire review using the M pen(and my handwriting is not particularly good but everything went pretty smooth)\n\nUse. it for studying, notes, its a productivity enhancer. I will use for a few more days and give a long user review",
            "Missing AMOLED Display here.( lesser Brightness) colour are faint but video quality is good. Few lags. Stylus (slightly heavy) and finger print sensor- wonderful and very fast. Wrong place of power on and volume buttons. Poor camera quality. No face unlock. Kirin is good but pure android tab works better. Its older android version 8.0.\nBattery backup good but charging time 4 hr.\nSound quality is good not the best as described.\n\nBought in aug2020 @ 23k.",
            "Nice product.. Go for it... Average camera quality... Quad speakers enhances the audio quality..stylus works awesome.. But I would mention that it takes time to get fully charged but charging durability is good... As well as I will like to say that in opinion for accessories.. I don't think great bcoz when I searched for its flip cover I could not search the exact model number as well as size... So I will rate 4 out of 5..",
            "A very good product. It feels premium. I felt it bit heavy. Only one problem is no good flipcover available, though its trivial. M pen is absolutely beautiful to use. Performance is excellent as 4 gb is better.",
            "I brought it during sale for 16700/- including HDFC offer and brought Huawei pen separately.\n\nPros:\n1. Battery: The battery life is really good. Charging 7000mAh completely takes around 4-6hours based on the quick charger. Once it is charged, you can easily expect it for 1day for massive usage ( I repeat massive).\n\n2. Display: watching Netflix, prime, hotstar, youtube.... are really good. The display is good.\n\n3. Huawei Pen: That's a good add on. You can right notes easily or do basic surfing with the pen, when you're in a Starbucks. You get little attention from people around you for using it.\n\n4. 4G Connectivity: This is also a good feature, you can have dedicated sim and use data through it instead of using hotspot from your mobile.\n\n5. Design: initially it looks odd to have landscape orientation but believe me you will get habituated to it and the tab itself is so slim and light weight for its construction.\n\n6. Fingerprint Scanner: it's very fast and quick.\n\n7. Speakers: It has total four speakers and they are really loud and clear. Moreover the speakers are made by Harman Kardon, they are once of the leading companies in Automotive division. They sound similar to google home mini.\n\nCons:\n1. Cameras: both the cameras are good for Skype and video calls but don't expect any advance features you see in smartphones. It's an average camera.\n\n2. Charging Time: Though it supports 18w fast charging, it takes 4hours minimum to charge it's huge battery.",
            "It is excellent tab it supports all apps including google apps also. Camera also very Good.Sound also excellent. Great battery . Very slim tab. We can see in this tab Watts app,calling,zoom meeting, all futures are excellent.",
            "Here is my DETAILED and GENUINE REVIEW of Huwaei Mediapad M5 Lite after using it for nearly 10 days.\n*DISPLAY: Display is really awesome and too bright. Watching web series and any YouTube videos at 1080p is really enjoyable. The auto-brightness works well and also touch response is great. Under 20k price ,overall display is outstanding(Multimedia and entertainment king).\n*BUILD and DESIGN:Full metallic body and looks premium. But remember it's slippery, so better to use cover.\n*PERFORMANCE:Performance is Ok, no lag issue found till now. But remember Kirin 659 is not for heavy gaming. I am using this tab for my study purpose and I am fully satisfied . Split screen works fine and multi tasking is also great in 4GB RAM option. RAM management is descent.\n*SPEAKER :Wow, the speakers are powered by Harmon Kardon and these sounds really great. Music listening in this tablet is fun and enjoyable.\n*M-PEN: M-pen stylus works fine. Sometimes it lags but what Huwaei provides under this price no other tablet provides any stylus support. Note taking is OK.\n*CAMERA: Camera is average and also tablets are not for photography purpose. Online classes, video calling, documents scanning is overall great in this tablet.\n*BATTERY : Outstanding and nice battery backup . 7500mAh battery performs great.\n*SOFTWARE And ANDROID 8: This is the only downside of this tablet if you consider its old Android 8 version. But for me, there is no problem with Android 8 and google services works fine . But it will be better if Huwaei upgrade its Android version to Android 9 pie or Android 10 in future.\nNOTE: This tablet is highly recommended for students and note taking is overall great. This tablet is not for gaming purpose.\nSo, under the pricing of 20K , it is the best option available in market.",

This Tab checks all the boxes.\nAnd of course the Stylus which is cherry on top. \ud83d\udc4c\n\nThat\u2019s all in an affordable budget if you compare to other Tablets \u270c\ufe0f\u270c\ufe0f\n\nThe only negative point is Android update not being available (For its own reasons) due to which apps like YouTube at times couldn\u2019t display videos etc.\n\nBarring that, it\u2019s a good bargain at this price.",

The Harmon Kardon Quad Speakers setup is quite decent and Loud enough to fulfill the requirement of you and your room space.\n3. 4GB RAM and 64GB of ROM, enough to handle your daily tasks.\n4.

For storing videos and pics, you use a SD card.\n- Performance/Gaming - Not meant for gaming. PubG runs on low graphics mode.\n- Camera - is good for video calling but not for video recording.\n\nNote:\nFor customers who brought during big billion days but didn't received the stylus, they can buy the stylus from flipkart website (search huawei-m-pen-lite-stylus) at Rs 1",

            "Great",
            "Just awesome.\n\nI had an apple ipad 3 for quite some time. My biggest grouse with Apple was that they stop support for devices after some years for newer generation of iOS. Although it happens on android too, but, Android devices are not that expensive.\n\nComing from an apple ipad 3, this tablet seemed way faster.\n\nScreen: Screen is decent but not smooth. I use a OnePlus 7T (on 90Hz), and I feel the transitions leave a trail which irritates sometimes. Otherwise, the tab has a bright screen which is sufficient for most tasks on a daily basis. Glare is quite evident and some improvement could be done by Huawei in this department.\n\n\nActive Pen: Works beautifully. Blocks unwanted touches to a large degree and works with low latency. Feels quite premium.\n\nCamera: not very good but you won't buy a tablet for its camera. If a camera is your priority, look elsewhere.\n\nBattery: Superb. Lasts over a day of excessive usage.\n\nPerformance: Good for a tablet in this price range. Did not have trouble handling multitasking. Ram seems to be enough at 4GB. Processor could be better.\n\nStorage: came with 64 GB, and is expandable. Decent speeds.\n\nWifi/BT: good\n\nPricing: Got it for under 18k in BBD sale. Seems to be rightly priced with an active pen. Huawei could include a cover for protection.\n\nShould you buy it?\nBlame Steve jobs for making us want tablets. However, if your needs are to watch movies/series on a bigger screen vs mobile, do document editing, casual art etc, this is a good device for you. If you want a performance oriented tab, look at Samsung S6/S7.",

            "Overall good device\n1. Note-taking :- I am writing this review using M-pen(provided in package) and the text recognition is also fair enough. Use Inkredible app for note taking, which works flawlessly. It' s built in app, nebo, which is also good but has unnecessary restrictions while drawing something directly over page. Squid doesn't work well. Bamboo paper works average on it.\n2. Video playback and Sound :- Gorgeous display with good colours. Plays 1080P, 60 FPS like a Charm. supports max, upto 1440p . Lacks 4k playback. Audio quality is more than enough for you unless you are fond of music with various low and high beats. Low beats are mostly suppressed by speaker, so not so pleasing at that time.\n3. Smoothness of UI:- Smooth for medium usage. Lags for a second or two while switching between tabs in chrome. Other things work very well like navigating across various apps, multi-window feature.\n4. Gaming :- Stuck at Iow graphics in COD mobile. PUBG-minor frame drops at balanced graphics & medium frame rate. Asphault-8 > Stuck at High graphics and playable frame rates, graphics are excellent. Asphault 9 works a bit smoother on default visual settings and plays smoothly most of the time.\n5. Battery Life :- Good enough for long day use. Has 18W charging rate although bundled charger has a Maximum rating of 40W.\nI got it at rupees 17529 On big billion days using SBI credit card.\n\nOverall serves it's purpose well. 8/10 from my side because of its outdated processor, not so fluent gaming and a bit of lag under medium to heavy usage like playing FHD videos in any website and simultaneously doing some work in other window.\nIn built screen recorder, app locker, file vault, eye comfort display and fingerprint sensor are really useful.\nIt has Android 8 and no further updates for it, but Android 10 is also not any special. This tab gets August 2020 Security Patch which is very good.\n\nBut note that, no other tab available in this price range offer you a good gaming. Samsung Tab A7 is same for gaming, COD mobile works ultra smooth on high settings but all other games lag. Galaxy tab S6 lite is not so good for gaming but S-pen is better than M-Pen.\n\nWarning: - Never use any tempered glass if you want to enjoy the stylus sensitivity as intended.\n\nA good and a bad news for you :- After using tablet, your mobile may feel too small and not so pleasing to you, it happened for me, but what a mobile does no other device can.\n\nBuy it if you want a cost-effective, entry-level note-taking tablet as it's built for that.\nFor pure note-taking, drawing and graphic designing, nothing can substitute Ipad Air/Pro with Paper-like screen protector, even expensive android tablets like galaxy tab S7/S7+ comes with compromise in this particular aspect.\n\nSo, go for it...",

If u want this for study purpse.. doesn't matter what OS is..",
            "Very nice tablet.. Smooth performance",
            "I bought 3/32 version in 14,399/- after using SBI card discount. If you don't have use for too much space, 3/32 will work great as you get around 21GB free space and around 2.3GB free memory.\n\nOthers have already mentioned most of the features but a couple of them which went unnoticed are as follows:\n\n1. It has a WiFi bridge option. It means that you can connect to one wifi and share that same wifi as hotspot simultaneously. It's really handy feature to extend wifi range.\n\n2. It can also charge your phone as act as powerbank using appropriate cable (didn't try but there is one option when you connect the usb cable)\n\n3. Huawei HiSuite is the perfect software to manage tab - backup/restore and OS management; e.g. recovery. I had to use VPN to download it. Maybe the site is blocked. Benefits of HiSuite\na - It provides a feature to allow to connect HiSuite enabling USB debugging and this has vast impacts. It makes your tab ultra safe. Even if someone gets access to your tab, OS can't be flashed if USB debugging is enabled which will render it useless for thieves too!\nb - You can backup almost everything (yeah no need to backup to Google just keep it locally) - including system settings, apps WITH DATA. No need to root to make backups. Even if you have to root you can make backup and restore everything.\n\n4. The charger supports 10W, 18W and 40W fast charging! I don't know how much the tab supports but this charger can be used with perhaps the newest fast charging phones.\n\n5. Battery is super awesome and the OS is very much optimized. I got approx 20 hrs screen time with mostly PDF (Xodo software) and Onenote - stylus. I had used wifi for around 2-3 hrs in totality, SIM for around 10 minutes only (just to test) and was on power saving mode for the whole time. Xodo has this feature to keep screen on which I enabled.\n\nThis is the best OS I've come across. I rooted my old phone because it lacked some basic features but this tablet OS is bundled with all of them with some additional features as well - navigation gestures (fingerprint and on screen with that circle kind of icon), rotation to 90, 180, 270 degrees, Speed meter on status bar, Wifi bridge, Power On/Off schedule, Option to backup apps with data and the best which I didn't even think of - Using HiSuite without enabling USB debugging.\n\nThose who are not happy with Android 8, guys new android versions rarely have something for the end customers. Mostly those are for developers who get new API and developer tools. So, except a few features like Desktop mode, those are more or less useless.\n\nOnly con is that the MPen is not perfect. It sometimes misses taps which is acceptable. After 4-5 days, now MPen seems to write better. Maybe I took time to get used to it. The taps are still not flawless and small parts of the strokes are missed too (rare, though) but I watched on a video that even apple pencil tend to behave like that.\n\nFor those who need this to study, this is absolutely bliss in Android and in this price segment. Getting it for 14,400/- (on BBD) is in my opinion, a very good price considering 4/64 GB phones with around 6inch screen phones are available for around 9K. Still, this tab can very well be considered worth 18K. Can't say above that is just or not.",

The added advantage is stylus support. The functionality of style is a bit limited. You can use stylus for taking notes in limited app. Bus there is no skin support for stylus like samsung which lets you write any time on your screen whether you are on main window or browsing web or taking screen shot. The functionality of stylus is limited as UI is not as refined as samsung.",
