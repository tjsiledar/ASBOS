            "I cant call this a tab, its more like a phone similer to the previous lenovo phab 2 varients. Anyway I will start with the cons. 1. The camera is very average. Making a quality video is impossible. Frame rate is below average. 2. We can replace the bottom navigation bar with new gesture navigation, but it appears as an annoying little mark at the bottom. It does not have the option to hide it. Apart from these, the device is awesome. The first thing is its big display, which gives a premium experience in gaming and watching videos. Second best thing (and probably the best) is its battery. The gigantic 5100 mah battery makes my day. You wont believe that I didnt charge this device for 2 whole days of continuous usage of internet. The 4 gb ram and 64 gb internal memory makes multitasking super easy. The fingerprint scanning is super fast, better than my Samsung a20. In my opinion, if you are looking for a mid range utility phone, this is the one.",

But thanks to it, the battery consumption is very slow and the battery also charges very fast (90% in 2hrs) without QuickCharge feature.

It's actually a phablet, it's good for daily usage like online class, working in Microsoft android apps, playing mid range games, watching videos etc. For watching movies, this phablet is best with it's big screen & amazing sound quality.\nTherefore, I will definitely suggest this phablet.",
            "Get your work done with this fablet.\nVery neat UI and clutter free.\nEssential features and a great processor to bring out the best performance from those features .\nLenovo always works on introducing something which is uniquely priced and placed amongst other brand offerings in the same price bracket to give them a run for their money .\nThis is one of the top recommended product and one shouldn't give it a second thought when you are looking to consider this product .\n\nI would rate it 4.5/5 ....\nREAD MORE",
            "The only reason for buying this device is the 18:9 aspect ratio screen which is almost 7 inch in size much better than the narrow and taller aspect ratio devices flooding the market lately. There is absolutely no notch so a perfect rectangular screen. Screen brightness is a bit low, so does not look lively. Image quality from both the cameras is obviously disappointing. Battery life is good (not excellent) but the weight of this device is surprisingly light and very evenly balanced. I only wish that it came with a screen protector and a transparent silicon back cover, hope Lenovo is listening to this loud and clear. After market accessories for this device is non-existent. I like the type-C port but miss NFC and Bluetooth v5 (this one is Bluetooth v4.2). Processing speed is average, I see lags even while scrolling through SMSes and I only have saved a few hundreds The sotware is fantastic, no bloatware except apps like Skype and Netflix which I use. In fact, it feels bare-bones, I can't even find an option to swap the Menu and Back soft on-screen buttons \ud83e\udd14. Very sober looking, not like the gradient flashy back that you see on other recent launches. I wish there was an 6GB RAM / 128GB storage version priced under 16k to really make a good value. So I write this review with mixed emotions. Obviously this is the best specs device for such a large screen but somehow feels extremely underwhelming. Go for it only if you are absolutely absolutely sure what you are getting into. In terms of the unique form-factor, it stands 2nd to none.",
            "I finally got a huge phone of 4/64 gb variant. I like its amazing sound quality. Display is ok, neither good nor bad. Processor is ok though it is old. Now, it has android 9. I don't know when android 10 will receive!. Battery back up is very good. I found some cons in this phone which includes missing of auto call recording and dual apps. If Lenovo gives regular software updates in this phone, it will be very good. Inspite of huge battery, phone is very light when it holds in hand.",

The complaints were about its 'monstrous size of 6.9 inches', slow 1.8 GHz Snapdragon Processor and weak camera.\n\nBut i finally bought it because although those complaints were valid, they didn't matter in the least to me for my day to day usage requirements.\n\nHere are the positives :\n\n1. I love the monstrous size. It is huge but not unwieldy like a tablet. In fact, it will fit into any normal pant or coat pocket with ease.\n2. The resolution of the screen is very good and pixles are invisible until you strain your eyes really hard to see them.\n3. The UI is slick and smooth and even multitasking is fast. The snapdragon 450 doesn't feel strained by any measure.\n4. The build quality is excellent.\n5. The 4GB/64GB combo with 128GB SD Card added is more than enough for all my needs.\n6. The 5180 MAh Battery lasts for two days with normal use interpersed by video and gaming sessions.\n7. The rear Camera takes above average quality shots in light and dark conditions. It is definitely not pro oriented. The front camera is acceptable and the Bokeh effect is a plus.\n8. The fingerprint reader is very accurate.\n\nHere are the negatives :\n\n1. The Camera setup could have been better but lenovo had to think about the price of the product.\n2. The face recognition is a bit finicky.\n3. The battery needs a long time to charge completely.\n\nAll in all, it is an exceptional product at a bargain price.",

After juxtaposing Tabv7 vs Tab4 8 plus, decided to select v7 4GB/64GB as its 2 year recent release. Trade off is v7 having 450 chipset while 8 plus has 625; both snapdragon.\n\nThe prime purpose of the tablet is browsing and movies with no gaming. Out of the box the tablet has Android 9 that is followed by 2 updates that was a good impression. However, observing fractional lag initially while opening apps and that make my recommendation for 4GB RAM model over 3GB. Color production, battery backup, call quality, speaker volume, apps compatibility offers no issue but a quantitative update will be posted in a while.\n\nFlipkart paking was horrendous, the main box was damaged from one side, fortunately with no visible harm to inside tablet box. The manufacturing date shows July-2019. Checking warranty status on Lenovo website shows product was already activated with warranty 8 months before my purchase. Not good. Advice to all buyers to check manufacturing date of any product that is purchased to avoid unpleasant surprises.",

            "At first, I was a little apprehensive about purchasing this as I hadn't owned such a big mobile before, but this monster came as a pleasant surprise!\n\nThough it's a big mobile, once you get used to it, you will feel that it's very practical and user friendly.\n\nHere is my review -\n\nPros -\n\n1. The build is really great. Looks good. Good grip from the back and it feels more premium than many mid-range phones with glossy finish.\n\n2. Big screen is awesome. No notch to ruin your experience. It plays beautiful 1080p videos. Text is big and clear. Great experience while reading mails, pdfs and browsing\n\n3. Touch sensitivity is really nice. I have used sAMOLED screens in the past and it's a similar experience\n\n4. Battery life is great. After a day of heavy usage, there is still some juice left\n\n5. Notification LED\n\n6. Fingerprint reader is really fast. Face recognition is not best but not bad either\n\n7. Sound quality is excellent! Surround sound with some base. You can feel different sounds very clearly and great experience while playing pubg and video watching\n\n8. 4g call quality and clarity is excellent. This is one of the best clarity I heard in a phone. plus speaker output is awesome.\n\n9. Stock android is another best selling point of this phone. Though it has not so powerful processor but my experience has been mostly fluid and without lags\n\nCons -\n\n1. As someone pointed out, certain software features are missing on the like display remains on while you are reading\n\n2. You can play games but at medium to low graphic settings for smooth experience\n\n3. YouTube app has a minor issue where the navigation buttons appear while watching video even without touching (but if you open YouTube via chrome this problem goes away. Netflix and prime experience really good with such a good quality screen)\n\n4. Camera setup could have been better but still rear camera does a good job\n\n5. Charging takes long time\n\noverall it is a quality product and if you are looking for something new and interesting, go for it",
