Gets slow when many apps are installed..\nNo option to mute screenshot shutter sound so screenshot can't be taken in silent places.\nOverall price point of view it is value for money budget tab with good display, speakers, battery life.",

The one thing which I didn't like is it took too much time to charge around 3:30 hours.. but infront of its qualities you can neglect this problem.. I recommend you to buy this this is worth your money seriously",

No updates will be given by Realme\n2. Camera could've been improved\n3. Face I'd sometimes don't work properly(8 out of 10 times works well)... It can be fixed with an update\n4. Realme UI does not offer any great features. Though it's free from bloatware, it's very clean and simple\n\nOverall, its best value for money if the cons doesn't matter you\nEven if it's matters it's still a good choice(no better competitors under this segment)",

            "There is no doubt that this realme tab is the best budget tab under 16-18 thousands.. available till date. For the purpose of online classes, studies, making notes and for doing mild office work for 2 to 3 hours, it is a perfect choice. Touch response is awesome. With OTG support you can attach pendrive and bluetooth mouse and keypad as well. Calling support provides you flexibility of using 4G SIM in it. Screen size, brightness, eye comfort feature, reading mode, working in split screen increases productivity. I am writing this review after the rigorous use of three months....... the only con is that realme must provide a screen guard with it....anyways I have bought a leather cover and a screen guard from Flipkart itself.",
            "Genuine Review.\nIf buying for notemaking and study purpose go for it if the budget is below 20k. Best in range from looks to working. Speaker are top notch\n\nPerformance won't look great if you are using phone worth 20k but for being a big screen and nice price range it is the best.\n\nGot it for online notemaking and video classess works superbly fine.",

            "For the price it has got very decent specs. Screen and speakers are definitely its strong zone. Performance is ok. G80 is powerful enough to do all basic tasks.\n\nHowever the only downside of the product is its software. Os needs some major updates, because its just as important as hardware. Hopefully realme will provide them soon.",

            "Great tablet at this price range. Especially when I consider that the entire tablet segment in India is quite pathetic right now. So Realme has made a strong offering. But I do hope that multitasking capabilities will improve in the future with Android 12 and new software updates - right now it's still a little unintuitive.\n\nBut performance of the tablet is remarkable for a mediatek processor. Very light lag.",
            "Only thing left behind is amoled display.my phone is oppo Reno 10x zoom which says it has Dolby Atmos but it doesn't.This tab has it.while playing games amazing experience experience with Dolby atmos.we can clearly hear the steps of other players.\n*Quad speakers are awesome.sound is really superb.no need of external speakers.\n*Gaming (free fire) experience is also good.\n*Calls clarity also good.no problem so far\n*Display is little bit back step because it is not amoled that the reason I have given 4 stars.\n*Build quality is awesome.feels very premium.very slim and the metallic finish at the back is awesome.\nExcept display I didn't find any cons so far.\nTrust me friends you can go for it blindly.from price point of view if it is a little less like 16k it's a great deal but now also okay",
            "Very Nice Tab . Bang For your bucks. Processor is ok for day to day tasks. No Lags while streaming from Netflix and Prime video at full HD resolution. Sound is also loud and clear. Cameras both front and back are not good but at this price point its ok. No pre- applied screen protector. 18 W charger included at this price point is very good. Double tap to wake up screen would be very useful as you have to reach to the power button every time to unlock the tab. Its a very good buy . Happy with the purchase.\nAlso i don't know why flipkart always misses the promised delivery date.",

Decent performances with super \ud83d\udd0b backup tht runs and runs very fine . \ud83d\udcf8 cud have been a bit better when it comes with its prices but overall th tabs aren't meant for foto clicks .\nRAM \u2648 management is just too good and no heatings reported so far.

The display is good but not as bright and clear as Samsung. Basically it is because of the contrast ratio which is poor in comparison. The user interface is bad with No frills. You can't even change the theme of the desktop. You can only change wallpapers and that too which are preloaded. There are many small thing which makes the interface poor and makes you feel should I pay another 2k more go for Samsung.

So some times you can feel that so much loudness is kinda unnecessary.\n\nNegative : well lots of.. 1.Display .. it is dull and has very low brightness. No problem indoor at evening or morning if you shut your windows and pull down all cover... But even if you watch it indoor beside an open window, it will be problematic. And out door ?? Just forget it.\n2.Ui limitation.. even you cant use a custom launcher. No special feature at all.. tap to wake is there but no tap to sleep. No fp sensor and having power button on top ,it is very difficult sometime. 3.camera.. is very avarage. 4.Battery. Too early to say.. but it seems just bad as battery life.. only 16 hrs with 4.5hrs sot if you watch movies for 3 to 4 hrs. charging time is really high. It takes 3hrs 40 mins to 20 to 100%. 5. It has a tendency to get warm very quick.\nVerdict :within 10 to 12k it is ok.",

If you don't mind spending extra money and if you want the perfect product, iPad 8th or 9th gen should be the choice. This is half the performance of iPad. This is half of everything in ipad. And iOS will provide voice isolation for better call quality. After using an ipad, you will never like this pad. And you don't have the data privacy with Chinese products as per the latest news. I dint check the dimensions properly and ordered this. Otherwise I would have ordered A7 itself. A7 and realme are just the same. No difference. In A7, you get a promise that it's more secured by Knox. This order was a mistake and I dint want to go thru refund process. So I am keeping this. I would suggest others to buy A7 if they are on a budget or buy ipad for a perfect product. And no need to choose this at all. I thought it will have a better dimension lik ipad and was disappointed. I gave 4stars because it still serves most of my daily needs and 4g option. With 4g, I can take it anywhere.",

Just some Google apps are pre-installed.\nDisplay is very good. It's slightly better than FHD. Brightness is good for indoor work but for outdoors it's not sufficient.\nSpeakers are the best part of this tablet. It has Dolby Atmos support and has quad speakers which easily fill up the room. You will surely love it!\nPerformace is surprisingly better than expected. It comes packed with Helio G80 chipset which you find in 10k range phones. I played Pubg (low ultra settings) and Asphalt. Didn't get any lag as such.\nComing to UI. It's realme UI optimised for pad. It good but still need some work. Also, gestures can be improved.\n\nSummary:\nBest tab under 20k as of now. Go for it blindly for entertainment and education purposes. Wouldn't recommend it for heavy gaming.\nDo like this post if you find it helpful. Cheers and Thanks!",

            "This is a value for money tablet. Ideal or Kids' Online classes\nTouch is responsive unlike many other cheaper tablets.\nSound is good from Quad speakers. Kids can listen to their teachers very well and good for watching movies too.\nSince it is coming with near stock Android 11, it has an inbuilt video recorder in case you would like to record kids classes. I found the recording to stop automatically after running for quite some time though. Also, sometimes I noticed that you have to restart tablet to start rcording again. May be a future software update wil patch it.\nIt supports Multiple users. So you can have an separate users created for adultsand kids and the appliocation settings wont be shared. You can also keep a track of the kids account using Goglr Family link by controlling the screen time and allow only kids safe applications. Family link Admin has to approve the playstore App installs not hitelisted for kids while using the kids user account.\nAlso supports google kids space for the kids accounts for better suggestion of Apps for kids. I was not comfortable with the user interface of kids space . So disabled it after installing necessary apps. Installed apps can stay.",

Realme just slammed them with this budget range tablet and with quality. I have used other budget tablet but this one feels Premium in this price range. A must buy product for those who are u looking for quality tablet under budget.\nPros :-\n1. Display is beautiful with great color production\n2. Gread design and slim, easy to carry.\n3. Sound? It's awesome, 4 speakers gives a movie experience with dolby. Best!!\n4. Battery backup is amazing.. Running 1.5 days easily with normal usage.\n5. UI is minimalistic and quite good.\n6. Comes with 18w charger and cable. What else you want? \ud83d\ude02\n\nCons :-\n1. Can't be use for high end graphic games as it is a budget tablet.\n2. I tried Genshin Impact. Its playable at low graphics.\n3. Front camera could have been better coz this tab main use is for meetings and video call.\n4. Not good in sunlight as brightness is very less for outdoor use but good enough for indoor use.. Best for indoor use. As no one's gonna use it outside on street \ud83d\ude02\n\nOverall must buy product. Thanks to Realme \u2764\ufe0f.",
