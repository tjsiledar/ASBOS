            "Its a decent tab at a big billion day price of 11700/-. After all my research, I could see this tab only which was latest (apart from Apple product)\n\nOnly thing the company can improve is internal memory! However this do support external memory.\n\nNothing new but a budget tab to read , play and watch movies! The sound quality is good.",
            "A decent budget tablet. Neat HD display. No lag. Did not use the SD card yet, so need to see the performance after inserting the SD card. I recommend using class 10 card. Brilliant sound from the inbuilt speakers. Haven't tried games with high graphics but it was able to handle other games flawlessly. Wifi reception is very decent. Comes with pre installed MS office. Very less to no bloatware. Please do not compare this with other tablets at the range of Rs 25000. If you are looking for a great camera, this is not the one for you.",
