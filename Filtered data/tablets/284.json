            "With the A8X chip iPad Air 2 is the fastest of all IOS devices . And thinner than a pencil.... its INCREDIBLE ..! Don't think twice ..just go for it.......but make sure that in 16gb you'll only get 11gb of free space and the rest goes with ICLOUD ?",
            "This is a brief review assuming you're already familiar with ipads. I've owned a first gen mini, second gen mini, and IPad air 1 but this is definitely the best yet. Its really thin and apps load fast. We also have 2gb of ram, so apps like safari don't have to reload tabs. You can actually switch between apps without having to Wait for them to reload. The 1gb in other Apple products may be enough, but they won't be for future iOS updates whereas this iPad will handle the updates better making this kind of future proof.\n\nThe Touch ID is another stand out addition. It's great and also makes using passwords so much quicker. It's actually quicker to use Touch ID to unlock your iPad than to not have a password and swipe to unlock. The cameras are \"better\" but I personally don't care for such things. The battery life is on par with other iPads. Expect 10 hours.\n\nOne annoying thing is that the speakers vibrate (Especially when it comes to bass) the whole iPad because it's so thin. If you use headphones, nevermind but otherwise be aware of that. Lastly, the anti-reflective screen doesn't help reflections as well as I thought it would. It also seems harder to clean. Overall a wonderful and actually \"future proof\" iPad.\n\nPros: lighter, faster, more ram, better cameras\nCons: the speakers are \"all about that bass\", antiglare screen is a smudge magnet",
            "Shipment : Nice packing, flawless. Delivery was well ahead of time.\n\nProduct: undoubtedly, the best tablet in the market. Robust operating system, Robust set of applications, a lot of scope for creativity. I know apple products are expensive, but i would rather invest on a ipad than a iphone for a reason that it easily replaces your home computer and you can pretty much do all of your day to day tasks on your tablet without going to your laptop or desktop. I know one can achieve it on an iphone as well but you'll lose out on the screensize.",
            "A not so useful product if you're used to the accomplished androids. Bought it with high expectations, however came to realize that with iOS you can't do much. Now doing duty as an alarm and youtube player. Hardware is excellent though be it screen or sound or overall build.\n\nIn a nutshell, a great piece of hardware let down by a useless OS.",
            "Excellent product. My first apple gadget. Great for document viewing, movies, and everything. Battery life is good too. Charge once in two days with moderate use. Only issue is I find Android more user friendly coz I'm used to it. Rest everything, kudos.!",

Is a good product...all tabs put together and the iPad on the other side still does not match up...Apple is way ahead in technology..love the Touch ID, screen resolution, clarity, ..only one complaint...the CAMERA - the pictures are grainy, and bad quality..thats sad considering its an Apple product. The 3 star is for iPad minus the camera..",

Now doing duty as an alarm and youtube player. Hardware is excellent though be it screen or sound or overall build.\n\nIn a nutshell, a great piece of hardware let down by a useless OS.",
            "Excellent product. My first apple gadget. Great for document viewing, movies, and everything. Battery life is good too. Charge once in two days with moderate use. Only issue is I find Android more user friendly coz I'm used to it. Rest everything, kudos.!",
            "This is an good tablet..Flipkart....specifically WS retail...are reliable and bang for the buck...I have always got a great experience whenever I have ordered from WS retail...iPad air 2.... Is a good product...all tabs put together and the iPad on the other side still does not match up...Apple is way ahead in technology..love the Touch ID, screen resolution, clarity, ..only one complaint...the CAMERA - the pictures are grainy, and bad quality..thats sad considering its an Apple product. The 3 star is for iPad minus the camera..",

            "Apple with it's close but tablet optmised OS and applications stands much much in front than the android tablets .\nThe Android Tablets like Samsung Tab S and Nexus 9 , Sony Z2 Tab , Z3 Compact are good tabs , their screens and flexibility of Android is by par . but the applications doesn't look on them , the thing is the android developers don't create tablet optimised apps and there's where Apple tops the chart\nthe Ipad Air 2 tablet have almost 2 days battery , one of the best screen and it's so thin and light and there are many ipad optimised and productivity and business oriented applications for ipad .\nIt's the best if money isn't the factor\nyou may consider the Ipad air 1 , which is still the best tablet",
            "I pad air 2 was a good purchase for me... I will enumerate what I found very useful..\n1. I use ipad mostly for reading books and is night mode comes in very handy as it reduces the stress on your eyes.\n2.ios is the best operating System in tablets as is user-friendly with 5-6hrs of screen in time.\n3.the screen is bright with vivid color reproduction.\nI will recommend an antiglare screen protector for the comfort of your eyes.",

Fast performance even on ios 12.Front camera is awesome and back camera is not as good as iphone 5s. Battery idle drop rate is very low.\noverall so far so good..\n\ngeneral issues are-\nAuto rotate screen sometimes not work properly it may be a software or hardware issue and i have seen this issue in previous models of ipad also.\n\nmy opinion-\nDon't buy 16 GB variant of this ipad model. Go for Pro models...",

            "Well,\nTo start with I had no intentions of purchasing this product now but was on my bucket list for this year.\nAn amazing deal cashback deal on the iPad on App Sale days lured me to purchase it right away\nPrompt next delivery by Flipkart.\nThe product is awesome with a cool design & lots to offer on the OS front making its cheap android competitors look avoidable.\n\nMUST BUY!!!",
            "I have to say, this is one of the best gadgets I have ever used, across all platforms and hardware plethora in the market. Such amazing power under such a sleek and premium exterior. This is my first Apple experience, and boy, makes me wanna switch all my devices to Apple products (although I still love my Nexus 5). Of course, FlipKart delivery at its best, received within 2 days of placing the order.\n\nDown to the real stuff. I find it difficult to present any Cons for this product. It is truly a masterpiece. Storage (16, 64 or 128GB) depends on how deep your pocket is, and I would suggest that a pure WiFi device would be more than adequate in these times of smartphones advances.\n\nThe only drawback or negative I could find is that while any audio plays, the device vibrates with. This is expected, with metal exteriors, not to mention how thin the device is, but well, once you snap a case on it, you will hardly notice a difference. And besides, audio/video is so much better on ear/headphones with the iPad Air 2.\n\nAll in all, I would suggest that this is a no-brainer. Buy it!!! Storage depends on your pocket, and the finger ID is quite a handy and pleasant addition to the iPad Air 2.",
            "i have written this review after 10 days of use ....\n\ni must say it's a very nice product , very light in weight , so handy to use ..\n\ni got it from flipkart app sale ...in which i got 2000 Rs. off on it using axis bank cards\n\n\npros\n\nvery light in weight .\nlatest operating system\ngood camera quality\ntouch id sensor\nvery elegant look\n\nCons\nNONE !!!\n\nOverall a\n\n\nAMAZING EXPERIENCE buying it\n\nJust go for it ..",

I also asked him flipkart is authorised to sell iPad, he told me yes flipkart is a authorised reseller of iPad.\nI was very happy to hear this and then i open the product.\niPad air 2 need no review for it's software and hardware so i have given some basic review.\n\nIPAD air 2 is very beautiful, thin, light weight it's simply gorgeous.\nBattery life; it takes almost 4 hours to completely charge from 0 to 100%.\nI get 3-4 days battery backup as i use it for 5-7 hours daily which include net surfing playing normal game and listening songs.\n\nProduct need no review simply it's apple awesome tablet with very beautiful body.\nIf you want to buy then buy with flipkart & WS RETAIL without any second thought.\n\nIf you have budget then get this beauty you never regret.",

            "bought this device and later replaced also.\nPros: very light weight and amazing touch response.\nCons:\n1. Unfortunately the 16GB one has only 10.5 available free\n2. icloud was not working and even apple care executives were not able to resolve. I was able to sync in a 64 gb device, but couldn't in 16 GB ones.\n3. The worst thing is from iOS 7 onwards, apple has withdrawn showing the filenames in photos and videos. Consequently, after transferring files to my ipad (via itunes), all the files were displayed as icons(all same icons) and no files names. Its a known issue. There is a tweak, but if you do it all the time you will loose substantial amount of time in that.\n4. While playing the video files, the rear cover feels shaky.\n5. Apple has withdrawn vlc player from its India app store, hence vlc player can no more be installed also.\nI own few apple devices, but this time apple disappointed. This is an absurd logic to withdraw displaying the names of the files and no mechanism to show it. It seems like they assumed there customers can't read and should be shown icons to identify. Thinnest but a crap from Apple this time.",

It fully met my requirements and then some.\n\nAcrobat Reader iOS app has lot of functionality for taking notes and annotate PDFs. Apple Pencil with pro would have been more precise but our human fingers are more than enough for taking free-hand notes with iPad Air 2.",
