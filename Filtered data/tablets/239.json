The screen is not glass, its plastic /fibre hence please use the scratch guard immediately after taking off the protective sticker and before you start using the tab. Glass screen would have been heavier but better. Apart from this the tab is light weight, which is cool. 1gb ram does the job. Its smooth and steady in processing so far. Happy...",

Obviously the camera is hopeless but I suggest this one is a great pick if you just need it for browsing etc, I dont think it will support games. I must also point out that the battery life is great! And charges also pretty efficiently. Not good if you want to download many apps. Hope this helps :)",

            "Very good Tablet at 3000/- price.\nIt gives perfect value for mobey.\nDon't Expect much from it as it is giving more than its price.\nGood for kids appps & watching videos.\nSound is good. Camera is average. Battery is good and lasts for 2 hrs with browsing or watching videos.\nThose who complaint about display quality, please note that this is 7inch screen with average display so don't expect to get quality like your 15k mobile screen. If you keep screen very close to your eyes, you may feel that the display is bad but keep at some distance and you will enjoy. You will enjoy watching HD quality movies.\nOverall I am happy with this tab. Value for money.\nIt comes with a Flexible Screen Protector. Applying that on screen is very difficult. It will be good if that comes applied from company itself. screen surface is uneven at edges which makes applying tempered glass screen protector difficult as it will not stick at all places and applying pressure may damage it.",

            "Display quality very bad, battery too small for a tablet. Now a days mobiles comes with 4000-5000mah battery and this tab comes with just 2500mah battery.\n\nAndroid oreo lite version is good for weak hardware but no updates, not even security patch update.\n\nCamera quality poor no big deal for this price.\nSoc very weak, you do anything in tab and it gets heated.\nSpeaker almost no exist, yes believe me when you will hear the sound of this tablet you will feel the same, like alcatel forget to put the speaker in this tablet and only ear piece volume increased. Very very tiny sound.\n\nOver all will not recommend this tablet to anyone not even kids.\nThis table is not usable due to very weak hardware, very poor dispaly, no speaker.\n\nPrice is low compare to other tablets but you cant use this tablet so no logic of making and buying such products.\nI also want to mention this tablet's build quality is so low even earphone output is too bad, my 'house of Marley' earphones worth Rs.2000 sounds like earphone worth Rs.20 when i pair them with this tablet.",
            "Just wow, Oh My God what a tab in such a low price, prosessor is so smooth, light weight, great for reading and kids use, I purchased it for my kids online classes and it's more than my expectations, and Flipkart is the best in delivery and providing the best quality. Thank You so much.",
            "Easy to carry n use. Does its job. Video latency a bit slow, but we are too used to our phones performing at incredible speeds. So it cannot be compared. Overall good value for money. Recommended for reading books and other utilities.",
            "Good product l like big screen for PDF reading camera quality is not better but good screen not full HD performance is good and battery life also very good.",
            "Good for ebook reading and web browsing.\nThe screen quality is worst. Performance is satisfactory even it can run Free Fire. Camera is below average. Battery life is better than I expected. It almost give 5-6 hours of screen on time and 2-3 hours of internet browsing time.\nFor a budget device it's bulid quality is good (I dropped it one day from 4 ft hight but still working without any visual damage) . It's pretty light weight.\nFor a 3k device it's value for money",
            "Good tablet at reasonable price.. I purchased it for my son.. Could have been much better if tempered glass screen protector was provide along with it",
            "I was expecting a little more from this tablet. It doesn't have IPS screen and therefore you cannot view the screen from angles. Slight change in viewing angle spoils the quality of picture. It takes plenty of time to charge the battery that is only 2500Mah.\nThe good thing is that it has plenty of free RAM even though it has only 1GB RAM. Light version of OS and APPS did the trick. The tablet is very light weight and you can easily handle it. Good product for 3k. Suitable only for people who just needs a tablet and doesn't care about display quality.",
