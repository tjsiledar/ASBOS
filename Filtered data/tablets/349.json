            "Only tab that offers latest Android version. Having reviewed several tabs, I can confidently say, this is the only large sized tab with close to 95% screen brightness uniformity . But I have to agree that despite non uniform screen brightness, Ipads have a crisp display due to high ppi. The Dolby atmos with quad speakers is certainly a best feature offered by Samsung and one will really appreciate it.iPads miserably fail on audio front. Major pro is good network connectivity, battery life, sound, touch responsiveness and guaranteed pie update. Major cons are slow multitasking capability, with only ~200 ppi, texts on pdfs are little blurred, pathetic auto brightness and quite heavy. Overall recommendation is to buy whenever the price drops like during big billion day or other festive offer days.",

            "It's a good product and since it bought in sale time the price was also good",
            "See basically it depends on your requirement. If u want a large screen experience, this one is for u. If its painful for u to live with small font size of your phone, this one is for u. But if u want a tablet for gaming then its performance will disappoint u. It also hangs when we rotate the screen from porttrait to landscape mode. Its internal memory is just 32 gb. But it can be compensated with 400 mb memory card. So its a mixture of pros and cons. Usb type c port can be found anywhere and pen drive/usb/data cable can be attached easily. Jio sim 4g compatible. Thanks",
