            "The product is excellent and very good design and good display. Effective for online classes.\n\nCamera is good both the front and rear",
            "This is the best 10 inch tab you will get for this price. If you have a limited budget of under 15k then look no further, this is the tab to get. I felt the screen quality is really great, the best you can get for an IPS display. It's got 3 GB of RAM and Snapdragon 450 so performance is quite okay. Build quality is great. You can truly enjoy videos on this tab.",
            "I am writing this review after using this tab for 10 days and my opinion is that it is excellent for basic use like for browsing, reading, mails, watching movies, entertainment, music, kids games, video conferencing etc..Battery back up and display are also good. Camera is not upto the mark. Sound quality is average but you can get good sound using bluetooth speakers. Stylus can be bought seperately.\n\nOverall with this price range, I will give it 4 stars out of 5.",
            "I bought this tablet mostly for watching videos.\nScreen is good (10inch and Full-HD) and battery backup is awesome(7000mAH). Its perfect for watching videos or surfing internet. Touch screen is good.\n\nThis tablet comes with Android 9 which is very clean and fast. It has no unnecessary Apps or bloatware.\n\nI do not play games so games performance is not tested. Please note, this is a Wifi only model, means you can not add sim-card in this.\n\nOverall a good tablet for this price range.",
            "I love the screen full HD ,\nI like size 19.4\nI like beterry 7000 MAH\nin budget like this , plz buy this\nBecause budget is matter for everyone,\nSo enjy movies, videos .. etc",
            "My experience with Lenovo M10 FHD REL\n\nPros:\n1. Decent config\n2. Good display , though pixel density could have been better for this price\n3. Slim design hence light weight\n4. SD card slot to expand the memory\n\nCons:\n1. Volume is quite low given two speaker points, even basic handsets have better volume range\n2. No type C charging port\nTouch could have been better",
            "Lenovo m10 Fhd, it's a very good tablet\nCamera quality is really good cause I'm using it for online classes the problem i faced with cam is that the face lock feature is not working properly and its a demerit\nA really good screen with 10.1inch display, fhd and its ips lcd display\nAlthough it has a 3gb ram its awesome to play games ive playe pubg mobile lite in medium graphics and its really smooth\nAnd alphat no problem no hang no heating\nThe battery performance is outstanding and unbelievable it last for a long time but they should've added fast charge with this tablet\nOn the day of purchase i got android 10 update i wish it would be 64gb bcause 32 gb is very low when we update it to android 10\nDolby atmos gives good sound experience\nIbought it for 13k so for me this tab is just marvellous",
            "Excellent design, brilliant display, good performance, and good battery backup. worth buying.",
            "My experience with the seller - I ordered the tab on 21st March, and received it on 23rd, but the screen was broken (probably due to mishandling during shipment). Under flipkart's and the seller's replacement policy, I got a new tab on 26th March. It's okay, mistakes do happen, but I'll advise everyone to record a video as an evidence while unboxing any expensive item bought from an online portal. I am happy that flipkart and the seller paid attention to my complain and rectified the mistake.\n\nMy experience with the tab - I bought it solely for online studies. You can guess looking at the tab's specs that it is not meant for heavy apps or gaming. I chose this one (the older version of M10 tab - M10 FHD REL) instead of the newer version (M10 FHD Plus) because while the newer one has 4GB RAM, its battery is only about 5000mAh. This one has a longer battery life, with a battery of about 7000mAh. For studies- my primary requirements were- okay-ish camera and performance, but good display and battery life.\n\nThe battery backup is good, and the tab runs for 1-1.5 days after a full charge. Screen and display resolution is very crisp (it is full HD), and the sound output is also good (has Dolby Atmos output).\n\nPerformance is okay-ish. It will lag if you run heavy apps/games, but will otherwise run smoothly if you are watching videos or studying, etc. Camera is also okay-ish. Even though the rear camera is 8MP, it is not as good as Samsung tab A7's 8MP camera. You can't use it for photography, however it is enough for casual photos or for important documents.\n\nAll in all, it is a perfect tab for studying. But if you want performance - then go for a tab with atleast 4GB RAM.",
            "Very nice product after using 15 days . The best tab under 15k. I love this product the lastest android version.",
            "Good product in this price range. Good for study purposes, not for gaming. Battery backup is good, lasts for 3 days with moderate use. Camera is not so good, unable to perform face unlock very often. Sound is good with dolby Atmos. If you have a budget of below 15k, then go for it.",
            "Lenovo M10 is a full HD tab with an elegant surface feel. The response time is quick making it a smooth experience waddling through different applications. 3 Gb ram makes it possible for many apps to work simultaneously.\n\nFor the best typing writing and doodling experience, use a stylus. It is available on flipkart.",
            "After using more than one month i am writing this review.\nIt is good for reading watching movies and light game like gunship battle. Battery is excellent. I used it 10 hours in a day and battery was more than 50% but it\u2019s depend how are you using. I have not used it for heavy game like pubg.\nOverall good performance. It is good product for a normal use.",
            "Looks and design - very sleek and premium.\nBattery - for a 7000 mah, the battery is not at par. The charging time is 3-4 hrs ( depending on the voltage at your place).\nFace recognition - works cool 3/5 times at one go.\nSound - quite good\nVideo and pictures - awesome.\nGaming - haven't tested yet\nCamera - front cam not good. Rear cam is okay. But generally we dont use a tab for cam or high end gaming.\nSmoothness - so far pretty good.\n\nOverall my rating would be 3.5 but giving 4 star for a good tab at this price range.",
            "I brought this product for my child online schooling n education.\nScreen is good full hd n 10.1 inch. Battery backup is very good par expectations. Perfect for watching videos as the sound quality is Dolby digital.\nTouch is v smooth & gives quick response.\nCamera quality can be better but it's manageable. I feel front camera is better than the back..\nGood budget phone my kido love's it...",
            "Awesome Tab in Such A great price range....\nI brought this in a price of Rs. 11700 which is best in this segment.\nOS are truly android\nEasily upgradable to Android 10\nPerformance was also very good after new update.\nBattery life is just awesome of 7000 mah was easily long lasting to 7-8 -hours on wifi or Youtube and 10-12 hour offline media streaming.\nCamera quality is also good to average just for video calling and other normal clicks..\nOverall Good performing Tab,\nI will rate this 4/5\n1 star deducting for Calling and LTE Support and low trafic performance. You can't play heavy games Smoothly like PUBG , COD or Asphalt 9 etc.",
            "Bought it for content watching and light reading. Serves the purpose.\n\nPros:-\n\nDisplay: Very good display .Colors are punchy and huge screen size. Video watching in this tablet is a joyful experience.\nProcessor: SDM 450 is a good choice in this price range, considering what are you getting in some other brands. More than enough for regular usage. However it is NOT FOR HEAVY GAMING.\nSpeaker: Dolby stereo speakers are very good with enough clarity and loudness.\nSoftware: Came with Android 9 out of the box but got Android 10 update after the first boot :)\n\nCons:-\n\nIt's a smudge magnet. Processor could have been better. However can't really complain considering the price of 13k (Flipkart Big Billion Day Sale).\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED",
            "I purchased this for my daughters online classes. It has both the qualities which are most important for that purpose: screen quality and battery\n\nScreen looks great and produces naturally rich colors.\n\nBattery easily lasts for a day with heavier usage.\n\nWorth buying if you are looking for a budget tablet.",
            "Its better tablet for its price. Everything is good. Camera and speakers sound could be better but its okay for this price range. Dolby Sound is nice addition with Bluetooth headset. Good for reading books. Coloring and learning activities for kids. Best part is its OS doesn't have any pre-installed rubbish apps. Android 10 upgrade is available. Its really fast. Display is also Good. Battery back up is reliable. Two days battery life for single charge on full usage. Its paisa vasool tablet. Great tool if used wisely. Don't forget to buy back cover and screen guard glass its essential.",
            "This is an awesome tablet.\n1) Camera: The camera is not bad for tablet. It however could have been better.\n\n2) Battery: There is no compromise on battery. It\u2019s great and lasting. For normal purposes this is a big plus.\n\n3) Performance: Performance is so so. A very few times I found the tab freezing for two seconds but overall the performance is great for doing office works and entertainment. Now this isn\u2019t an iPad don\u2019t expect flawless handling but it\u2019s quite great.\n\n4) Sound: Sound definitely could have improved so I use headphones.\n\n5) Face Detection: I don\u2019t know why many have said face detection isn\u2019t working. For me it works most of the times. I have a iPhone. Now for obvious reasons we can\u2019t expect the face recognisation to be like iPhone but it\u2019s pretty good.\n\nTHIS IS A MUST FOR ALL WHO WANTS TO DO ONLINE CLASSES,TEACH DO OFFICE WORK.",
            "good value for money. accessories like back cover, tempered glass, and stand are available only on amazon. you won't find it in flipkart or local market. please check model number correctly before ordering accessories.",
            "Bought last week. Performance is ok. Audio is so so, it could have been better. Touch is nice. 7000 mA battery is sufficient for 10 inch Full HD screen. Front camera satisfactory. Rear one is good for scanning documents. Haven't tried any games. Very useful for online classes.",
            "Pros.: Big sceen. Decent battery not exactly upto 7000 mah mark..but average decent i would say. 3gb ram is a plus in this range.Performance is also decent. Value for money.\n\nCons. Slow charging time. No android 10. Earphone sound quality through 3.2 mm jack not great at all.Camera not upto the mark.Speaker on the softer side too.\n\nIdeal for multimedia consumption & reading ebooks .",
            "I liked it in all ways possible\nIt provides service as much as it says do.\nHas very good speakers, i listen audio stories and watch movies without the need of any speakers\nDisplay is quite nice for this price\nIs a bit heavy so needs cover for protection\nI use it mostly for reading watching videos and playing light games\nBattery lasts all day in mediocre use\nCamera is good but the only missing thing is it doesn't have flash\nA very good tab at this price. Go for it",
            "This tab is basically for juniors to attend online classes and play couple of games because camera quality is average but zoom calling is acceptable. Sound is loud enough for meetings. Display is good and processor is average without lags. Battery life is good but no fast charging. Overall considering price, I choose this over Samsung A7. Got it for 11,599 only under offer.",
            "If you are looking at M10, look very carefully at the product specification, you'll find multiple variants that are cheaper than this.\n4 points on this product from a specs point of view to compare with other models:\n1. Higher RAM -3GB\n2. Better battery -7000mhA\n3. Higher pixel cameras -8MB/5MB\n4. Snapdragon 450 Octacore (as per various review sites slightly better than 429 quad core)\n5. 1200x1920 (Full HD) resolution\n\nWhat's not in:\n1. 4G LTE (if you want it to have its own data connectivity)",

            "Good for online classes. Camera is good, display is very nice, battery while using power saving mode last for long. Over all good purchase for daily uses like video watching ,net surfing and online classes.",

The update is of almost 3.5 gb.\n\nI have played Asphalt 9 legend on it without any lag ,hanging.",
            "Great tablet overall. Value for money. Don't expect it to be very fast, as it has only 3 GB Ram. The display and sound quality is awesome..!! Charging takes a bit more time than usual, but not much of a problem. Great build quality, as expected from Lenovo. All in all, it's a great buy.",
            "Very poor battery... You can use it only for a 5-6 hrs and then it takes almost 5-6 Hrs for complete charging.. the adapter also gets very hot while charging... Not worth buying... I am not happy with overall experience.. touchscreen is also not very responsive... Please don't buy...",
            "I bought this tablet a month back for my daughter's online classes. Starting of with good things, I will give full marks to the screen. Screen on this tab produces pretty good colors and gives a really nice experience while watching movies. Battery life is good. Screen on time ranges between 7 to 9 hours which includes Google meet, YouTube videos etc. Processor performance is average at best. For day to day mild tasks such as browsing , movies etc, processor does its job just fine. This tab is not meant for heavy gaming.\n\nComing to the not so good points. I'm unable to get android updates no matter what troubleshooting steps I try . Tab is still stuck at Android 9 version. Charging time is on the higher side, takes a good 3 hours to charge fully. As other reviewers have mentioned , app such as Google meet crashes randomly. I have started using the web version of Google meets to work around the problem.\n\nTo sum it up, for the price i paid (12k) this is probably the best tablet available in the market for basic computing needs with an excellent screen.",
            "Very good tablet ,excellent camera , good screen, fairly good speed with 4 G , good looking , light weight idle for students for online classes",
            "Good Display, 3GB RAM is good for even light gaming and functions smoothly. This tab is of decent build . Hate that it has micro usb instead of usb C. The battery is below par and behaves more like a 4000 mah than 7000 mah. Sound quality is just ok for the price. You have to turn up the sound using the Dolby app for sufficient loudness.",
            "It's a very good tab display, sounds is so nice I am using for on-line classes. Overall it's nice tab.",
            "Past one year using this tab. It's a great experience. Watching movies, reading books and using for other purpose. I am totally satisfied to use this versatile set.",

And Touch response and Build Quality (Premium) is exactly the same like an Apple Ipad or even better... Amazing fast and responsive.\n\nThe only cons I found its camera quality. Decent like a 14000 tab. Otherwise, no issues.\n\nI am really surprised how lenovo can give it for only 14000... hats off!!! You can only compare it with high end Samsung S8 or S7 or Apple iPad.....\n\nA must buy.... Rating is 10 out of 5..... 5 extra just for the pricing. This device should cost atleast 25000 rs. .... For 14000 it's a Jackpot or Lottery....",

Full charging comes for 2 Days\n(Usage of 2 to 3 Hrs/ day on average. No Videos, No Games, No Movies,Just browsing only)\nTouch response: It is OK.

            "The product description (WiFi only model) states that it has expandable memory via SD card. Due to this I bought an SD card seperately from here (which is also useless now). The tablet has one SIM/SD card slot which is locked & doesn't open with a pin opener (basically its the Data+ WiFi unit with the slot locked, pin wasn't provided which should have been first sign of the issue, in fact nothing provided except charger). I wouldn't have bought it if description said memory couldn't be expanded. As it is, out of 32gb internal memory you get ~28gb & after OS & pre-installed stuff you get <25gb. Moreover most system apps don't show on tab (except Camera), so you need to download everything, further reducing the space available. It says \"fast charging\" but first full charge took ~6 hours. Its 8mp camera gives grainy images. Far from VFM @13K (& you have to buy screen guard/accessories seperately). Manufacturer & Flipkart are just busy cheating the customer together via hiding info/providing misinformation. Taking advantage of people ordering from home during the pandemic. UPDATE - post usage for couple of days - its USP was 7000mAH battery which is horrible, it performs worse than my 4000mAh phone. It claims Fast charging which is false - takes 5-6 hours for full charge. Doesn't work like a 3gb RAM tab should. Have had to put it on battery saver permanently within 4 days. Cheated of 13K (+ addn money spent on accessories since nothing was provided). If this is the best rated tab in sub 15K price then there's no hope for anyone.",

Also good for watching movies as in Netflix, prime etc.\n6. Touch is also good.\n\nCons:\n1. Processor is not as i expected it to be. It hangs sometimes and application says : this app is not responding I don't know why and that's a thing to be considered.\n2. Storage is not that good. I haven't even added any memory card uptill now but yet if i talk about its internal storage system apps take a lot space and not that good unless i use external card.\n3. Heats a little when used for a long time continuously or when on charging.",
            "Display is good and big.\nFront camera is good , back cam is just ok.\nSound quality poor.\nBattery takes some time to charge.",

            "The tablet is good. With 10in and FHD, display is nice. I purchased it for online classes and it worked very well. I tried stretching it's performance by using high intensity apps, and it did not lag much.\n\nRecently it started rebooting automatically without any reason which is bit of concern. I searched on net and found that others have faced similar issues.\n\nApart from this, the tablet is really good and value for money. I would recommend to go for it if you cannot find similar or better alternative at this price point.",
            "Have been using for a few weeks... Doesn't have any defects till now... The often update is quite annoying.. But now I blocked the notification for update.. Soo the tablet is working quite smoothly.. Also using a 64gb sd with it..",
