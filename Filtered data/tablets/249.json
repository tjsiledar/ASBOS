            "Good Tab for normal usage. Value for money... Worth buying.... This type of yba need fast charger and fast charging support",
            "i m using this tab from last 2 weeks & find it useful for moderate usages such as reading , music quite good with Dolby , battery is tremendous , display for 720p videos only not full HD videos , overall it is Worthy in this price range.",
            "This is a must have in every student's essentials specially for how compact it is and how easily it can be carried anywhere.It is so lightweight and slim that it easily fits in my handbag.The screen-size and ratio is genuinely awesome.Reading e-books or watching course videos and movies have a different kind of feel now,solely because of the screen-size and dual speakers which gives an enriched viewing experience.No matter how much I watch videos or read articles, this device ain't gonna give up easily because of its massive 5100 mah battery.For students,it isn't possible for us to charge the device quite a few times in a day but I think I got the perfect solution for it.The Samsung Galaxy A8 which doesn't give up before one and a half days even with over usage.The performance is pretty smooth with its 2GB RAM and its expandable memory is just terrific,512GB.It makes sure we never run out of memories.The kids mode is another feature that won my heart.My 11 year old brother can use it too and me and my parents will have the assurance that he ain't being the victim of any cybertrap as we are the ones who decide what he's gonna see and for how much time.Lastly it's camera is too awesome.With an 8mp,it clicks crisp and clear images of every memorable moment of our lives.Overall the Samsung Galaxy A8 tablet is an absolute blockbuster product.I would recommend this to every school/college going student as it will help them not only with their studies but will help create a better image of themselves because of its style that carries a classic atmosphere with itself.",

Me,being a college student,a tab was almost something which had become necessary and I was hunting down the internet to find the best fit until I came across this device. It is so compact and light weight that it can easily fit in my college bag; I can work all night on my project without any hassle, thanks to the huge screen and brillant clarity. The processor is pretty good and it doesn't lag whil I stream through YouTube videos. Another great feature of this tab is dual speaker which is pretty loud and clear. In all a perfect tab for all my requirement :D",

I can watch 3 movies straight with a full charge. And 2GB RAM for this tablet is really good for multitasking. The speakers are super loud and clear. Kids mode is amazing as my personal data is safe when I give this tablet to my little brother. The processor is very fast and responsive. It is amazing to play my favourite games. The camera quality is decent. Pictures are clear and the quality of front-facing camera during video calls is really good. Samsung's new One UI is very informative as it is very easy to use the device with one hand now. overall a really good product and I would highly recommend this tablet.",

            "GALAXY TAB A 8.0 is light weighted and a handy tab. Easy to carry while travelling. Fast processor woth Quad core and 2GHz is superfast and multitasking is awesome. With battery backup of 5000mAh, it lasts all day and even some more. Awesome camera quality on both frint and rear side. Big screen size of 8 inch with best viewing angles makes it a great product to watch movies with friends and good sound quality speakers makes it even better. 2GB of ram and a Quad Core Processor running 2GHz speed makes multitasking amazing. I am really happy with this product especially at this price range is amazing value for money, highly recommended",
            "Writing this review after 10 months of thorough usage.\n*Design :\nAluminium back, plastic frame, thick bezels and rectangular shape. A typical samsung 2018 design.\nIt doesn't look extraordinary but still it looks premium, feels pricier.\nI would suggest you to go with the silver color as it looks premium.\n*Display:\nA tft display with a low resolution. Yes the resolution is low and pixelation is evident but at this price you just can't complain.\nViewing angles are good, and colors look natural.\nOnce you get used to it you will not feel it but yes the display resolution is poor by today's standards.\n*Performance :\nThis tab is just for basic tasks like online classes, reading pdfs and media consumption.\nIt has a dated Snapdragon 425 quad core processor with 2 gigs of ram. Yes a quad core in 2021 \ud83d\ude02\nIt can handle day to day tasks fine but don't expect it to perform amazingly.\n*Software :\nIt is currently running Android 11 with one ui 3.1\nSamsung is the king of updates, my smartphone is stuck on android 10 but this meagerly powered tab is running Android 11 with latest security patch.\nGood job Samsung \ud83d\udc4c\n*Battery :\nThis is where this tab truly shines.\nAmazing battery life, 14hr plus of screen time.\nI do 6hr online classes everyday and it lasts me 2 days easily.\nCharging is slow via the 7.5w charger that Samsung bundles in the box, although the tab supports 10W charging.\n*Camera :\nJust does the job.\nRear camera can take good photos in ample sunlight, but who takes photos with a tab ?\nFront cam is fine for video calls and online classes.\n*CONCLUSION :\nThis is the best budget tab for students and binge watchers.\nCheers!",
            "I'm so in love with this tablet. It basically comes up in two colors: silver and black. Both colors are supercool and the tablet looks extremely amazing! It is lightweight and easy to carry. Being in college you can't really carry that heavy laptop everyday but a tablet can be carried easily. I love how now I am able to do all my engineering software work on this tablet with ease. The 5100 mAh battery lasts for my entire day even after using this tablet all the time. It's got 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage which I guess is more than enough for me. Moreover the sd card slot provides us with a 512GB storage. Then there's this cool feature of Samsung kids which is amazing for all of my younger siblings and their entertainment. It's safe for kids and offers educational stuff for quick learning. The camera's got a 8mp resolution while the screen size extends upto 20.31 cm(8\"). It's got dual speakers wherein the quad core cpu type offers a 2GHz speed and is quick enough to display the apps easily. The best tablet I've ever come across and basically is a must buy product! \u2764\ufe0f",
            "it is one of of the best tab with an incredible battery backup it is insane as it has 5100mah battery so it can work up to 2 days also means you can watch videos and play games like pubg for many hours . the speakers are excellent as it is very loud and clear the display of 8 inch is a big enough for all many multimedia needs it has a latest Android which is Android 9.0 pie and with One UI. It is very easy to use the tablet with one hand .\noverall it is a really good product for his price and I recommend everyone who is looking for a tab to get this one.",
            "I purchased this device few days back on Flipkart and I'm really happy to make a smart decision. Samsung A 8.0 tab is just the perfect fit for anybody who is looking to purchase a tab in a budget of under 10000. Few features like dual speakers, large screen, lightweight, attractive looks are all checked in my personal checklist while choosing a tablet.\n\nI usually work on college projects and hence I wanted a tablet with a huge screen and a lightweight machine which could be carried to college everyday. Additionally, the battery which is actually a beast (5100 mAh) helps me to use the tablet for hours and hours without getting drained. I am not a great photographer though but the camera in this tab is pretty cool as well and the photos clicked come out beautiful.\n\nTalking about streaming my favourite shows on Netflix was definitely fun since the colours are pretty vibrant. Getting all this for 10,000 Rs. is definitely a dream come true.",
            "Firstly I am buying a tablet for the first time and I would like to share my experience. Buying this Samsung A 8.0 is amazing. I have taken this tablet for my sister who is, all the time, watching series and I thought of buying this tablet for her and because of the Kids Mode feature, it is very handy. Secondly, this is so comfortable to carry everywhere as it is lightweight. The battery of 5100mAh is so extra amazing. My sister also carries this to the school for her project work. She also loves it and even the price of this tablet is so reasonable. The Dual Speakers have Dolby Atmos which makes the sound quality, very clear. It is an amazing product to buy from Flipkart",
