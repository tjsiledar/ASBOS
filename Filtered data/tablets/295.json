            "This is the best laptop I have seen in this price range. Also not mentioned in the description it comes with a pen and the pen attaches itself magnetically to the back of the laptop. I am currently working on this one connection VMware to access my virtual environment for work , running queries on Hadoop without any issues. I also play some old and new games like fear2, guild of dungeonering, samurai zero, don't starve without any issues. I also draw some cartoons on this as a hobby, the response is perfect , I also own an apple ipad and apple pencil I can very rarely tell a difference, I am fond of manga style and I draw manga on both without any issues. I don't know why more people don't use this laptop.\n\nPros (128 gb version)\n1. Touch sensitivity.\n2. No fans blowing hot air.\n3. Laptop, tablet hybreed.\n4. Perfect to carry in small bag.\n5. Can do office work and play light games , watch hd movies without any issues.\n6. Battery last for 6 to 8 hrs even after playing games for an hour.\n7. Comes bundled with Lenovo pen which is really good and I do a lot of sketches and manga.\n8. Takes any size sd card, so memory is pretty fast depending on the sd card type chosen, it comes with samsung evo 128gb inbuilt which is pretty fast already.\n9. Best you can get at this price range,\n10. This is not the old celeron processor, this is a new celeron launched just a year back so the processor speeds are pretty good.\n\nCons\n1. Laptop is surprising heavy for its size. Good thing is you can get good wrist work out on this one do some reps.",
            "Using product for last 15 days...\nWorking excellent and meeting satisfaction beyond expectations ...\nThe seller and the Flipcart both have done good job with product they delivered faith as well as satisfaction..",
            "Excellent design. Sturdy built. Has a premium look and feel. Do not expect wonders out of it since it has limited processing power and RAM, but the presence of solid state storage gives it a certain fluidity in day-to-day tasks such as browsing, using Word, Excel, PowerPoint, watching movies, etc. The display and sound are also on-point. Overall, very good device. Worthy of a 5-star rating.",
            "One of, if not the best 2 in 1 laptops available in this price range. Stylus for the laptop is also included in the box. Very satisfied with this purchase. Delivery was faster than expected. Packaging was great too.",
            "Superb Device\nFrom the configuration and considering price its a worth buy for me.\nI was planning to buy lenovo duet chromebook then i have gone through this model and finalized this one as this is a windows tablet cum laptop and native windows apps can be used on this.\n128 GB of storage is sufficient for OS.\nI have installed additional 128 GB sd card and installed the applications on that one so the space on c drive will be largely available.\n\nFrom the price point i dont see any cons.\n\nOne to mention when using as laptop mode if we tilt the screen then some times the connection is lost for the keyboard but its not everytime and can be ignored.",
            "It works as expected. Purchased at 25k. Around 84 gb space was free to use after installing some basic apps.(128gb model)\nPen is also included even though not mentioned in description.\n\nI would say best 2 in 1 product in market currently at this price range.\n\nOne thing I did not like is screen bezel are really big.",
            "A 10.1 inch LAP-TAB\nIt's good for minimalist use of computer like good for playing games and making notes with pen in tablet mode\nAnd in desktop mode bite amazing\nThe only low point would be nit having a great processor or much ram\nAnyways it's perfect for my dad he loved it and I can use it too for writing like I'm writing in paper.\nThe feel is not so good but it's just fine and I'm happy with this little guy",
            "Does the job. My child uses this for her online classes and it is able to support that use case. Certainly the processor and the RAM aren't even close to being enough for multi tasking but are decent enough with regard to their performance. I wish the hinge could've been a little more sturdy that could support a prolonged use but is okay and does the job. Please do not expect this to ever work as a laptop for an adult.",
            "A decent tablet cum laptop. Good for elementary basic work. Hangs a bit if lots of chrome tabs or office files are open in parallel.\n\nGood tablet overall, very nice design and usage. Go for it if usage is at low to medium level. Stylish looks comes with the stylus which is a plus.",
            "Stylus/pen is included with 128gb variety, though nothing is mentioned on the package. No sim slot. Best 2in 1 in budget section. Can be used as drawing tab. Very happy with initial impression. Fingers crossed for long run.\n.\n.\n.\nAfter one year of use, I'm pretty sure this is the best basic level complete package (keypad+touchpad+digital stylus with pressure sensitivity) Windows tablet. It's perfect for teaching in online classes. I teach anatomy in medical college & believe me it's the most efficient, most economic option.",

            "Really nice product. The flexibility of tablet and laptop is seamless and very use. First impression: Smooth functioning, no lags. The body is getting slightly heated during charging but I guess happens with many devices. The stylus has some lag but works fine with its own software. Go for it if you are looking for lighter device than a laptop and more versatile than a mobile.",
            "very good for normal work live browsing watching videos office work pen is not much good in writing you need to write slowly with pen other things works fine",
            "This is such a real Windows tablet. It comes with keyboard with automatic magnetic attachment. Genuine Windows 10 home edition. 128Gb version comes with a lenovo active pen which is not mentioned in description. Touch screen is very nice with great response. Storage can be extended by micro SD card.",
            "PRO-\n- Good product. very sleek, stylish and sophisticated\n- Extremely compact, perfect for traveling\n- Super fast boot time. No lag, no hang or latency\n- Bright screen, and would advice to buy an anti-glare screen as well\n- Connects with internet super fast\n- Availability of Microsoft store and can conveniently download everything\n- Am able to download and connect VM Horizon and is conveniently doing WFH\n- The stylus works perfectly fine and precise and responsive\n- Comes with MaCafe for 1 month, post that you will have to purchase\n- I am not a heavy user for this laptop as I purchased this only for office work and Citrix connectivity. How will it be performing for gaming, coding or video editing, am not sure, as I usually use iPad and is more habituated with IOS operating system than Windows\n\nCons-\n- Keyboard is too compact, hence initially will be making a lot of typo as we need time to get used to\n- The monitor is heavier than the keyboard.. as the processor is inside the tab monitor\n- No backlight on the keyboard makes it difficult to type in darker corners of the room",
            "Update take long time, processing is slow, hangs in between multiple applications at browser, not much apps to support as windows OS.\nPreferred a tab come laptop so opted for it...\n\nWould say only handy as tablet come typing- not happy with processing speed, my mobile is faster compared to this with same spec.",
            "Value for money. Overall a good product from Lenovo at this price.",
            "Product is good . Very handy.",
            "It's perfect tab cum laptop to perform all works with same efficiency as with laptop. Battery capacity backup is about 10 hours, very slim and light weight. And importantly it support standard USB port for external hard disk. It's drawback is, it's MS office is not a licensed version. So always ask to activate it. In this price range it should have a activated ms office as other Laptops come with.",
            "Simply amazing, slightly heating on Gaming, tab is more weight when compared to keyboard",
            "Best at this price, premium look, display.",
            "This product is a waste of money.\nKeyboard started to trouble and when I contacted flipcart & lenovo for service , they made me realise that keyboard is part of accesory and it's warranty has already expired.\n1 year Warranty is only for tablet, 6 months Warranty for accesories.\nBut it's my mistake trusting the brand and flipcart.",
            "The worst product and my suggestion is not to buy from flipkart because it is difficult to replace the product.",
            "I broke my screen accidentally after 3months of purchase .... could not find a replacement anywhere... was ready to pay for it... but not available with lenovo also... had to trash it",
            "Value for money and i didn't expected pen which was also included in the box.. works like charm. It is overall value for money.",
            "Very nice ,\ud83d\udc4c",
            "Surprised at how smooth it is with a Celeron processor. And yes, it comes with active pen/stylus for anyone who need this information.",
            "Very nice product. Got as expected.. Fast delivery",

            "Bang for your bucks. A 4gb android tablet without the keypad and pen costs as much if not more. I researched a bit before buying this for my kids online zoom classes, a bit of browsing and basic document handling. It does the work perfectly. No lags with multiple browser tabs, a few documents and the meeting in parallel.\nOverall build quality, screen and battery are perfect. Camera is nothing to write home about, but good enough for the online meetings, no complaints there. Speaker volume is low, you will need headsets or an external speaker. Headphone port, usb port, bluetooth, wifi, and usb c type charging port, you got it all. The keyboard attaches to the tab easily, and is very comfortable and compact.\nDuring leisure hours, convert it to a tab and enjoy your web series. The tab makes it a bit top heavy when using it as a laptop, but it holds the screen comfortably at any desired angle.\nThe form factor is very nice, compact and classy. You will get second glances.\nLook elsewhere if you want to perform intensive processing or play resource consuming games.",
