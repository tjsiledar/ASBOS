I had doubts about the graphic since I will be getting the M10 (HD), but to my surprise the performance is awesomely good.

Tab showed some android system failure twice in 2 days, after it was reset to factory settings on second day, it seems to be working fine till now(another 3 -4 days of buying).\n3) I raised a request for replacement, but after talking to them for many times, I understood I am wasting my time.\n4) Tab takes 4 hrs at least for full charge with the charger provided.\n5) You can create multiple profiles in the tab, I created one for my 7 year old daughter.
