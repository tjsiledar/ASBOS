            "Extremely happy about the product! Prompt delivery by flipkart.\n\nUPDATE: Charging time 19% to 90% took 2hrs for 5100 mah backup which is not good also not bad. Its upto users perspective. But battery management is awesome.\nScreen resolution is slightly lesser (1920x 1200px) than FULLHD so you can see black bars in top and bottom when watching any streaming videos online.\n\nPros:\nBattery, speakers, screen while watching videos and movies.\nWiFi connectivity is awesome. No lag.\n4Gb RAM and 128gb storage for this price (comparison with overpriced Samsung tablet)\nNo heating issue even while charging in Dock and videos are running (not recommended though)\n\n2 charging options - Dock with micro USB and Type C charge port in tablet for direct charging is an added advantage both are charging at good speed.\n\nGoogle Home support is awesome.\n\nCons:\nLenovo should improve the software. Though it gives pure android experience, icons are not crisp but while watching video screen it is amazingly clear. So it's a software improvement which lenovo should do. It's 2020 May month manufactured but still android 9. Fingers crossed for next upgrade.\n\nOverall worth value for the money paid. JUST GO FOR IT!!!!",
            "After using it for two weeks, I think I qualify for writing this review. I will writrle in easy 3 parts - good, bad and ugly, as per today's standard user expectancy. I won't write much a about performance as its widely understandable that no one buys this to play Pubg, mostly this is for schooling and for that, this tab has more than enough for \"everything\".\n\nGood.\nBiggest part, it was available in stock, since \"schooling from home\" is new normal, there was no \"good\" tablet available.

It fullfill your laptop need while you are outstation.\nI recommend for it if someone need it.\nGo for it.",
            "Everything is good except battery backup, sound and voice call connectivity.\nBattery backup - Must be fully charged to attend all school classes. 4-5 classes.\nSpeaker- Sound is easily audible in normal home environment but seems a bit low if others are talking nearby. Also sound lacks loudness.\nCall connectivity- It supports voice call over VOLTE I think. But many times calls connects but sound is not audible of the person talking through this device.",
            "Writing this review after 10 days of usage.\nPros:\n- Solid full metal body\n- 10.3' Narrow bezel FHD display, crisp and clear\n- Smart dock charger (MicroUSB) + Type-C charger in Tab\n- 4GB RAM + 128 GB storage in this price range\n- Supports voice call. And 4G video calls through JioCall app\n- Decent camera for video calls\n- Loud and clear stereo sound with Dolby Atmos\n- Battery lasts 5-6 hours of moderate use\n- No heating issues whatsoever\n- No lag or connectivity problems\n- Google Assistant and Kids Mode\n\nCons:\n- No HD support for OTT apps like Prime, Hotstar, Netflix. But YouTube looks awesome in 1080p though. So it's not the hardware issue (Lenovo may be able to resolve this with an updated WideVine certification in the next OTA version - Hopefully)\n- No fast charging, takes 4 hours minimum to charge it full and 1 hour of video call drains almost 25% of battery\n- Accessories like Case or Screen guards are not available as of today as this tab is very new to the global market.\n\nVerdict: Value for money tab - Great specs and very solid build. If it gets HD support enabled for OTT platforms, it will be a game changer for entertainment usage in this price range.",
            "The tablet is a decent configuration and works fine. My son has been using it for his zoom classes, and for online games and it is working well. No lag or hazy images.\nThe calling function is cumbersome due to the size.\nBattery life is OK, he has to charge it twice a day due to heavy usage. (4hrs of online classes+2 Hr of gaming +1 Hr of fitness class)\nI am. Happy as the other options available now have half the RAM and a quarter of the storage space for about the same price.\nI will recommend it for others as well.",
            "Bought for my child to attain online classes , finding it very easy and comfortable with smart stand cum charger . nice product worth buying \ud83d\udc4c",
            "Everything is fine except battery, which I wish, should have been around 7000mah.It is excellent for reading and viewing films and videos.Google Assistant is responsive. For Rs.21000 it is value for money.Lenovo was quick to upgrade Android to 10 immediately after activation of the tab. Satisfied till now; The real performance would be known after using it for atleast three months.",

If it gets HD support enabled for OTT platforms, it will be a game changer for entertainment usage in this price range.",
            "The tablet is a decent configuration and works fine. My son has been using it for his zoom classes, and for online games and it is working well. No lag or hazy images.\nThe calling function is cumbersome due to the size.\nBattery life is OK, he has to charge it twice a day due to heavy usage. (4hrs of online classes+2 Hr of gaming +1 Hr of fitness class)\nI am. Happy as the other options available now have half the RAM and a quarter of the storage space for about the same price.\nI will recommend it for others as well.",

            "Everything is fine except battery, which I wish, should have been around 7000mah.It is excellent for reading and viewing films and videos.Google Assistant is responsive. For Rs.21000 it is value for money.Lenovo was quick to upgrade Android to 10 immediately after activation of the tab. Satisfied till now; The real performance would be known after using it for atleast three months.",

The docking stand with additional charger is a unique feature.Camera is Ok, display is good, and sound quality and degree of loudness also is very good.\nSo far I havent experienced any lag. The best part is battery backip which lasts for around 5 hrs upon continuous usage.Overall a good buy for a tablet in the budget of somewhere around 20K.",

Most disappointing was the delivery time and the help of flipkart. I urged to deliver is a.s.a.p as 8 needed it for work emergency. But all the request went to deaf ears. Even though the seller shipped the product in time almost on 1 day yet flipkart just sat and waited for delivery date to come which was in my case one week.

Battery could have been bigger doesn't last longer than 6 hours on moderate use\n2.charging is pathetically slow when other brands working on 108W charger lenovo sticks to 10W. It takes exactly 2.5 hrs when u switch off your tab and 3-4 hrs while using the tab.\n3.the tab is very hot I mean it is always heating slightly for no reason even if I use only wynk music\n4.there is a problem in mic, when Google assistant is turned on then mic doesn't works in calls either u restart your tab before calling or disable Google assistant.\n5.my tab has frozen issue 3 times guess what I was doing just reading Google feeds.\nConclusion-\nYou can definately buy this tab if your requirements are watching movies and for studying online but don't think that you can play heavy games on it.its worthy buying it as entertainment tablet.",

Very good touch feedback, no lag (4gb ram)\n3. Viewing angles are very good. The charging dock further allows you to have video conferencing in a hands-free way.\n4. Bluetooth, wifi, 4g sim connectivity including voice calls via 4g sim are very good.\n5. Multiple user login accounts and kids mode are good options if you want to use it as a family entertainment device.\n6. Sound and battery backup are very good.

The battery back up works a good 5-6 hours on low to dim backlight. The higher the screen lighting the less battery back up. My advice: once done with a class and you have a break dim the light to preserve the battery.\nOne con of this device that really affected me is the lack of a stylus which makes me a little handicapped as I am a teacher and a stylus compatible to this device could help me correct the way we would correct notebooks at school.\n\nAll in all, a good choice for someone who can't shell out 32-33 grand for a tab like Samsung.",
