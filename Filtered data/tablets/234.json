            "I was using this tab for past 1 week, my experience is literally great.\nFirst of all the display, it was so good bcoz of the 120hz refresh rate, Ram I think samsung show provide 8gb variant in India, Sounds are really awesome...quad speakers, Camera is ok, For regular use battery stands for 6-8hrs, stand-by is good. S pen is awesome with low latency, over all truly it is a multi tasking monster can't compare with ipad pro but still It can compete with apple through some 3rd party applications",
            "Must buy\nGreat device with beast performance and ultra smooth writing experience with super cool S pen.\nit's always better to write on this except papers.\nI have been completely fallen in love with it.\nAnd yeah i haven't found any cons for this particular device but this one has a decent camera don't expect too much for camera results\nPros.\n(Display) there's no comparison.\nIt has Quad HD resolution with 120Hz screen refresh rate.\n(Processor) it has latest and greatest processor Snapdragon 865+ on 3.09 ghz clock speed with based on 7 nm architecture",
            "Straight out this is a really amazing product. I had done almost a month of research before narrowing down on this piece of hardware. I have a unique use case but i think most of what i do is what is done by most out there. I wanted to save on my expenses for a laptop and a phone. Specifically wanted to have a move around phone plus laptop. There are some options out there but nothing with the sheer power of this 865 plus chipset with that many cores.\n\nI log into remote servers, edit and update documents, attend tons of zoom and GOTOmeetings and web exes. And i also consume media. Not so much gaming or into photo graphs at the moment. But maintaining 2 separate devices for these use cases along with the usual android mobile banking and ecommerce applications, is a real pain. The phone is not sufficiently powered if i need a huge battery and if it does have a heavy battery and very good specs, it costs a bomb and Icant do office stuff on it.\n\nBOOM! Enter Tab s7 plus. A tablet with 4g and 865 plus processor. snap a keyboard cover on with a 45 watt power brick and u have a mobile workstation that doesnt cost like the HP dragonfly and at the same time can put the macbooks or asus laptops in the proce brackets to the shame. I dont have a gaming requirement so the adreno is just fine for any graphic requirement. I cant expect a similar performance from a chromebook at the pricepoint. I believe i have just landed the perfect marriage between performance, pricepoint, utility for a laptop and a phone.\n\nBefore I thank you there are 4 CONS.\n1. The price should have given me a 8GB variant.I am sorely pi$$ed\n2. the rear camera and the mics can definitely be upped a coiple of notches.\n3. There needs to be a 3.5 mm jack for all my legacy devices.\n4. I need to defiinitely get a hdmi connector jack from a USB C like the one u shipped with the S10 e.\n\nOtherwise, you nailed it samsung.",
            "Excellent tablet from Samsung... display is super premium...and ultra smooth . Can't complain about battery as it has a 10000 mah battery . I was surprised with its camera ...as a tablet it shoots wonderful pictures . & I'm in love with the Dex mode.",
            "Great product and great performance. UI is very smooth. very good battery life. And the best pact is it doesn't heat. Samsung should have provided a 25W or 45 W charger in the box.",
            "Flagship Tablet for a reason. You will simply enjoy the super AMOLED screen which is crystal clear and the feel of touch is simply superb. Dolby quad speakers produce loud high quality audio and you will definitely love to watch action movies with high volume.\nI mainly bought this for reading purpose along with occasional entertainment of movies, games. SPen is definitely the highlight here and it simply makes Note taking more enjoyable. Battery life is boon when you want to read for longer ...\nREAD MORE",
            "Pros - Amazing Display , Great Battery life , Smooth motion with 120 Hz refresh rate , Slim and lightweight , Ability to operate in Dex mode like a laptop , Sim and Micro SD slot, S-pen included for notes.\n\nCons - Fast Charger not included , Samsung Dex does'nt support all apps like Netflix, Prime etc properly. Work needs to be done to optimise them. Could have given 8 GB RAMand 256GB storage at this price.\n\nKeyboard Cover has to be purchased separately .",
            "Giving my honest review after using it for a week :)\nI found some pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n\n\u2022 Display, the amoled pannel is the best in the market & the 120hz refresh rate just makes its buttery smooth\n\n\u2022 Battery, the 10090 mah battery will easily last you 1-2 days of use and 1 day of heavy use (i would suggest use dark mode to save some battery)\n\n\u2022 Performance, the snapdragon 865+ just takes it all without any hiccups. Plus, there is no heating at all\n\n\u2022 S-pen, it is the main reason many would buy this over ipad air. The latency is near to none, and it just take 2-3 minutes to full charge it and it increases the productivity by a lot\n\n\u2022 One UI Software, it is smooth with no lag-stutters and it's well optimized for tablet, and the feature list is endless\n\n\u2022 Speakers, the AKG tuned quad speaker setup just makes it a multimedia beast\n\n\u2022 Design and build, the all metal build and the flagship design makes it oh so premium and the weight distribution is good which makes it fell lighter than it is\n\n\u2022 The keyboard cover, you don't get it in the box and it cost around 17k, but the productivity and the flexibility of the tab increases by a lot and with the DEX mode you get a laptop like experience\n\n\u2022 Fingerprint scanner, the in-display fingerprint scanner works like a charm. It's works like 9-10 times (Unless you put a screen gaurd)\n\nNow, for some cons....\n\n\u2022 No 3.5 mm jack, it is the main con of this device, you just feel the need of it many times. (Sure, the problem can be solved by buying a adapter, but it just makes it cumbersome to use)\n\n\u2022 It's Thin, this would sound lame but from a practical point of view it's not great. The tab is just 3/4th of the size of the S-pen which makes it a bit fragile.\nI would highly recommend to use a good cover with it\n\n\u2022 S-pen position, the position of S-pen while charging (below the rear camera) makes it a pain, and sometimes irritating. You can't keep your device down, it also comes in the way while holding the tab in the potrait position\n\n\u2022 Charger, the tab supports 45w, but still samsung gives you a meak 15 watt charger in the box which takes more than 3 hours to charge from 0-100\nI would recommend you to buy a 45watt fast charger\n\nNow some things which could be improved (not a pro or con),\n\n\u2022 Camera, ik camera doesn't matter in tablet, and it clicks decent photos. but from a flagship product you expect everything to be good\n\n\u2022 optimization, it's not samsung fault rather it's androids way of optimizing apps. Some apps only work in portrait mode only\n\nOverall you can blindly go for the tab. It will just create a smile on your face :)\nPS: i would highly recommend you to go and check this product in a offline store before buying",
            "One of the best tabs available in the market currently. Super display so it's a eye catcher for those who binge a lot of OTT content. Sound is fantastic with Dalby surround. Processor works absolutely without any lag. S Pen is included which is a big relief and works amazingly well. Touch response is super good. Keyboard and book cover pricing could have been a bit cheaper.\nAlso has a Dextop mode for office work.\nOverall mighty impressed and a must buy",
            "The best Multimedia device in the market..\n\nThanks flipkart for the wonderful deal.. got it for 41k.\n\nWatching movies is this 12\"oled is so satisfying and the speakers are damm good\n\nGetting only 4 hour screen on time in full brightness and takes 2.5 hours for full charge with 25watt charger",

But maintaining 2 separate devices for these use cases along with the usual android mobile banking and ecommerce applications, is a real pain. The phone is not sufficiently powered if i need a huge battery and if it does have a heavy battery and very good specs, it costs a bomb and Icant do office stuff on it.\n\nBOOM! Enter Tab s7 plus. A tablet with 4g and 865 plus processor. snap a keyboard cover on with a 45 watt power brick and u have a mobile workstation that doesnt cost like the HP dragonfly and at the same time can put the macbooks or asus laptops in the proce brackets to the shame. I dont have a gaming requirement so the adreno is just fine for any graphic requirement. I cant expect a similar performance from a chromebook at the pricepoint. I believe i have just landed the perfect marriage between performance, pricepoint, utility for a laptop and a phone.\n\nBefore I thank you there are 4 CONS.\n1. The price should have given me a 8GB variant.I am sorely pi$$ed\n2. the rear camera and the mics can definitely be upped a coiple of notches.\n3. There needs to be a 3.5 mm jack for all my legacy devices.\n4. I need to defiinitely get a hdmi connector jack from a USB C like the one u shipped with the S10 e.\n\nOtherwise, you nailed it samsung.",
            "Excellent tablet from Samsung... display is super premium...and ultra smooth . Can't complain about battery as it has a 10000 mah battery . I was surprised with its camera ...as a tablet it shoots wonderful pictures . & I'm in love with the Dex mode.",
            "Great product and great performance. UI is very smooth. very good battery life. And the best pact is it doesn't heat. Samsung should have provided a 25W or 45 W charger in the box.",
            "Flagship Tablet for a reason. You will simply enjoy the super AMOLED screen which is crystal clear and the feel of touch is simply superb. Dolby quad speakers produce loud high quality audio and you will definitely love to watch action movies with high volume.\nI mainly bought this for reading purpose along with occasional entertainment of movies, games. SPen is definitely the highlight here and it simply makes Note taking more enjoyable. Battery life is boon when you want to read for longer ...\nREAD MORE",
            "Pros - Amazing Display , Great Battery life , Smooth motion with 120 Hz refresh rate , Slim and lightweight , Ability to operate in Dex mode like a laptop , Sim and Micro SD slot, S-pen included for notes.\n\nCons - Fast Charger not included , Samsung Dex does'nt support all apps like Netflix, Prime etc properly. Work needs to be done to optimise them. Could have given 8 GB RAMand 256GB storage at this price.\n\nKeyboard Cover has to be purchased separately .",
            "Giving my honest review after using it for a week :)\nI found some pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n\n\u2022 Display, the amoled pannel is the best in the market & the 120hz refresh rate just makes its buttery smooth\n\n\u2022 Battery, the 10090 mah battery will easily last you 1-2 days of use and 1 day of heavy use (i would suggest use dark mode to save some battery)\n\n\u2022 Performance, the snapdragon 865+ just takes it all without any hiccups. Plus, there is no heating at all\n\n\u2022 S-pen, it is the main reason many would buy this over ipad air. The latency is near to none, and it just take 2-3 minutes to full charge it and it increases the productivity by a lot\n\n\u2022 One UI Software, it is smooth with no lag-stutters and it's well optimized for tablet, and the feature list is endless\n\n\u2022 Speakers, the AKG tuned quad speaker setup just makes it a multimedia beast\n\n\u2022 Design and build, the all metal build and the flagship design makes it oh so premium and the weight distribution is good which makes it fell lighter than it is\n\n\u2022 The keyboard cover, you don't get it in the box and it cost around 17k, but the productivity and the flexibility of the tab increases by a lot and with the DEX mode you get a laptop like experience\n\n\u2022 Fingerprint scanner, the in-display fingerprint scanner works like a charm. It's works like 9-10 times (Unless you put a screen gaurd)\n\nNow, for some cons....\n\n\u2022 No 3.5 mm jack, it is the main con of this device, you just feel the need of it many times. (Sure, the problem can be solved by buying a adapter, but it just makes it cumbersome to use)\n\n\u2022 It's Thin, this would sound lame but from a practical point of view it's not great. The tab is just 3/4th of the size of the S-pen which makes it a bit fragile.\nI would highly recommend to use a good cover with it\n\n\u2022 S-pen position, the position of S-pen while charging (below the rear camera) makes it a pain, and sometimes irritating. You can't keep your device down, it also comes in the way while holding the tab in the potrait position\n\n\u2022 Charger, the tab supports 45w, but still samsung gives you a meak 15 watt charger in the box which takes more than 3 hours to charge from 0-100\nI would recommend you to buy a 45watt fast charger\n\nNow some things which could be improved (not a pro or con),\n\n\u2022 Camera, ik camera doesn't matter in tablet, and it clicks decent photos. but from a flagship product you expect everything to be good\n\n\u2022 optimization, it's not samsung fault rather it's androids way of optimizing apps. Some apps only work in portrait mode only\n\nOverall you can blindly go for the tab. It will just create a smile on your face :)\nPS: i would highly recommend you to go and check this product in a offline store before buying",
            "One of the best tabs available in the market currently. Super display so it's a eye catcher for those who binge a lot of OTT content. Sound is fantastic with Dalby surround. Processor works absolutely without any lag. S Pen is included which is a big relief and works amazingly well. Touch response is super good. Keyboard and book cover pricing could have been a bit cheaper.\nAlso has a Dextop mode for office work.\nOverall mighty impressed and a must buy",
            "The best Multimedia device in the market..\n\nThanks flipkart for the wonderful deal.. got it for 41k.\n\nWatching movies is this 12\"oled is so satisfying and the speakers are damm good\n\nGetting only 4 hour screen on time in full brightness and takes 2.5 hours for full charge with 25watt charger",
            "This is the best product samsung has ever made....Such an amazing tab..Such an amazing performance...\nSeriously Loved it..:)\nThe Amoled display, the screen size And the Dolby sound gives you the theatre movie experience... I suggested this to my friends and after i bought this...5 of my friends also bought this ..and they are happy too..\nThis is the best in the market...Even better than Ipad Pro and its a fact. :)",
            "Very good tablet with value for money. It's very good for productive work with samsung dex and main highlight is you can use this as second screen with windows laptop,it can easily replace laptop who are normal users with surfing and typing",
            "Pros:\n\n1. The OLED panel display with 120Hz refresh rate is a treat to the eyes.\n2. The S-pen stylus is a joy to write with and glides butter smooth on the screen. (Definitely better than the Apple pencil which feels much heavier to use and comes with an additional price of around 12k)\n3. The AKG tuned quad speakers project crispy clear sound with just the right amount of bass. ( The Dolby Atmos option gives a surround sound experience)\n4. Battery is enough to last you one whole day of using DEX, editing, multi-tasking and watching videos. (I don't play games so not considering gaming)\n5. Camera quality actually exceeded my expectations. (Athough nobody uses tablets for photography)\n\n\nCons:\n\n1. Expected 8GB RAM with 128GB ROM variants too.\n2. The DEX software that mimics a proper desktop needs upgradation.\n3. As of now, the Android tablets have lesser pool of App availability than their iOS counterpart.\n4. The 16:10 aspect ratio might be an issue for the one's who have been used to Apple's 4:3",
            "Omg, it's the best Android tablet one can get. Best mentions would be the display(everything just pops out :p) and the quad speaker setup(fkin immersive sound tech). The display is byfar the best display I have ever used and after 15 days I still cnt get enough. The speakers are just insane. I wonder what kind of engineering have been done in collaboration with akg, but the loudness, the clarity and the 3d surround sound cinema like effect these speakers generate is just INSANE. I actually stopped using my 12w Bluetooth speakers, because these are god speakers on any smart device ever, period. Talking of multimedia consumption, multitasking or simply scrolling through social media is utter pleasure. I literally spend like 10 hours a day on this tablet since it has arrived\ud83e\udd23.",
            "This is a great tab. Whoever said that android tabs aren't good for productivity may change his mind after using this one. For my use cases of gaming, media consumption and online classes, this works great. The display, multitasking interface and speakers are just delightful. The camera is so-so in indoor conditions but works great with natural lighting. The phone is very snappy and apps open without any lag owing to the SD 865+ processor. The multi-tasking possibilites are immense props to Samsung DeX (turns UI into desktop-like interface) and also the multi-window features. I hardly use my phone or laptop for productivity purposes after I bought this. (Except for calling and gaming ofcourse.)\n\nGo with this without any second thoughts as there isn't any alternative at this price point.",
            "Great product. A true IPad competitor for Android fans. Amazing integration with Windows OS and Samsung mobile. You can receive video calls after connecting with Samsung phones, file sharing between Windows and Samsung smartphones is seamless and very fast.\nDisplay best any day.\nProcessing is Amazing with 865+ with zero heating.\nSPen is very powerful and realistic.\nBuild is very very premium.\nSamsung has optimized OneUi, especially for Tablets and any application which is in portrait or not full screen yu can force it to landscape and it works nice but its still in Labs so mightnot work with all the application currently. Also, Dex is super useful.\nSo just give a try over Ipad for android users one will surely love it.",
            "Super fast and smooth experience. Handles all day-to-day tasks with ease.\nSamsung could have provided the 8GB RAM with 256 GB ROM in India.\nAdditional Memory card slot is a plus.\nThe camera module could have been better (not important for tablet users).",
            "After one month of use this is An Absolute beast got it for 56k in Big Billion Days. As a pro iPad user I can truly say, A true iPad Pro Killer and more better screen than iPad pro. 120hz screen makes a great experience and an artist expert. Including a pen is a masterstrok by samsung and believe me it's amazing to use it as it has low latency which makes the experience more better. If you are looking for something pro as an artist or for entertainment or gaming, this is the best choice in great budget.",
            "I baught this on holi sale .\nPro's\n1. best display at this segment.\n2. Best camera\n3. Fast face or fingerprint unlock\n4. Best performance but...\n5 . Spen\nCons\n1. Camera is not top notch like ipad air\n2. S pen glitch on side screen\n3. Performance is good but not good for gamer because\nof Android\n4. Heating issu on screen horizontally",
            "I got this on the 5th march and writing revuew after 15 days,\nIf we talk about the camera,\nI havent recorded the video but clicked the pictures,\nThe are amazing after the processing,\n\n2. If we talk about display that is its one of the strong side,\nDisplay is huge and too much impressive,\nAnd as I am Samsung user so addicted to the samsung super amoled displays,\nDisplay is too much comfortable tp use you can use it like the mobile whole day,\n\n3. If we talk about performance it has a superstrong 885 + it can easily handle the BGMI AND PUBG LITE.\nAnd smoothly operate the video editing software.\n\nIf we talk about value for money then it is much better then Ipad air 4,\nWhich along with apple pencil cost about 62 k.\nSo it is performing just amazing",
            "The Quad HD super amoled 120 hz refresh rate with combo of Snapdragon 865 plus is just a treat .One of the best tablet that the market can offer in the current market .The battery life too on cellular network with promotion lasts around anywhere between 6 hrs to 7 hrs .And the camera are way more than average for a tablet .",
            "Hardware is top class... Software needs a huge improvement... Apple ipad pro comes as a winner only because of its camera and operating system.... Can't blame Samsung because it has no control over the android operating system... Anyways great work samsung.... Keep it up...",
            "Loved this product especially for the price i got it\nI am an artist and I needed a digital medium for my art\nThis tab is simply amazing and fits my requirement perfectly",
            "The device really keeps end of its bargain. The display is so fluid, buttery smooth and if you are someone who consume multimedia in Netflix and Prime, you get a whole of HDR + capabilities for rendering videos/pictures giving you top-notch experience. The 120 hz refresh rate just adds up to to the spice.The engine Processor 865 plus is still one of the best in the market and takes gaming experience next level. Although at this price point IPad with M1 Processor is available in the market but you get a limitation of 64gb internal storage. So overall with snapdragon 865+ with 120hz refresh rate, 6gm RAM & 128gb storage brings a much better deal at this price. I use this device for notes writing as well and S pen is the magic wand. There is absolute no lag while you write and it has also on air action features.",
            "I got it for diacount in sale for 55k so considering that its a very good value for money tablet. Sound and display are great. Not taking and drawing are my primary use and overall experience is good so far. Battery backup is also good. I have note 20 5g,that small stylus pen also work with this display. I dont play games so no comments but it can handle general games. Of 6 gb, 4 gb is used and 1 gb is available. Overall i like it and though its launched 2 yrs back and s8 will be launched soon, this tab is still worth it.",
            "Its a nice tablet.\nEsp display..\nI have seen & used 2018 ipad pro.. But the display here is much.. Much better than those..\nEven though they dont match ipad in terms of raw performance. Still its the best android tablet u can currently get on the market..\nIf your needs includes powerpoint presentation & all.. This can replace ur laptop.\nAll though dex mode is oly a half baked cookie( many apps still doesn't support it including instagram), v hope that samsung adds further optimised future updates..",
            "Awesome display. Performance smooth. Especially 120 hz makes it flawless and beautiful. Slim and sleek design. And clear and rich sound delivered by AKG. Value for money.",
            "The display is beautiful. Battery life is about 7 plus hours which is fantastic. Dex works great with keyboards. Honestly the power of this tab is plenty to replace a laptop but the software lacks great applications for photo/video editing. I found no complaints in my one week use. Large and heavy to hold with one hand for longer duration. Reading Kindle books is a treat on this device. It is still expensive if you are looking for a laptop because you need the keyboard cover for proper computer experience. You can easily connect any Bluetooth keyboard mouse with a dongle. No heating issue. Very sleek. Great for media consumption like Netflix and Prime video.",
            "Amazing screen.\n\nThe Highlight this tablet is its screen, it has really vivid display with great contrast and good Color saturation. The 120Hz refresh rate makes an awesome experience to consume media on this screen.\n\nAwesome S-Pen\n\nThe S-Pen is really responsive and feels like writing with real pen on a piece of paper.",
            "If you're a student and want to write notes then apple offers good apps than android, especially if we consider synchronisation but Samsung notes is manageable, it's not that bad.\n\nS-pen: It has a rubberized nib which seems prone to damage but its working fine. For writing notes, actually its good when compared to Apple. Because apple got a plastic tip which is slippery , thanks to s-pen for a rubberized pointed tip.\n\nDisplay: Amazing display. Amoled has its own advantage, vibrant colors but nowadays ips ans lcd displays are too good. Normally one can't find difference unless compared side by side.\n\nPerformance: 865+ is a quite capable processor and Samsung One UI is well optimised.\n\nCamera: Although in a tab camera has not as many functions as in a mobile but at this price range it is average.\n\nSound: Quad Speakers optimised by AKG with Dolby sound- You can't expect more than what it has. It's fantastic.\n\nScreen protection: You will need screen guard because gorilla glass 3 is prone to scratches. At this price range it should have offered a better screen.\n\nCharging is quite slow, thanks to the slow adapter in box.\n\nIf you want to replace your laptop for official work, you need keyboard and mouse. Dex mode is good to work with.",

            "Awesome. Cons and Pros = Display size is Huge",
            "It's a beast. Better to buy this one rather than S8 or S8+",
            "Pros -\n1. Excellent Display, Touch n feel of the screen is Amazing as it uses SuperAmoled display with 120hz refresh rate.\n2. Performance is Good with Snapdragon Processor and 6Gb Ram. As it is new i found no lag in performance, will get to know after some time of usage. Hopeful that performance will continue to satisfy.\n3. Speakers are amazing. It has Quad Speakers tuned by AKG, which are really Great. Gives an amazing experience. Watching movie or vids gets better with the dolby atmos sound. As already the display is great combined with grt sound it becomes a perfect match.\n4. S-Pen also comes in the box, which is a grt deal, it becomes easier to take notes. S Pen performs well, there is no issue in that.\n5. Front Camera or Selfie Camera is Good. It does the job of video calling perfectly.\n6. Battery backup is good. On Moderate usage battery will last for more than a day.\n\nCons.\n1. Battery charging takes a lot of time, almost 3 hrs for a full charge. This is bcoz of the charger given is of only 15watts and the tablet supports upto 45 watts. So you will have to buy a fast charger if you want fast charging.\n2. Back camera is very poor. At this price it should be better. None the less people don't use tablet for taking pictures. It is just used to take the images of the documents.\n\nWorth the buy even in 2022.",
            "Worth buying",
            "V. Good",
            "Like everything about it. Except the very very reflective screen.\nThings I loved: s pen air actions, I don't use it for navigation but controlling music and volume with it is amazing for a lazy person like me.\nDex mode. Though it would've been nice if it didn't close all apps everytime you get in and out of it.\nThe in display fingerprint. Kind of a weird thing to mention, but I didn't even know this had a fingerprint sensor let alone an in display one.\nThe only complaint I have with Samsung is the trackpad keyboard for this tab is nowhere online. When I contacted samsung about this, they said it's currently unavailable and that I should try my luck in offline stores.",

The speakers are amazing.\nIf you are into photography this is not the device and they are not to be blamed for it cause nobody uses tabs for taking pictures.\nIf you are into drawing this is one heck of a canvas. The display is huge with 12.4 inch display and it feels good.\nGaming fells good too. It's just that I felt that it is difficult control such a huge device but with some practice it is highly possible.\nOverall it is a must buy.",
