            "Positives are display quality, easy on eyes for long hour usage, battery backup, sleekness, Samsung security, sound output.\nNegatives (to my opinion) are: A bit slow (at times even hangs for a second or so), Samsung should've given at least 4GB RAM in 22k version but that might have hurt the sales of S6 Lite, not as effective wifi reception as compared to modern mid-range phones still manageable, most important problem that I found (which no one discussed here in reviews or on youtube videos) is that in the LTE version you can avail the calling facility only on loudspeaker mode (tablet's main speakers are used for call output, no inbuilt micro-earpiece as given in phones). So if you want to use it for calling purposes, then an external earphone is must; otherwise everyone around you will be listening to the conversation. This was a big, unpleasant surprise for me.\nStill a pretty much considerable option if you are looking for a table for normal educational and media consumption purposes in and around 20k.\nStill one of the least",

Display also could have been better. Display PPI is poor. Colours and viewing angles are good. Video quality and playback is good. Battery life is also good. In 4G LTE version you can use this as mobile phone. Calling and WhatsApp/Signal are possible with this tablet. All mobile phone apps are compatible. Consider this tablet as a big screen mobile.
