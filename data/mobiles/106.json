            "Writing this after 1 day use -\nBATTERY - 5/5 Battery backup is very good. Also 0-100 in just 1 hour 10 mins\nCAMERA - 2/5 Rear camera works very good in good lighting but when light is low, its horrible. Not like a 108mp.\nFront camera is worse. Selfies look very weird and very warm color.\nI think these will be fixed with software updates.\nPERFORMANCE - 4.5/5 Performance is good. No lags and stutter till now. 90hz works very smooth.\nDISPLAY - 5/5 Display is very good. Colors are vibrant.\nFINGER PRINT SCANNER AND GESTURES -4.5/5 Finger print works good and is fast. The gestures are very good and useful.\nSPEAKER AND HEADPHONES EXPERIENCE - 4/5 Speaker is loud but a stereo speaker would have been better but this one is also gets the job done. Headphone experience is also good.\n\n1 thing I noticed is that the wifi speed never reaches the maximum speed. I have a 30mbps wifi, max speed I was getting was 25-26mbps while in other phones I was getting 30mbps. This is a bit of problem but in normal use it's not noticeable.\n\nIn conclusion I would say that if camera is not your priority and you want a clean software experience, then this phone is perfect you.\nIf camera issues are fixed with update, then this can become a very good allrounder.",
            "I am using this phone from last week... AWESOME EXPERIENCE TILL NOW!!!!\n\nExcellent Phone with all it's features, excellent camera, excellent refresh rate, excellent sound, excellent battery, excellent performance of processor. Don't go with them who are comparing it with other similar but different processor phones, sound is perfect, a small smartphone will not give you like 120w sound output so whatever it's giving is awesome. Super night mode camera. Only missing is Super Amoled display but it's ok. It is a compact phone with a great 108 MP camera and great performance but not up to the mark as stating 108 MP.\n\nSelfie Camera is not upto the mark, the selfie photots are flipped, it looks very odd.h Hope Motorola will take care of this issue in next update.\n\nMacro photos are not looking clear.\n\nCharging time is blazingly fast .\n\nLove the real camera design, it look like an iPhone.\n\nSee some pictures I have taken from my moto edge 20 fusion.",
            "Well I am clean UI midrange user from the earlier. Xperia,Lenovo,Asus were my previous smartphones.I wanted a proper replacement for my Asus max pro m2 as there were no update since two years. It was like a hell to use that backdated ph but the no compromise Sony's sensor and 1.8 aperture. Realme GT Master edition n Moto fusion were my two targets. One of my priority is always a camera. Fusion camera review made me too much confusion but accidentally I placed this order.\n\nI will not elaborate about other features of this ph but the most confusing Camera performance. Well 1st I will like to say that it's aperture is 1.9 so you can't expect better low light performance at night or good bokeh effect at day light. Even I found uneven focusing problems . Bugs in pro mode also need to be fixed. There is a serious problem in when you controlling shutter speed with ISO. Must be fixed.But there is a solution of every problems. Tht is Gcam. You will found the difference. But no option to manually control the camera in Gcam. I have taken so many types shots both at Gcam n system camera during light and day. One thing I can say it can't expect 5 star or even2 star rating for camera performance. It can be managed. As other features of this ph is superb. Last thing they have other high range phs. All good features in midrange ph will definitely effect higher budget ph. So acco to geekyranjit no ph is perfect.\n\nCons:\nBluetooth connectivity problems, problem in auto brightness , screen is not enough bright for outdoor, the number 108 mp makes me irritating every time.\nMost annoying part is high SAR value in this segment",
            "Good Product. Fast Delivery. Best Battery Backup phone. Great Display . Motorola is back in action",
            "The reviews on the product are really deceiving, it a really good product for really good price, the reviews on the camera that are bad are clearly by people who don't know how to use it well.\n1.The device has a 108MP camera and you have to change the settings according to your usage, there is a manual professional mode as well, which is what I used to click the pictures of the moon. The zoom is incredible I had a Motorola before this as well and the camera was great, I'd say the camera quality is comparable to that of Iphone with better zoom and saturation\n2. The ready for PC feature is one of a kind and really good for saving time and you can control your PC with the phone completely wireless\n3. The battery is really good, one charge lasted me two whole days\nAgain, if some people don't know how to use a device doesn't mean it's bad, if you want a full package in a really good price and you have the read the specifications, you'll be happy.",
            "Phone is good for me, who doesn't use much camera, clean UI no issues yet. Happy with battery backup.\n\nI dont have great knowledge about camera but it click decent photos.\n\nI am satisfied with the price and features. om top of that its futurist phone having 13 5g bands.",
            "Edge 20 Fusion is cool enough.... Gives the best performance with its performance..... Except the camera.... The 108mp camera is not at all good.... It can't even focus properly.... It takes 2 to 3 sec for processing the image after taking the photo.... And still you won't be satisfied with it.... Even the selfie camera is not that good.... It doesn't have wide angle feature.... Coming to the video section it does pretty well and it is impressing.... Even the 4k videos are also damn cool.... The speakers are also loud enough....Battery is also good easily usable for 24-30hrs.... The charger is becoming warm while charging... Don't know why.... But it is charging quickly.... Moto people have to provide a gallery.... This phone doesn't have a gallery... Everytime I have to open Google photos to view.... The ready for feature is also superb....

            "I am an engineering student, and I needed a balanced all rounder phone and for me this one was the best pick. I am very much satisfied with this. Whether it be performance , display (too op !!!!), and the software ( it feels very light and smooth), the display is simply amazing. Rear camera performance is descent, only problem is in the front camera's performance. Basically hardware is top notch, no problem with that, the only thing needed is a software update for the front camera performance. I'll edit my comment to 5 star if moto provides update for the camera \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4c\u270c\ufe0f. And yes it has got descent haptics, feels very pleasing. And you actually feel that you have got control over your data, it gives you full privacy, you can really manage all the permissions that apps are accessing. Huge thumbs up for moto's clean software and thinkshield privacy...Trust me guys software matters a lot, don't just compare stuff on the basis of hardware specs.\nHere I am attaching some of the 108 MP rear camera shots and macro shots.\n\n*****EDIT:- So moto did provide with couple of camera updates and it appears to have made things much better. So I am editing my comment to \"5 Star\" as I mentioned. Also you can use the gcam modes which are available now for moto edge 20 fusion to get the results as per your taste.",
            "Reviewing this phone after a week.\nGot this phone at a decent price during sale. So my review is based on comparison with last device I was using which was moto g5s plus. I'm an average user who mostly uses phone for social media and multimedia experience. So my review is from that pov and not of a gamer.\nSo firstly the phone does seem quite big in hand but you'll get used to it and it's not that heavy or hard to handle.\nDisplay is amazing you will love it. Amazing colors. You'll have a great experience watching full hd content.\nBattery is big, though 5000mah it doesn't make phone to heavy to handle and last for 2days under moderate usage and 1 & 1/2 days for heavy usage.\n90hz refresh rate is smooth but I've been using it at 60hz and that's smooth too.(just so that the battery lasts little bit much longer)\nPerformance is great you will love it. No lags or jittering.\nConnectivity is good too.\nCamera is good. Even though I've been reading all the camera related reviews before purchasing it that showed it ain't that grt. I'd say it works great for me. If ain't a photographer or don't click that many photos you will love the camera and won't be disappointed. Yes it needs software updates to improve but it's not worse at all. You can use gcam.\nSpeaker is loud enough. Even while on call you might want to reduce the volume.\nOverall it's a complete package. Value for many. Best phone under this price range. You might not find it very exciting like realme, redmi or poco type but stock Android experience and moto features makes it easy and helpful for daily usage. If you want simple yet smart enough go for it.\nFew things I missed it didn't like;\nFingerprint sensor doesn't lock the phone like my previous device instead it has shortcuts.\nBrightness is not sufficient for outdoor use you will have to set it above 70-80%.\nThat's it, hope this helps you.",
            "This iphone is the very best in its price range. The phone has a lot of hidden features like RAM boost which is enabled by default and not advertised by Motorola as a feature that other mobile brands do. There are a lot of other features like overcharge protection, support for HD audio (which should be enabled in the developer options manually).The display is excellent for this price and so is the battery.

            "Writing this after 1 day use -\nBATTERY - 5/5 Battery backup is very good. Also 0-100 in just 1 hour 10 mins\nCAMERA - 2/5 Rear camera works very good in good lighting but when light is low, its horrible. Not like a 108mp.\nFront camera is worse. Selfies look very weird and very warm color.\nI think these will be fixed with software updates.\nPERFORMANCE - 4.5/5 Performance is good. No lags and stutter till now. 90hz works very smooth.\nDISPLAY - 5/5 Display is very good. Colors are vibrant.\nFINGER PRINT SCANNER AND GESTURES -4.5/5 Finger print works good and is fast. The gestures are very good and useful.\nSPEAKER AND HEADPHONES EXPERIENCE - 4/5 Speaker is loud but a stereo speaker would have been better but this one is also gets the job done. Headphone experience is also good.\n\n1 thing I noticed is that the wifi speed never reaches the maximum speed. I have a 30mbps wifi, max speed I was getting was 25-26mbps while in other phones I was getting 30mbps. This is a bit of problem but in normal use it's not noticeable.\n\nIn conclusion I would say that if camera is not your priority and you want a clean software experience, then this phone is perfect you.\nIf camera issues are fixed with update, then this can become a very good allrounder.",
            "I am using this phone from last week... AWESOME EXPERIENCE TILL NOW!!!!\n\nExcellent Phone with all it's features, excellent camera, excellent refresh rate, excellent sound, excellent battery, excellent performance of processor. Don't go with them who are comparing it with other similar but different processor phones, sound is perfect, a small smartphone will not give you like 120w sound output so whatever it's giving is awesome. Super night mode camera. Only missing is Super Amoled display but it's ok. It is a compact phone with a great 108 MP camera and great performance but not up to the mark as stating 108 MP.\n\nSelfie Camera is not upto the mark, the selfie photots are flipped, it looks very odd.h Hope Motorola will take care of this issue in next update.\n\nMacro photos are not looking clear.\n\nCharging time is blazingly fast .\n\nLove the real camera design, it look like an iPhone.\n\nSee some pictures I have taken from my moto edge 20 fusion.",
            "Well I am clean UI midrange user from the earlier. Xperia,Lenovo,Asus were my previous smartphones.I wanted a proper replacement for my Asus max pro m2 as there were no update since two years. It was like a hell to use that backdated ph but the no compromise Sony's sensor and 1.8 aperture. Realme GT Master edition n Moto fusion were my two targets. One of my priority is always a camera.

There are a lot of other features like overcharge protection, support for HD audio (which should be enabled in the developer options manually).The display is excellent for this price and so is the battery. The default audio settings are not good and should be changed to balanced in the custom audio settings and also turn off surround sound. Once you do that you get excellent audio quality, I use a Spundmagic E11BT and the sound is excellent. The call quality is excellent and pretty loud and clear. The single speak does its job without any fuss. The personalisation options and moto gestures along with the stock android gives an amazing user experience. The only downside is the camera which nerds some work and can be improved with a software update. The default setting of the camera is 12MP,, to enable 108MP you have to enable high resolution in photo settings. This will result in every pic occupying 25-30MB of storage. If you are using a sd card just make sure it's a fast one. Overall very satisfied with the phone.",
            "Moto has worked quite a bit on this one. This one is surprisingly light and has a balanced matte finish on the back. Display is oled 10 bit with striking color contrast and media consumption is very appealing to eye. Processor is 5g compliant and is quite capable in multitasking and gaming too. No heating issue felt so far. 30 watt turbocharger is handy. Battery will last more than a day easily. Camera rear side is decent and gives you pics close to real objects without any added enhancement. Front camera is a bit weak but can be improved with updates. Ready for pc feature is an add on which is cool too. Carrier aggregation and nfc support with headphone jack is very assuring too on this one. Go for it if u need a clean stock Android experience with better display and a capable 5g processor. Regards.",
            "A decent enough phone with its pros and cons which is to be expected from any phone. But it didn't turn out to be as good as I had hoped it would.\nSome compromise were expected, like the all plastic build and lack of sterio speakers. But because of few peculiar cons, this device failed to impress me.\n\nPros:\n1) Clean UI/ Stock Android with some extra features that are actually useful.\n2) Option for optimised charging.\n3) Good enough performance for day to day usage.\n4) Great display*\n5) Not heavy.\n6) Great battery backup + 30 W fast charging\n7) 3.5 mm headphone jack\n\nCons:\n1) Terrible camera sensor and even worse camera app. The camera is easily the worst thing about this phone. It is pretty much useless. The big number (108 MP) does not matter, the resulting images are just awful. I've tried a few 3rd party camera apps, but nothing worked properly. Unless Motorola fixes this with a software update (if it can even be fixed), the camera setup is just USELESS.\n2) Streaming: Can't stream HD content on Prime. (Haven't checked on Netflix yet, will update it when I do) Even though this device has Widevine L1 certification, but can't stream HD content. Also, NO HDR capabilities.\nThe phone also does not stream 10bit content. No point in having a 10 bit full hd panel if you can't use it for multimedia. Unless you download 10bit content and view it with players like VLC Player, the 10 bit panel is of no use.\n3) Bluetooth range is weak.\n4) Average haptic feedback.\n5) Unlocking via fingerprint sensor feels slow. A phone in 2021 with a physical fingerprint sensor should not be this slow. Weird animation choice, hope they fix this also in an update.\n6) No gallery app. Google Photos isn't all that great.\n7) Sound output could have been better. It is just average enough that it doesn't get frustrating.\n8)Low Wifi Range: Not enough people are talking about it, but the wifi range is also really bad on this one. My Realme x2 pro has far superior wifi range than this. When I get 100% wifi coverage on my Realme X2 Pro, I barely get 40% on Moto Edge 20 Fusion.\n\nOverall a good phone for the price only if you can ignore the above mentioned cons. (I can't emphasize enough how bad the cameras are). Motorola can fix most of the cons with a software update, and I'm hoping they do.",
            "Well done moto. Everything is as per my expectation.\nDisplay is of very good quality better than Xiaomi, OP, realme etc.\nBattery is a beast giving 9+hrs of SOT and fully charged in 1hr 30min by 30wt charger.\ncarrier aggregation is available.\nStock android no ads.\nBack camera is good daylight as well as low light but Front camera is not at all working like 32mp.\nI am sure moto will give update at the earliest.",

There are many features such as:\n\u25c6 RAM Boost: If you have 6GB model, you get 1.5GB boost (6+1.5=7.5GB) and 2GB boost in 8GB model (8+2=10GB) which is really appreciable!\n\u25c6 Ready For: This feature must be tried for sure... It's damn cool and useful.\n\u25c6 Gestures, style icons are amazing!\n\u25c6 Touch sensor works really well.\n\u25c6 Android 11 ... And system updates are automatic\n\u25c6 Audio effects and some basic gametime settings are good.\n\u25c6 GIF Maker and Screen recorder in built... So no need to install third party apps.\n\u25c6 Focus mode: To pause distracting apps and hide their notifications\n\u25c6 Battery LASTS LONG: Battery is too good! Even after a screen time of 7-10 hours, battery lasts for 3 days! Overcharge protection and optimised charging is there on the phone. (BATTERY=5000mAH)\n\u25c6 Display is great! (Display rate of 90 Hz)\n\u25c6 Split screen and multi app audio works well\n\u25c6 Camera is great! Speakers are loud enough.\n\u25c6 Connections like Wi-fi, internet and Bluetooth are very good\n\u25c6 Cannot uninstall YT Music from phone even if you are not using it.\n\u25c6 Sound with headphones is also good.\n\nEasy to use, quite slim, fits well in pocket, good finishing. Stock Android is the best.\u263a\ufe0f",
            "I think this phone needs better review.\nCamera is decent - you need to explore the camera app and tweak the settings to get the optimal results. The night mode and the front camera processing needs to improve\nBattery backup is awesome - easily lasts a day with day to day tasks\nThe display is the best - if you like to watch videos on your phone then this is the one you should go for\nPerformance - I didn't experience any jitters or lag. Minimal heat during playing PUBG. Overall I have no complaint\nCharging is really fast - 0-100 % within 1 and half hours.\nI think this is an underrated phone which you should go for. You won't regret your decision",
            "Got this in the month of January 2022 and I haven't been disappointed. I thought dividing the review into pros and cons might help people; here goes:\nPros:-\n\n1) Software:\nMy biggest reason to go for this phone over other brands like Xiaomi/Samsung/Realme etc is the software experience. You get Stock Android which is clean, ad-free and has no bloatware. I have used phones with MIUI before and they were terrible. I see many people go for the specs of Xiaomi or other brands...please don't. In day-to-day tasks, more or less all midrange phones perform well. (For example, the difference between something like a SD 720G and 778G is VERY SMALL, unless you run benchmarks or play heavy games.)\n\n2) Display:\nThis is not an AMOLED screen but an OLED one with 90hz, but the difference is hardly noticeable. This is an excellent and a big display, with good viewing angles and colour reproduction. Watching videos/shows/movies is enjoyable on this screen. I have not noticed any lag/stutter during my usage so far. (Thanks to the OS)\n\n3)Battery and Charging:\nThe battery backup on this phone is OUTSTANDING. During my usage (I don't play any games), I got around 8-9 hours of screen-on time using 90hz with 25-30% battery left, the next morning. Even with heavy usage, it should last well over a day. For moderate/light users (like me) the battery lasts almost 1.5 to 2 days.\n\nYou get a 30W charge with the phone and it charges the phone fast enough. (25-30% to 100% in a bit more than an hour.)\n\n4) Performance:\nDay to day tasks are handled by the phone just fine and the RAM management is good. I went for the 6GB variant and I haven't noticed any lags or stutters.\n\n\nCons:\n1) Camera:\nThe cameras of the phone is a hit and miss. It performed well in good lighting conditions but the performance deteriorated in low and artificial lightning. The main and macro camera are fine but the wide-angle one clicks soft pictures that aren't colour accurate. The selfie camera was bad but it got fixed after a recent update. (I would recommend using the Gcam app as it improves the camera by a mile.)\n\n2) Connectivity:\nI didn't think I would say this but this phone has some connectivity issues, with the Bluetooth and Wifi. It takes quite a lot of time to connect to my home Wifi or even any other network for that reason and even then, it shows \"Limited Connection\", unless I restart the phone or change the MAC address properties. The Bluetooth range seems short too, compared to my previous phone (Asus M1 Max Pro). This is probably a software bug which I hope they fix with an OTA update.\n\n3) Google Photos:\nThe default gallery app of the phone is Google Photos (which is fine by me) but many might not use it. The app essentially backs up your photos to a cloud storage (your default Google storage of 15GB) and after you exhaust your first 15GB of storage, you will have to pay for extra storage. It is advisable that you download a third party gallery app to store your pictures and videos on your device.\n\n4) The Google Assistant Button doesn't work half the time and it's a shame that it can't customised. It's an annoyance (but not a deal-breaker either).",
            "I am a big fan of Motorola Mobile phones..My whole family members are using Motorola mobiles Moto G9, G10, E7, Fusion40. Total 5 motorola phones purchased by me within 1 year. And recently i bough this latest model Moto edge 20 fusion. Motorola phones are at no.1 in quality and durability. Special feature of motorola mobiles is Stock android.\nMoto edge 20 fusion is an amazing mobile phone and far better than real me / redmi/one plus. Everything is number 1 except the front camera quality but it is fine enough and i dont have any issue with the camera picture quality.\nBattery back up is amazing as promised by Motorola. UI is very fast. Best mobile phone in the range of 21,999. Its charging power is exceptional , the phone gets 50% charged within half an hour. Expecting new models to be launched very soon.",
            "Gem of a phone. All tick marks covered. Mind-bogling vivid Display, Fantastic SOT (8 to 9 hours) with 10% charge still left, 3.5 mm jack, good loud speakers, stock android, 30W charger, very useful moto gestures. Daylight camera is excellent, night mode was never Motorola's strong point. Use GCam for the same. Fantastic night sight photos with GCam. Very happy to have bought this phone in first sale.",
            "Camera is ok ok, not like 108MP..not able to click telephoto.. video calls in night time will show like ur face is filled with frackels and brown spots\nBattery is good.\nSound is good.\nPhone is handy is also looking good.\nI bought after seeing 108 MP..but it is not justifying 108..\n\nAlso i am using it only for last 3 days..and it's hanging up already..\n\nNow my 5th day..it has completely stopped twice till now..and not able to connect Bluetooth.\n\nI have reduced my star rating from 3 to 1 already",
            "The phone is good. The camera is also good takes more natural images but it still needs improvement especially the front camera I used stock camera then used G-cam there is a lot of difference regarding the picture quality it shows that, this has a potential to capture great images the picture processing needs an update.\n\nThe display is good as well as the battery backup for a moderate to heavy use type of people. The call quality is great too.\n\nI had another problem regarding the wifi range my previous phone had better compared to this one but I would not say that it's too bad it is manageable it is not a vey big issue you can easily go for day to day usage.",
            "Good phone to buy. Free of bloatware. Don't go by YouTube reviews. Phone is fantastic. Camera is just like normal camera. No frills. It does its job right. People who buy selfie camera for beautifying photo please stay away. This camera will show your real face\n\nRear camera is good and takes real pictures. No bloated saturation and color. Overall 8/10 for motorola. Have been MI used for 5 years.",
            "Its one phone that really got me excited after a long time.. A good looking phone with clean android experience and does all the things required right. The UI interface is just like a breath of fresh air as it is clean and simple. The screen is the highlight of the phone.. Its just fantastic. The only issue i faced was the charging cable stopped charging after two days. After verifying with other chargers, I found out that the problem was with just the cable (not the charger or the phone). Flipkart was notified and they were so helpful as they agreed to pay a voucher for replacement of the cable. Very happy with the purchase.",
            "Am writing this review after using it for more than 20 days.\nPros:\n1. Stock android and a clean UI.\n2. Processor is good manages daily apps without any lag or any frame drop. But it will let you down when you use it for extensive gaming.\n3. Battery is very good, it will last more than a day for normal use with active internet data.\n4. Camera quality is decent\nCons:\n1. Build quality is not up to the mark, it is a more like a plastic back body. Without cover you find it very slippery and finger prints is all over the back.\n2. One of the major issues is about connectivity, don't know whether it is a hardware or software problem. From recent days am facing this issue. Am using jio, on many occasions it will go out of service after refreshing the connection it will show.\n3. Camera is very much average as it will enhance the natural color which will looks odd. And night photos are below average.\n\nOverall, this is a good option for those who will use it for normal usages and want a clean android with decent performance.",
            "I was quite excited since the launch of this phone. My excitement turned to disappointment as soon as I started using the phone.\n\nCamera is sub par and disappointing. Shouldn't have trusted YouTube initial review and impression.\nBattery back up is satisfactory. Should get 2 days backup with average usage with 8 hours SOT.\nDisplay is good and does not live up to the 10 bit OLED panel hype.\nSpeaker quality is decent, does not get loud and clear.\nWifi range is not as good as a Samsung or xiaomi midrange smartphone\nEarpiece quality is good.\n\nOverall, will not hold on to this phone for long to test the 13 5G band support.",
            "When camera and simple features like widgets to lick screen, double tap, no memory recall in calculator, camera application the worst, display great but color saturation and colour is not nice, not appealing, more like alcd display saturation, options to change the display color available but no use",
            "To be honest I was very much worried and in a confusion, if I should go for this mobile or not but I finally went for it and I don't regret now. Anyone who is looking for a good performance based mobile with good display, processor and battery, then this for you. Also 13 5G brands makes it future ready. Listed below are pros and cons\n\nPros\n\nWonderful 10 bit Display with Max 90hz refreshrate\nBattery backup\nStock android\nSpeed\nNo heating issues whatsoever\nGood and very useful customisations\n13 ...\nREAD MORE",
            "The phone is okay. The camera is Not up to the mark as promised in marketing.\nI have used Moto G5 Plus phone which had a feature of screen Lock/Unlock both using Fingerprint Sensor. This feature is missing in Moto Edge 20 Fusion. I personally like that feature. Moto should have kept that feature.\nThe battery backup is good. Performance is decent. Plastic body even around the camera which was not expected. Overall Good Phone, not the best.",
            "Got the phone today. Great phone per se. Only issue is that camera needs some software fix.\nCons: 1. Exceptional performance.\n2. Great display, amoled is worth every buck.\n3. Tried few games, no lag whatsoever.\n4. Battery performance is okay for the first day. Need 12days to know about real battery backup.\n5. Stock android is awesome. Zero bloatware zero ad.\n\n\nShall update after few days of usage.",
            "Don't think, just go for it.\n\nAbove is the 1st statement of this review.I am writing this after exploring all the features & performance of this phone and trust me you are not going be disappointed with this phone.\n\nYou will be very satisfied with it's:\n- Screen quality (Watching movies/videos is absolute delight, best in this price range, but you must remember to chnage the settings of Youtube, Netflix to stream in best quality)\n- Sound from its Mono Speaker (Although it has a mono speaker but it is much better than Mi, Realme stereo speakers and in headphones its 3d surround sound effect is just awesome)\n- Battery life (Undoubtedly one of the best you can get, easily lasts for 1.5 Days)\n- Performance (It's simply a beast, you throw anything at it and it will handle with ease)\n- Future Ready (It supports highest no of 5G bands in India, more than its big brother Moto edge 20 Pro)\n\nI understand many people have complaints about its camera performance, but if you use its settings optimally then you can get good images, many people have posted great photos with this phone and some have posted poor ones as well. I am satisfied with its camera and read the reviews its higher end brother, Moto edge 20 pro, it has similar hardware and people are very happy with its camera, so its just a matter of one OTA update and your complaints about camera will be gone. Don't mistake me, I am still getting excellent performance with its camera, but I have spent some time on camera settings.\n\nAlso, after buying this phone, explore all its settings. It has some really cool features.\n\nThose who don't like gesture minimize apps, they can go to settings type \"gestures\" and in its Navigation setting, change the navigation to \"3 button navigation\" to get old traditional back home & multitasking buttons.\n\nIn short. This is the best phone at 20k and I will buy this anyday over brands like Mi, RealMe etc.",
            "This phone is really awesome...camera is too good display is awesoms...voice quality is perfect...refreshing rate is perfect ...its very smooth phone ...i love this product\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude19...Truely happy",
            "Overall Good Phone\nCamera can be improved with a simple update.. Till the time best fix is to use GCam.. Best alternative\nDisplay is crispy and perfect..\nSound is also great..\n13 5G bands gives best Net experience and HD voice call.\nPerformance is good for simple use.",
            "I would have liked to give this device a 3.5 rating but 3 it is .\nFirst the issues that vex me :\nNot having always on display\nNo gorilla glass front or back\nBattery sometimes does funny stuff one night I left the phone at 33% charge and in the morning it was 19% with battery saver on !!\n\nPros :\nDisplay is good, really good\nCharging 30 watts can get your battery from 10% to 90 in some 60 mins .\nFor a normal to heavy use with 6-7 hrs of screen on time it's good for that .\nStock android is a major plus if you are into that .",
            "PROs - Display, Battery & Stock Experience.\nCONs - The Camera ! Though sometimes it works decent ( especially with GCam installed- I have attached a picture taken with the camera) , most of the time it\u2019s simply under performing.\nExcept for camera, the phone is Good \u2665\ufe0f",
            "All rounder. too much written on its Camera part, but its good one.\nbig screen but light weight & battery also charged fast & stand for whole day for heavy uses on Bluetooth & call . hope it will continue\nOnly thing i found its Finger lock should be on front are back as on side there is limitation\noverall its good phone . just go for it.",
            "It's been 2 months now I am using Moto edge 20 Fusion 5G. I am completely satisfied with the phone. Battery wise it goes up to 2 days once completely charged. I am not a gaming guy hence not sure about the battery life if you play games throughout the day. Coming to Camera, I am satisfied but definitely the camera algorithm need some more improvement. As for as applications are concerned, I really never faced any hiccups and the operation remains buttery smooth. The stock android experience is great. No ads no bloatwares. Overall it's a value for money purchase.",
            "Never had used any high refresh rate phone, and coming from samsung which pushes bloatware through updates, the stock android feels so smooth, the 90hz is just butter.\n\nI absolutely recommend this phone to everyone, I never faced a single issue since I started using the phone, no wifi-drop nothing.\n\nAlso, I barely open my camera, so I don't know anything about it, and have no opinion on it. It would be great if get rid of front camera altogether \ud83d\ude01",
            "There are many review for this phone on YouTube. Many youtuber shown that camera is good but it is not true after using this phone for 3-4 days I have writing my views..\n1. Camera quality is very poor even my Mi A1 had better photo quality.\n2. Battery backup is good.\n3. Phone is handy.\n4. Display is also good",
            "Stock Android, more than superb display, good battery, and great processor. I am just stocked to have no ads or bloatware in my phone lol. My third phone and my third Motorola phone so that should tell you how much I love it.",
            "Writing review after 4 days of extensive use ...\n1. Display is awesome.. vibrant colours smooth touch and refresh rate is best ...deserve 5 stars.\n2. Performance is good\n3. camera is average ... expected to be updated in upcoming software updates\n4. Battery lasts two days with average use and with intensive use can can last a day ... So 5 stars for battery\n5. Overall best phn with 5g connectivity. And 4.5 \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f",
            "Well phone is good I bought it 21k camera is good in good light otherwise a normal camera.\nThe WIFI and network issue I faced where another mobile works 5 % it works 2% like network in basement the quality of network to be improved.",
            "With comparison of moto g5s plus.This review is after one day usage (will update if any problem comes)\n\n*Build quality : Not great but it's ok specifically camera module (not lens) don't have glass\n*Camera : Excellent\n*Performance : Excellent\n*Network reception : Excellent\n*Battery backup : Excellent\n\nThings that I don't like..\n1: Too much long, please make a 6 inch or below compact mobile.\n2: Power and volume button should be slightly on lower side\n3: Missing long press fingerprint sensor phone lock option\n\nOverall it's a good mobile with two year software update guarantee (hope we will get that\ud83d\ude04)",
            "I love moto so much because of its performance , clean Android experience, splash proof and built quality .I have been using moto turbo power,moto one power and now moto edge 20 fusion .I m in love with the performance and looks ..value for money",
            "Bought it in the First sales and have been using for quite some while\nPros:\n1. Display - great display\n2. Battery - getting good battery as i keep using the device\n3. Selfie Camera - really good specially in outdoor conditions\n4. Performance - overall great performance except my phone restarted twice for no reason\n\nCons:\n1. Rear Camera - Not even close to OnePlus and Redmi, when i zoom, the photos are pixelated and it is not equal to 108 MP\n2. Speaker - Not so loud speaker\n3. Connectivity - Includes WIFI, Bluetooth (for Bluetooth headset).\n\nOverall Good Phone with Sleek design. I haven't used other phones in the same range so am not sure if this phone worth the money.\nAll cons can be rectified with software updates, lets hope Moto does it.",
            "Very good phone with all the features in this price segment. Camera is better than expected. Display is smooth. Battery backup is very good. Previously I've been using pixel 2 so stock UI and no bloatware and moto delivering the same. Very happy with purchase, delivery and overall experience with the phone.",
            "Best phone under this price clean ui no bloatware that's a big plus nowdays all the smartphone are good performs well according to processor we have to make a choice on which UI we are going to use .This ui is good to use with limited customisation.",
            "Some problems I have faced like heating while vedio calls, battery draining is fast, and few more.. excepting that they could clear in next update.. liked 4g speeds as CA is given and screen size & display\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70...waiting for Android 12 update.. bought this mobile with so much doubtfully.. but it satisfying me as I am not a heavy gamer.. day to day tasks were going smoothly...",
            "Very good specifications for the price.\nThe display is fantastic. 6 GB varient is more than sufficient for routine tasks.\nCamera and battery performance seems satisfactory.\nClean stock Android experience with 2 major promised updates does the job perfectly.\n'Cyber teal' looks great in reality, completely different from the images shown here",
            "As I have used this phone for more than 10 days\nPros\n1.Stock Android experience no adds,bloatware\n2.Big battery with dimensity 800u(6nm) and can be used upto two days without gaming activites\n3.Display is good with all rounder features\n4.Good specs of connectivity like Carrier aggregation and 13 5g bands\n5.Promised 2 years of software and security update and Android 12 will be upgraded to soon confirmed by Motorola\n\nCons\n1.Display is too large as I can't access the phone with one hand\n2.This phone is not a camera centric phone however the camera is improving day by day with updates but still I have seen better camera output in lesser than 15k phones. The hardware is good but needs software optimisation at this point of time\n3.as the phone supports fast charger the phone gets little warm not heat still it may degrade the battery capacity\n\n\nIf you don't consider camera as priority then this phone is definitely for you go for it",
            "It's really a great phone. The best in class display. I am really loving the display. Secondly, the stock android is another reason which makes this a very good phone. The battery backup is around a day. Camera needs more improvement but after the update it has been better. So overall a good phone. You can go for it anytime....\nOk missed one thing the network is also very good in this phone. The quality of internet is better with 4G+ and as on papers 13 5G bands make this future proof .",
            "I had never made a wrong choice for my mobile phones. I think I have made one now. There are actually no major problems to be honest. Just that its camera is bad enough to irritate you after paying so much for the phone. I wanted to buy samsung F62 but the heating issues and better specs of Edge20 fusion made me go for the latter. I knew there is a compromise on camera but never expected it to me such a huge compromise. The clean android experience is said to be the usp of this device but I was using Mi A3 which also had pure android with far far better camera. The went with the reviews that had mentioned that its camera is not great but it's good enough in day light conditions. That's is partly true. Rear camera is just OK. Not worths the price of the phone. About selfies I can say that you simply forget that there is a front camera in this phone and you will be good. It's that bad. Actually. There are absolutely no details in the selfie. I don't know how can it be 32MP camera. I tried scam as well but selfies don't imrove much. Anyways, if camera is not your priority and you love pure android, you can buy this phone. Otherwise there is nothing much to recommend it for really.",
            "Writing a review after 4 days of use.\n(previously been using moto g3 ever since it was released hence moto edge 20 fusion is a big upgrade for me)\nPerformance : It's a very silky smooth experience\nOS: as usual moto has a clean interface with stock android.\nCamera: Its pretty decent and amazing overall, low-light images could have been a bit better but nevertheless it's good. As for the selfie camera I was a bit disappointed when the images were flipped and saved but then found out you can opt for mirror image in the settings. Loved the five finger gesture for selfie cam.\nBattery : I found it impressive as it lasted 1 day and 6 hours untill the next battery charge with about 8 hours of onscreen time.\nI'm honestly satisfied and happy with this purchase",
            "Only one thing to improve which is camera is very bad and mediatek dimensity 800u chipset does not support 108mp camera sensor it is only support upto 64mp sensor and camera is very very bad there much more color shifting it looks artificial and beauty mode is off\nOtherwise all good like battery , performance ( i am not gamer so i don't know what's the performance regarding gaming) display is very good and 90hz refresh rate with stock android phone what a combination love it\nSo hope that camera issue will fix by moto as soon as possible\nAnd even if they fix that issue i don't think so there much difference because of its chipset so if you do more photography don't purchase it i repeat don't even if they fix it\nSo i hope my review will help you to buy this phone\nAnd don't trust on YouTube that much ....",
            "Many people complain about the camera. Let me help you to get the best shots i have good results. Go to camera settings and select recommend settings not high resolution and select the aspect ratio to full and turn off the HDR. Now the photo seems good. Hope this will be helpful. I have attached the sample shot for your reference\n\nDisplay seems good but colour are sometimes over saturated\n\nBattery is good no issue with the backup",
            "Above all the pictures quality is worst,just for namesake only 108mp camera, dynamic range is nill, autofocus is useless...redmi note 10 camera is far better than this, Motorola should work on quality rather than humongous specs of camera MP...grow up...there are far better camera phone in this price segment..I feel shy to use my phone camera in presence of other redmi phone, samsung mobile etc",
            "People who are looking for clean close to Android UI experience. This is the perfectly balance phone. AMOLED Display, Price, UI, Storage and 2 years of Android updates are key highlights of this phone. Rear camera is satisfied but front camera is disappointing for selfie lovers. If Motorola will improve it's camera processing through updates then it will be unbeatable phone in this price range. Check out the pictures.",
            "Best mobile phone in this price range. Crispy and Cristal clear display with amazing colors, contrast and brightness. Smooth and flow like touch movement. Very good touch sensitivity. When looking into the camera department, it will done all best. Ultra clear shots. Very good pictures. Amazing camera performance even in low light. No shutter delay. I liked it's performance very much. Weightless and compact design. An amazing thing in your hand. Battery last one and half day with moderate use. Fast charging is impressive. Speed and performance is enough for me. Iam not a gamer. My attractions are below :\n1. Crisp and Sharp colourful display\n2. Ultra smooth finger touch\n3. Super camera performance even in low light\n4. Sharp and Cristal clear photos\n5. Good battery performance\n6. Clear audio\n7. Call quality is excellent\n8. Signal reception is also good\n9. WiFi calling and 4g performance is best\n10. Light weight and hand compact\n11. Pure Android is Super and one of the main attraction.\n\nThe decision is yours to buy or not buy.

Gaming 4/5\nOverall it's a decent product but the camera need to improve a lot , Eve though it provides a lot of camera features but picture quality is not up to the mark, can be improved with software updation. Battery and processor good enough for normal usesrs.",
            "As a Stock android performance is good. I have been using it for a month. One of the worst aspect of this phone is it's camera. Even after having 108 MP it's image seems like pixelated during noon hours and video quality is also distorted. There is no stability in them. Otherwise other features like screen , finger sensor are good. Overall if you have no priority for camera then you can go for it.",
            "Great phone for students, great picture quality, great sound its completely worth 21499/- not regretting at all.",

            "perfect phone...\nEverything as promised ,\nSmooth experience , camera is very nice .\nI find no issues .\ntill now no problems",
            "Much better overall than expected. Cyber Teal color is actually mostly light Green in hand and really looks classy. Of course, plastic back but reflects light in different hues! And it has a notification LED light - I only wish this was integrated with the OS so that it'd show notifications :-) The performance is silky smooth and the OLED display is A++. Stockish Android is easy on the resources and battery life is outstanding. I don't depend much on smartphone camera for important personal events, so don't have a stand on this matter. However, appreciate the 8MP rare ultra-wide camera also as a macro camera. Expandable storage is fast getting extinct and glad this one has it! Fairly light (under 190 grams) and reasonably easy to handle as a daily driver. Bought it for 19.5K after a 1K CC payment discount (thanks Citibank) 6/128 configuration! Thanks FK for the 1-day delivery. Am happy with this purchase for sure and would easily recommend it to all with similar priorities!",
            "Camera quality is average , display are excellent, battery is good . I expected motorola can update camera quality in future much better than current situation . gaming performance is good . Front camera and back camera are not perfectly clear image while taking pictures in zooming .",

            "The phone is super smooth thanks to its processor and stock android.\nMy highest priorities were stock android, fast processor and excellent display. Those who are looking for all rounder mobile in 20k, this is best one. Also camera is good , I don't find any particular issue which camera. I don't know why people are having issues with it, may be they have watched YouTube and gave similar reviews. GO FOR IT . THIS IS BEST ONE YOU CAN FIND . And also 5G bands and Stock android makes this phone future proof.",
            "Best Display\nAmoled with 90 hz refresh rate\nNice Camera\nThe dynamic range of the sensor is good\nSelfie camera is not that great we get noise in photo in artifial lighting condition.\nBest Mid range processor\nOverall best phone for multimedia and a future proof phone with 13 5g bands.\nMoto pc connect is a very good feature.\nGaming experience is above average\n- we get smooth+ ultra settings in BGMI.\nThe only problem is that it is difficult to get screen card and case. For the phone with exact size.\nDimensity processors need to be optimised as they have underated settings in gaming.As they have more potential.\nSpecially in Cod graphic settings is set to low.\nIt is a issue with dimensity processors -800U ,810.\nI am also a user user of realme 8s 5g which comes with dimensity 810.\nThe Touch responce is not that great as TSR is not mentioned qny where.\nThe software experience is good. Near to stock Android.\nBattery backup is not that great I have to charge twice a day.\nIt took around 1 hour to charge 0 to 100.",
            "I really enjoyed\nDisplay\nSound\nPerformance Day to day used very well\nI am not heavy user for games but i play well COC and Call of duty\nStock Android is best part\n\nNeed to more work in camera.\nCamera is okay okay.\nI am not photographer but i really don't like front facing camera on this mobile.\n\nIf you are stock Android fan and you want to security in Mobile so it's really worth i really like it..",
            "This phone is very underwhelming. Specially the battery drains out really quick. Custom roms have much better battery optimisation. Motorola did not do much about the software either. They could optimise the battery and the camera much better than what's the case right now. I would love that way better than an android update.",
            "Pro - 1.amazing screen 2. Great chip(never lags) 3. Good enough battery 5. Clean UI 6. Handy desin (comfortable while holding)\nCons 1. Camera could have been better( especially night time camera)",
            "This smart phone comprises of great features especially connecting with PC which gives you a new experience at all. Night vision camera mode gives you a good clicks with clearity of pics. Battery performance is good. Value added experience.",
            "At this price point, one can expect a better front camera. The front camera was taking hazy pictures. Back camera is okay and is not that bad. Very easy UI experience. Stable performance. The phone comes with a back cover but it\u2019s not good for protection.",
            "Great product by Motorola.\nI don't think this 108mp camera is great. I didn't get any speciality at this 108mp range. But macro and spot colour options is really good.\nAwesome display.\nFront camera is average.\nDue to stock android features like app lock and another widgets are not available.\n.but I loved it",
            "Absolutely loved it\nCAMERA - 3.5/5 considering the price point this smartphone gives a decent camera experience, although there were some camera optimization issues which were fixed after an update.\n\nBATTERY - 4/5 can easily last for about a day with an heavy usage and takes about 1hr15 to 1hr20 mins to charge from 0 to 100%. Main thing is tht this phone don't heat much it can also be said there is no heating issues, yes while charging for the first time it can get a little warm but thts normal.\n\nSOFTWARE - 5/5 if u are a person who likes the stock android like experience then this is a must buy. No adds no bloatware, it just feels so smooth.\n\nDISPLAY - 5/5 this is the usp of this device. Mere words words wont do much justice to the experience u get with the dislay on this phone. Its just awesome.\n\nOVERALL VERDICT - 4.5/5 Trust me there's very less options in the market which provides a perfect package with decent cameras, good UI, excellent display. Its definitely better than some of the so called no.1 and best indian smartphones by the chinese smartphone army.",
            "Seems like a Good Product\u2026 In first look.\n5* to Flipkart for Decent delivery time but very Competitive price.\n\nWill give my complete Review after 3 month of usage.\n\nSince i am having high expectations this time too and my benchmark will remain same.\nOn which all my previous devices Moto G5, HtC one and Iphone 4, 5s, 6S+\u2026 all performed very well",
            "I have used this phone for about 5-4 months and everything about it is good except the camera. The quality is not as good as expected. But everything else is good especially the display. So if you want a excellent display and good battery, performance and kinda good camera phone this is perfect for you.",
            "Pros - Hdr 10 bit oled display\nUfs storage 2.2\nBack camera great in daylight\nFront camera great when used with live filter option, but still need polishing.\nNightsight works great\nDecent loudspeaker not bad at all.\nFingerprint works fast and accurate.\n\nCons- whole ui needs update as there are bugs like notification toast doesnt go away for15 seconds.sometimes power touch doesn't work well.\nActive noise cancellation needs more work as background noise badly creeps in voice notes in short the mic is too strong with no optimisation.\n\nEverything else is fine..this phone truly can be killer if the next update clears all faults.",
            "Using for more that month and overall please with the performance of the phone.\n\n1. Minimal bloatware - user can uninstalled or disabled\n2. Clean stock ROM\n3. Most of all G-Apps preinstalled\n4. 6.7 Large screen with OLED display. Not every phone in this range is having OLED\n5. 5000 mAh battery stays for more than 3 days\n6. Amazed with 30W turbo charge 50% in 10-15 mins\n7. Front and rear both camera quality is good for day to day photography (not expert on this)\n8. Speaker sound is ok but Dolby could be advantage\n9. Side mounted finger print sensor super fast\n10. NFC - Not all OEMs are giving NFC in price range/segment\n11. dedicated G Assistance hard button - Today first time I tried and worked well!\n12. Refresh rate 90 Hz is as per standard but 120 Hz could be advantage\n13. Splash and dust proof. Looks like petty things no one notice this but it is value add to customer\n14. Finally It's 5G\n\nBest part - MADE IN INDIA\n\nNot a Gamer so cannot comment on game performance\n\nLast Flipkart gave me better exchange rate on my 4 year old phone!!! Thanks Flipkart!!!",

            "All good , may be moto cam don't give good or expected result but if you use gcam .. u can surely get desired pic quality ..... And it gives u what you see ... So if u like original photos without filter or modification ... U will love it otherwise u get disappointed",
            "It is a great phone even though some updates could make it better.. overall it's a good choice to buy it\npros - superb display, fast 90hz refresh rate, battery life is excellent and Motorola customizations for easy use\ncons- camera is not good but can be managed with gcam and there is no album in this, so u need to use google photos\nAfter all, I am satisfied with this product",
            "Been using this phone for more than 15 days now and I have to say that Motorola has impressed after a damn long time. This phone marks not all the checks but the necessary ones.\n\nDisplay- an outstanding oled display. Don't get into the number parts that it is 10bit or anything. Display is good and only that matters.\nPerformance -Balanced performance without any hiccups or stutters. Just a couple bugs here and there.\nCamera- Could have been better but nonetheless it is not useless or anything like that.\nSoftware- Biggest strength of this phone. It is so clean and fluid. No bloat and no ads. Sadly this is the only company to offer this.\nFuture ready- whenever 5g comes in india this phone will make sure to take advantage making it future proof for atleast next 3 years.\nBattery- Lasts for more than 1.5 days and that's a big win. Charging is also perfect at a sweet spot of 30w, not too fast not too slow.\nSo this phone is perfect competition to other midrangers. Recommended for most people who have the budget. Will update the review after a couple months.",

            "It's a very intricate decision for me to prefer this over OnePlus Nord CE. I'm proud of my choice now. The primary camera is a highlight for this smartphone. I attach certain photographs here for the reference. It is to note that the photography on this mobile requires users to make certain adjustments in the settings for clearer images. Battery is like a life saver, it lasts around 1-1.5 days.",

Generally people are saying camera is bad but truth is they don't know how use Motorola edge 20 fusion phone camera.... They clicking pictures at 8mp settings which is default settings for camera (not 108mp) and Motorola edge 20 fusion phone have good camera features and settings, so use it for maximum optimisation and adjust with surroundings/background and object.",

I found it adequate.

I purchased it for 5g+ amoled display+108 mp camera but the camera performance is worse in its category.. display is good and only god knows about 5g support/performance.\n\nSelfie camera is not having tap to focus feature which is annoying when it is not automatically focusing on the subject. (Atleast I didn't find tap to focus feature in selfie cam)\n\nAlso, even though the beauty mode is off (front camera) it is taking pictures with very smooth blemish kind of effect. So if you want a camera phone don't even think of it.\n\nMain camera the 108mp is also capturing photos in very warm tone and mostly over saturates the colors...\n\nIf they fix these camera issue with software updates then it may become a considerable phone otherwise it's just waste of money..",

The most common problem that people have had, the Bluetooth and WiFi.\nBluetooth - I didn't have any problem with my device, I'm using my Bluetooth earphones the same way as with my previous phone (Samsung). So the range hasn't been an issue.\nWiFi - Definitely noticed the difference. Not in speed, but in how strongly was the WiFi signal being read. It is better other phones. But not noticed a big difference with speed.\n\n2. Camera - It is definitely a lil below average. But download gcam mod and you'll be good.\n\n3. Display - very very good. You can notice the difference a 10 bit display makes.\n\n4. Sound - no problem\n\n5. Battery - no problem\n\n6. Feature rich - yes definitely",

I'm posting review after one month usage. Most of the negative reviews here bcz of poor quality camera. Other than camera this is best phone for daily use.

My experience so far is really good with this phone except for camera of thia phone.\n\nLet's talk about pros and cons in little detail.\n\nPros -\n1. Great display really good for content consumption I bought this device over realme gt me only because of software and display. Really satisfied with the display of the phone.\n\n2. Great software no bloatware no ads with some moto gestures. There are minor customisation options to mould your moto to your own taste.\n\n3. Processor is really good I have experienced no lag what so ever in my phone till this day. I play CODM Ranked MP/BR no lags till this day.\n\n4. I'm getting +9hrs SOT on casual day to day usage and 7-8hrs if hard core gaming. If you are a casual user you'll be need to charge in like 2 days. Weight distribution is really good.\n\nCons - cons may differ person to person this is my experience with my 1st moto device.\n\n1. Worst camera performance. If you want a camera phone please don't consider this phone.\n\n2. No gallery app no data speed indiactor. They should have provide gallery for this phone.\n\n3. No good quality backcover available for this phone.\n\nConclusion - great product for content consumption all things are really good just camera is not upto the mark. You can play casual games without any problems",

More than 2 days if not streaming videos & around 1.5 day with video calls, watching movies online & streaming music.\nComing to camera,\nRear camera performance is good not great. It is at par with other popular mid range phones. (I have personally compared with MI, samsung M32 & Nord CE 5G.) Photo quality are very similar with all the phones mentioned above. However like many reviews mention it does feel like 108mp camera. Satisfied with day light performance. For low light performance oneplus nord ce was better.\nFront camera performance is satisfying enough. I don't recommend this phone for selfie lovers.\nIn short, photos are natural & not beautified like some popular chinese phones.\nMy overall experience has been satisfying.",

            "We all know about the technical specs so don't wanna waste time to discuss the same. Let's get straight to the Pros and Cons.\n\nCONS:\n\n1. Camera is good only on paper. In reality it does not perform as 108MP. Pretty average cameras. GCam can sort out the issue though.\n2. Bluetooth range is poor compared to other brands at even of lower prices. Audio quality via Bluetooth is also average.\n3. Wifi range is also a bit low but does the job. Not a con for casual users.\n4. Notification light is there but not optimized to work. Sometime it works at switch off condition. Pretty weird.\n5. Peek Display is a great option to have but very irritating at the same time. Even if the table shakes a bit the display turns on. Instead double tap to wake or lock would have been much better.\n6. No Always on Display.\n\nPROS:\n\n1. Call quality via earpiece is very good along with network reception and Wifi calling.\n2. Display is also great but not as good as flagship devices. Pretty good at the price point.\n3. Battery is too good. Gives easily for one and a half day with moderate usage (without gaming). Charging speed is okay, took approx 75 to 80 mins to charge from 10% to 100%.\n4. UI is very good, no bugs, no bloatware, no ads. Its a charm to use such smooth UI. No more headache with software updates like others are pushing tons of bugs with updates.\n5. Despite having a 6.67 inch display and 5000mAh battery, the phone is very light and comfortable to use. Only 185 grams. But not for single handed use.\n6. 3.5mm jack is a blessing to have coz my Sennheiser, Sony and JBL headsets are far superior than the budget TWS.\n7. Last but not the least, Finger print sensor is very responsive. Works 100% time.\n\nI am not a gamer so cannot comment on gaming part. It is basically an all rounder phone for those who are mainly need a phone for day to day use. Nothing either extra ordinary nor a bad performer. Motorola is back with a bang but needs to improve more.\n\nHit a like if you found my review helpful.",

This was the only mid-range one with some sort of dust and water protection, an OLED screen, and stock android, the potential 5G is a bonus if it comes to India before the usable lifetime of this device. The camera is good enough and charging speed is brilliant. I peg it's a decent phone for a 2-3 year window at least, the previous one I had was the E5 Plus, and that was a chunky monster, and that lasted 3 years. Not expecting stellar performance in a mid range but compared to my S20+ side by side, the screen is the same size and as good, the speaker performance loud enough, the usual apps load as fast, it's only noticeable in the camera dept that this is a mid range and that's fine.",
