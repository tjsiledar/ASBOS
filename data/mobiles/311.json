            "Worth purchasing\nThis phone has a ridiculously loud stereo speaker and sound volume is also better than many smartphones. The phone rattles in the vibration, so good vibration motor. The battery is huge for a feature phone. It takes some time getting used to its UI and figuring out all the functions but its worth it. The camera is VGA and pictures are pretty much useless. The signal reception for wireless radio is weaker than wired FM. The sound output through earphones is fantastic. Bluetooth works properly. The music player has an Equaliser!(in its settings); It has 3 inbuilt games. You have to use a SD card to store anything. King talker is available which only speaks out numbers when dialing and receiving a call and tells time every hour. The torch is very bright. The phone has 2000 contacts memory and 250 sms memory. The package comes with a charger and a basic earphone.",
