            "Fabulous! Amazing! Mind Blowing!! Are few expression to describe this phone. I gifted this phone to my wife and she is loving it every minute.\n\nDesign: Flawless and top notch design by Oppo for the this Phone. The phone size, curved screen and camera setup competes the best flagship phones like Samsung and Apple in the market.\n\nDisplay: Full HD Display gives crystal clear images. The screen refresh rate is so high, enjoying the fast scrolling and switching between apps.\n\nCamera: My wife was a Samsung S series user and she did not had high expectations with any phone except Apple, but this Camera is outstanding. Every click comes out like a professional photograph which can easily put best DSLR cameras to shame. I'll attach few pictures to speak by itself. The selfie camera glows the phone screen to bring out bright photos even in the darkeat place.\n\nBattery: It has a decent battery backup, and the charging is super fast. It charges the entire phone in 30 minutes flat.\n\nWe'll add more points after using it for few more days. For now, best phone ever. Simply go for it.\n\n10/10 : Full points to the makers.",

It was around 60% I put it on charge and started doing some other work, I come back after 15 mins it was fully charged . I was amazed !! Coming from charging speeds of 18 watts this is extraordinary. Performance wise no lag so far and no jitters while using multiple apps afterall it's the mediatek dimensity 1000+ inside . The best part about the phone is the curved amoled display its just gets you into an immersive experience while viewing content. Will update my review after few months of usage.

Plz bring back the oppo dialer and its default call recording feature(as other reno phones have it). Google's dialer and call recording has an annoying sound that plays before starting to record and Indians need and love this feature in the simplest way possible.",
            "I am using this device for few days and am totally impressed. I bought the Black version which is absolutely stunning look and feels very premium in hand. I found all together Performance is superb. Color OS 11 is great. I read few negetive comments from few customers. Not sure what's the expectations. I can say Battery performance is also not too bad at all. Further it get charged from 40%-100% less than 20 minutes. Sound is too clear and pretty loud. Only few thing I dislike.\n\n1.The USB to 3.5 adaptor should be there in the box. 2. Provided ear phones is good but old iphone type which I didn't like.\n3.Stereo speaker is missing although Sound clarity is great.\n\n\nLook : 5/5\nDisplay : 5/5\nCamera : 5/5\nSound : 4/5\nFeelings in hand : 5/5\nBattery Charging : 5/5\nBattery performance : 4/5\nGraphic Performance : 5/5",

It charge my phone fro 0 to100 in less than 30 mins.\nThe sound of the phone is Dolbey fantabulous.\nDisplay is very soothing and as per my expectations.\nNo issues at all with RAM or processing speed.\nCamara is also very good. Since i am not a good photographer, i am not able to perform its actual strength test.\n\nOverall i can say its one of the best in the market.",

It's butter smooth.\n\nJus charge for 10 mins and pack the charger and forget it for the whole day. Such a dashing charging speed.\n\nVery less weight. Big display and curved display will give a very premium look. Mattee finish at the rear looks posh. I love Astral blue. Yet to check cam features. But I am fully satisfied.\n\nEdit:\nCamera is not upto mark for this price range.\nAs promised credited 5000 Supercoins for this purchase (intro offer).\nBattery draining bit fast.\nHate the default photo gallery.\n\nStill happy with the phone due to intro offers. Ofcourse it gives a premium look on hand.",

Amoled display does its job perfectly and the AI camera never fails to amaze even once. Battery life is decent. Superfast charging ensures the battery is juiced up in less than one hour. Best phone in this range and latest, 5G technology.\nThe delivery boy who came for delivery from flipkart wanted to extract some extra cash by pulling non-existent flaws in the body of exchange handset but was sorted by calling up his seniors. Flipkart needs to work with its delivery partners to ensure its loyal customers are saved from such harassments and cheats.",
            "Good phone .. and display is good ...only price is more ... If it would cost between 25 to 30k then it is good ...",
            "Early review\nI was one of the first customers who pre ordered this phone. Thanks Flipkart for one day early delivery. This is my take on one day of use. Will update later.\n\n1.first thing u will notice is the lightness of the phone\n2.charging is super fast. But I have noticed moderate heating of screen and back while charging\n3.few preinsallted apps are there. We can remove most. But Netflix is not removable\n4.screen is good. 120Hz would have been better for this prize.\n5.fingerprint sensor underdisplay is fairly accurate. But it takes slightly longer time.\n6.screen protection film is pre applied.\n7.they have also included a transparent back cover\n\nUpdate 1: Battery life is average. Drains little faster. But can easily last a day with moderate use.\n2. There is no option to select default home screen. Also no widgets of wifi, Bluetooth,etc for easy access (only can be accessed in notification drawer). Wonder y such basic and simple features are omitted.",
            "This is a honest review after using the phone for over 2 weeks :\nI bought this phone on a pre-order basis that included HDFC bank discount of Rs.3,500 and exchange value for my Asus Zenfone 5Z for 5,750 (although I later chose to keep my Asus phone because it was too good to part and paid the exchange value in cash). Alsp as part of the Pre order I got Complete Mobile protection at Re.1 and exchange the phone with 3-12 months for ~ Rs.26,000 at Re1 and finally 5,000 Flipkart Super coins . All this made the deal really very attractive.\n\nNow coming to the mobile review:\nPros:\n1. Mobile is sleek and light weight (just 173g) and that way it is the best in this range\n2. Look and feel is great especially the curved edges. Screen display is good\n3. Best charging capability. So far it has been able to charge the mobile from sub 10% to 100% in less than 30 minutes. This is just awesome.\n4. Dimensity 1000+ processor is good. For a normal mobile users this is more than sufficient\n5. Photo camera is average while the Video camera is really good\n6. Mobile volume is average\n7. Signal reception is good\n8. UI is good but I preferred to have POCO launcher to enhance the usability\n\nCons:\n1. Fingerprint Reader - This sensor is slow in response even when the screen is On. When the screen is Off it stutters further. I think this can be fixed via a software update to some extent\n2. Battery life seems to have an issue; I'm not a gamer and don't play any games. I use the phone only for news, media content and a bit of camera. I consider myself an average user. That way i expect the phone to live up to 1.5 days but it barely reaches a day's mark and kind of dies down even if the usage extends a little bit\n3. Quad camera is ok , but they must have provided a telephoto camera at this cost. Photo camera quality is average\n4. Call recording - Most people are saying they don't see call recording in the app . Not sure why but this is available for sure. But the big let down is when recording a call you hear a recorded message saying that the call is being recorded that is audible to both the parties. Looks like this is a compliance feature in some countries but definitely not in India. As none of the other phones have this compliance. This is a big let down. Don't think even any third party app can fix this as i have tried out a few but none addresses this. Please Oppo remove this audio message.\n5. Contacts and Dialer UI Integration is not good, please rework this UI for a better usability\n6. Community - Oppo Community Support looks non-existent. There are so many posts without a response. My post in Oppo Community on 29th is yet to be responded. Even their LOV for devices does not list Oppo Reno 5 PRO 5G, It has only up to Oppo Reno 4. I have seen Xiaomi and Realme responding to queries in their community support well within a day even with a large volume of posts.\n7. Lag - Minor UI lag is there when you have 3-4 apps running and forget Snapdragon 865 you cannot even compare this to Snapdragon 855.\n8. Price - Considering the device at its current list price of Rs.36,000, it definitely is much costlier",
            "All the offers during sale make the purchase as best budget phone. Like the camera, display, video quality, looks, supervooc fast charging truely make the phone best in this segment. \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\ude0a",

            "Good camera l great battery backup l screen quality great l processor speed good . All over good mobile.",
            "I love the Design of the phone, no doubt.\nPerformance wise it's pretty decent, good for an average user who doesnt really play games and is into day to say social media apps.\nCamera- The AI tech. is pretty funky but most of those AI shots in portrait is pretty cringy, I wont lie. Not something I would upload on Social Media.\nThe pictures do well with noise reduction at night, but mostly natural colours are lost.\nIn normal light conditions, pictures have a very high contrast. Again, ruins the natural portrait shots.\nNever use this camera if you have used an iPhone for sure xD\nBattery- I usually keep it on 60Hz, because of the battery drain. It still drains faster than my 3000MaH battery phone. Either Oppo lied about the 4000 MaH battery, or the Mediatech processor is really bad with Battery efficiency.\nOne could say if i charge it for 15 mins, it could last me half a day at least. You are definitely right. But considering my profession when im at my OPD, i dont have the time, also the 65W Charger is pretty bulky. Not really portable I would day. So definitely keep this in mind if you can charge it for like 15 mins in between, sure its not bad.\nDisplay is pretty good. But at this price point you can get an older model of a high end phone with a 4k display. Practically, i barely used 4k, so this doesn't really matter much to me. At least the material is AMOLED so it wont disappoint.\nFinger print- Decent, have seen faster under the display ones.\nOverall, i think this phone is pretty decent. I dont think the camera would be any better than the OnePlus 8T. Maybe somewhat equal in terms of the picture quality.\nDefinitely a must buy if youre into new Tech. If youre into photography amd have used the iphone, then definitely you shouldn't go for this phone.\nPrice point is a fine. Could have been lower in my opinion. At least i got buy back so maybe I'll get another phone in the coming months or next year.",
            "A perfect example of alround performance. Have been using this for over a week now and have been totally loving it. At a time when more and more companies are producing bulky phones and increasing the weight of the devices, this comes as a pleasure. With over 4300mah battery with superfast charger and 173gms weight, this strikes a perfect balance. Iam not a gamer but i have not experienced any heating issues with day to day usage.\n\nPros:\nSlim and light weight\nCharges in 30 mins\nGreat display\nSmooth UI\nFast finger print recognition\nGreat cameras. Even shoots better than oneplus 8T.\nComes with charger, pre applied screen guard, basic body cover and headphones. These days we have to consider these as pros with stupid trend started by annoying apple.\n\nCons:\nBattery drains faster. But ofcourse this is mainly due to 90hz refresh rate. With the supplied charger this should not even be a problem\n\nOn the whole its definitely a great phone with awesome usability and performance.",

            "Great phone, feel is absolutely premium very light and slim , till now performance is snappy\nDisplay is very gorgeous it's the best thing about the phone, to top it off 65 watt charger is icing on cake\nBut still think it's bit over priced should have been in range of 30-32 k range",

            "Hi guys a very honest review of the phone if you are wanting to go for an premium phone...\n\nUnboxing\n\nWhen I unboxed it it felt like wow the packing is real good and when took out the phone , I think they could have worked on the phone more than the packing.\n\nFound lots of unuseful cardboard , a BIG 65 W Charger , a grade D charging cable and a -D grade ear phones.\n\nAbout the phone\n\nThe phone looks average but when you start the phone the real things start , the phone has excellent features , display but feels a bit heavy to handle. Plus pont is it's not bulky at all so the weight would not bother you in that case.\nUnlike other phones , it's non slippery and easy to handle. Blue colour looks excellent.\n\nRefresh rate is very good at 60hz also and you won't get watery eyes while using this phone for long , so you can watch your best OTT series at a stretch.\n\nBattery \ud83d\udd0b:\n\nHere Oppo must have done more , with that kind of weight they could have easily given this a 5000 MAH + pack, the power plant is just not justified for this product , as I am not playing any games on this phone but the B\nattery needs a charge twice a day even if you have selected this to 60 hz.\n\nCharging :\n\n7 \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f 12 -15 mins and you are back again.\n\nCamera\n\nIs Super I must say Super , but Oppo could have done better for their flagship brand Reno , as they do for OnePlus....\nThere could have been additional benefits for Oppo users , like exclusive club etc...\nBesides the packing Oppo could have done a bit better on the Charging Cable , which feels low grade polymer used in it , this would have come with a braided cable or a better Flexi cable. ( We don't ask for wireless charging in this segment)\n\nThe phone looks beautiful , but Oppo could have done better with something shown in the back center than keeping their logo on left bottom, the centre looks blank....\n\nA new logo of Reno flagship could have added a new zest to this sweet phone...\n\nRear Camera is excellent which captures next to life like pictures with the Amoled display but something doesn't seems right like , it promises to do more but that thing is not available in the Camera .The AI recognition does great wonders to close shots but appears to fail on Zoom ,could have done more better with the zoom , the pixels start to blur when you zoom.\n\nFront Camera is good too but the problem is the preset zoom , it tends take pictures too close for a selfie .\nWhile taking a group selfie you have to look for the tallest person to grab to phone so that everyone can fit into the frame.\nYes there could have been more gestures just than a hand \u270b which would have made it a lot easier for selfies to get clicked.\n\nCharging is Super , Display is A1 , but Oppo could have done better with the curve .\n\nAll together this maybe the best phone with this price tag , you have some copy cats coming with similar copies of this phone , but let me tell ya , Oppo is Oppo.....",
            "Nice phone in 5g segment .it's curve design is awesome and battery back is too good like 1 time charge u will get 24 HR backup . It's take 30 min to full charge and oppo is my favourite phone",

The display is very crisp and the full cornered display gives a great look\nPros:\n1. Looks very premium for the given cost you would absolutely love it.\n2. Screen and display are good\n3. Clear voice quality and audio is also very good.\n4. Phone storage is apt\n5. Phone just take 35 minutes to charge full, in 15 mins to will have apt charging level which can be used for 4-5 hours\n6. It's has an app that smooths up your gaming experience, your notifications and all don't pop up on the screen.\nCons:\n1. The phone battery drains very fast.\n2. The processor is not upto the mark it's a mediatek dimensity processor, the phone has hanging and slowness issue. I play games like pubg on my phone and the game literally hangs while playing\n3. Heats up on heavy usage.\n\nI was using one plus 5 earlier for 4 years and was pretty much happy with the performance, coming to Oppo I think I might not be able to use it for that long.",

It has android 11 out of the box. That's really amazing.\nGetting alot of features\n\nCamera - for now i am satisfied, but i will give reviews, no OIS but has ultra steady mode that is helpful, do remember one thing this feature won't work when you will on AI highlight video and you can't zoom as well\nWill update after some time\n\nFront camera is also satisfying with lot's of features\n\nI do wish it would had OIS and IP rating at least they would have given telephoto lens but upto 2\u00d7 it works like that after that you will start missing telephoto lens\n\nNotification light - who says there is no notification light, notification light is awesome at the edges, just turn on the feature!\n\nConnectivity - awesome\n\nRingtone - awesome\n\n5g connectivity\n\nFingerprint is also fast..\n\nSpeakers - no stereo speakers big disappointment, it has Decent speakers\n\nAfter using 24hours - Got 1 update - January security patch, now fingerprint accuracy got updated, system is getting smooth, colour os improvement",

The color OS very very outstanding UI compare than other OS. value for money i bought it 24K including exchange and offers.",
            "After using this phone. I am saying that the battery backup is very bad but the good thing is fast charging.95% to 50% In a short time without even touching my phone. Phone performance is very good no doubt in that. Good camera quality, Specially Night mode works very nicely.",

            "The product feels quite premium or the price with the best feature being the fast charging.\n\nAlthough I have seen may stating the phone lasts for a day but in my experience with No gaming and a screen on time of about 3 hours the phone dies in about 8 hours probably due to the fact that I get into many calls through the phone daily.\n\nThe smaller capacity Pixel 2 that I was using prior to this lasted me much more than this and I had liked the charging speed of the earlier one capped at 18watts where as this faster charging one seems to get heated up pretty fast on charging and would cause an issue in the long run.\n\nA few apps including netflix doesn't work properly on this as most of the video distorts while viewing forcing me to go over my laptop for any viewing in netflix.\n\nHaven't tested the camera rigoursly but felt better than most in the range but Pixel phones prove a way better photography experience with the software features enabled by Google.",

            "A very well balanced mobile, I got used to it pretty quickly. Oppo has come a long way in terms of the software experience from what I saw back in 2016 and it's one of the best android skins I have seen. I am not a vanilla lover and Oneplus kind of software experience is not my choice. So, for people like me, this UI is definitely a pleasure to use.\n\nPerformance wise it is absolutely smooth and robust.",

The phone is slim and fits in one hand nicely. Camera is good for its daily use. No real complaints about it. The dash charge literally charges the phone to 100% in almost 30-35 mins. This phone do not have headphone jack but it comes with C type headphones bundled in it which is useful. Plays games seamlessly. Playing games like call of duty and others on this is really pleasing on high graphic settings with no lags.",

Build quality and looking is also good . Only one thing I am not happy with is the speaker. At least manufacturer could have given stereo speakers in place of normal speakers.

I am using this mobile since 5 days and it feels realy premium except the fact that the camera hype didn't meet the hype it created.yet a pretty nice product at this price point. The retro background effect with the object being with color option doesn't work some. Hopefully oppo will get it sorted with future updates. Overally one of the best 5g products in the market.",
            "I am using this phone for last 8 day. My first feeling while unboxing the phone just wow. I like the camera quality and featuresof both front(32) an rare camera(64). You will get primiare feeling while holding the phone. Display is superb with supur amoled and borderless screen. I was little bit confuse with processor that is it right to take meditak over Snapdragon. Though. Snapdragon 865 is best one as of now but Dimencity 1000+ also good. So I am happy with the performance. Some time I felt that this phone have lightly heating issue but that is ignorable. Last not the least the Charing with 65w adapter too good.It lightning fast. My view regarding this phone Very good.. little bit over price. May be if it is arround 30,000 then It was great. But If you want to use flugship phone then you have to spent money.

Definitely not the camera. Yes, there are quite a few quirks. Not flagship-level though.\nAny Mediatek Processor is inferior to a Snapdragon. Yes, it does charge very quickly, but it gets warm quite quickly too. Even for a 30 mins normal usage.\n\nThe Good-\nDecent build quality and lightweight.\nThe screen. The curved screen is where I got sold. It does live up to the expectations.\nColor OS is okay. Nothing to complain.\nThe Bokeh mode in video shooting is a serious plus for some audience.\n\nThe Bad -\nThe thing that this phone does not stand out on anything else except a good display is a bummer.\nSince Flipkart has a buyback guarantee, no qualms. But yes, at 35k+, this is bloody overpriced.\nThe much-advertised camera is a serious letdown. Yes, it gives you good pictures and video, but my 2-year-old one plus does the same as well.\n\nWill update after a few weeks",

Experienced the same with calls as well.\n2. Battery backup I would say is average on full charge and with very basic use also it's just lasting for 6-7 hrs.\n3. Networking issue at times.

Definitely gives a premium in hand feel\nOS- Colour OS 11 running on Android 11 is add free and very close to stock Android.\nCharging- Extremely fast 65 watt Super Vooc charges the phone from 0 to 100% in just below 35 mins.\nCameras- photography is of very good quality both from front and rear camera, but the main highlight is the video recording. So many AI features that we may get in flagships only.\nCons-\nHeating issue- heating issue is there if u do any heavy task or prolong game play, but it cools down very fast as well.\nMixed feeling-\nAudio- No dual speakers, but Dolby Atmos has done a good job to maintain a balance between treble and bass from 1 speaker.\nBattery performance- this is mediocre but not disappointing, easily gives me a full day on average to high usage. But special mention to 65 watt charger, charges the phone blazing fast.",

            "After 10 days of normal operation my observations are:\n1) On one full charge you can last for 12 hours running easily with heavy use of data and hotspot too. Also it has power saving and ultra power saving mode that can extend your battery below 20 and 10 percent restricting to less features and talk only respectively.\n\nCharging: 5 star to charging. Because it literally charges to 100percent from 5 percent in 30 minutes.\n\nSo due to fast charging feature you can ignore battery backup issue for heavy running throughout the day.\n\n2) I felt cheated by Flipkart because it clearly mentioned in feature section about dedicated memory slot which is not here and it is 128gb internal storage device so in future when u load more apps and with memory getting full due to large size videos and photos u may have to start transferring ur files to external storage.\n\n3) Camera is good...not worth of 36k phone. On first sight the hullabaloo around its camera seems not that worth. Especially, the night mode for which they advertised (keeping in mind the 32500 for which I paid for it).\n\n4) for gaming it is good as heating can be ignored, not of considerable amount.\n\nBut my only regret is that with 32500 phone they should either increase internal memory or give memory card slot",
