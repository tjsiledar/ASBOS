It works well for multi tasking.\n\nit has negatives too\n1. Phone is very bulky,& heavy unlike other Vivo phones. If you are in bed nd use it for an hour or so you will get tired\n2. Display/visibility in day light is very poor.\n3.Size of this phone is too big to carry in jeans pocket.\n\nConclusion: at almost same range there's redmi 11S comes with 108 MP camera. I think you should do compare in Google for these phones nd then make a decision.",
