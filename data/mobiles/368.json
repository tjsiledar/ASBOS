            "At this price range Poco m2 is an absolute killer\ud83d\udc4d\nMany are posting negative review about camera.\nCamera is an average performance. But you can get the mosr out of it by using Pro mode. By considering other features like price, display, performance , battery etc\nCamera can be acceptable.\nAnd also the battery takes about approx 2.5hr to get fully charged. I have checked with 18watts fast charger, it appears to be the charging speed increases at the range of 10% to 60% percentage but after 60% the charging speed is same as of stock 10watts charger. Those who need a quick boost at low battery, 18 watts charging helps thought at the end both takes almost same time for 100%.\n\nThe 6 gb ram with g80 processor is absolutely delighted can perform daily task with ease and even plays pubg very smooth. Ofcourse its not a flagship device.\nBy considering this price range i really recommend those who is having a tight budget and searching for a high performance device with 6gb ram.\n2 of my friends brought the poco m2 after seeing mine and they are really satisfied.\n\nThankyou \ud83d\ude0a",

Very fast fingerprint sensor\n6. P2i splash proof, ir sensor, fast charging, etc...\nCons:\n1. Sometimes the camera takes dull pics\n2. I often experience some brightness issues when using phone in sunlight and in outside, the pictures look somewhat dull and little colourless, but in indoor it is quiet awesome\n3. My charging adapter gets heated.\n4. No back case in the box.\n\nFinally in this price it is quite awesome phone to buy",

            "Phone performance is good but camera is little average side. Rest everything is fine. And that 10Watt charger it's like useless it's take almost more than 4 hour to charge and battery last for 1 day. In my opinion if you want a gaming phone in budget segment go for it. If you want good camera it never recommend this.\n\nNever trust Flipkart policy they just fool customers\n\nIt's a genuine review",

I haven't seen reviews for Poco M3 which you may consider by paying a premium as have got some trust in the brand as got a Poco X3 after this turned out well.\n\nIt's finally starting to break away from Xiaomi to get an independent image with no ads.",

Primary camera not upto the mark, as it's mentioned it's 28MP but image quality is very poor, reddish and not cristal clear as I was expected. Front facing 8MP is looking fine as compare to it.

Also, you can't use it for a long time, your eyes strain and it does pain.\n\nMusic on the device directly is pathetic.

A horrible experience. I contact flipcart on very next day for a return/replacement but denied though offered an online trouble shooting, but none called.

It moves but very slowly....and everyone knows that if wo don't get expected proformance form new phone, how it feels like. But it's okey now I am trying to adjust with this phone..cuz I don't have extra budget right now. I'll go for a better phone under 15000 after some months. Please suggest me a better phone under that price if it's possible to you..\nAnd I want add in my statement that flipkart is very helpful over any problem we face regarding the product we bought\n#Thank you Flipkart",

I am surprised by the rear camera. Primary senser is just 13 mp but it does excellent job in this price segment. Camera sample attached.\n5. performance is great\n6. face unlock works smooth.\n\nCons:\n1. Selfie camera is useless, even my 5 years old previous moto g4 plus had a better selfie camera.\n2. Miui 12 sucks in terms of ads, junk apps which you can't uninstall. Most people would love all the themes, wallpapers and all, but I love stock clean android. I even noticed some bugs. Some inbuilt features not working. Xiaomi really need to done some work on their OS.\n3. The G80 processor is good. I noticed slight lag while playing asphalt 9. But i believe it can be improved by an update.\n4. The charging speed is slow.\n5. The most annoying thing is the 3.5mm jack placement. it is very badly placed at the bottom. it annoys you while playing games, watching videos with headphones.\n6. Also the back side fingerprint sensor is badly placed. But I works smooth.\n7. And its heavy, i mean my fingers started paining only after 2 days of usage.",

That's okay.\nBox doesn't consist of back cover.\nGames performance is excellent. More than one can ask for. Very smooth.\nCharging speed with 18watt charger is fast. It's supported. If you charge for long hours , then use box charger only. If you want fast charging upto 60%, then buy 18 watt charger.\n\nGPS calibration is not good. I don't know why. Always shows location not accurately. About 1-2 km distant from actual location.\n\nReduced one star just because of camera. It's not upto the mark. Better use it only for documents.
