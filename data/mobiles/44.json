            "I am writing this review after using this mobile phone for 2 days . First of all, I would like to thanks POCO for manufacturing this wonderful phone.\n\nLook : The design of the phone is quite attractive with a different back camera panel having a logo \"poco\" of the company. Body colour texture is excellent. It looks quite premium product. With a plastic back cover, there will be no fingerprint stick with your phone. Although, due to high capacity battery, you may feel little bit heavy on your hand while using this mobile. Looking wise, the product is quite similar to realme 3pro or realmi 7 phone. So nothing new. I shall give 4/5 in this part.\n\nDisplay : The clarity of the picture is excellent, colour reproduction on screen is brilliant. I have been using realme phone for one year and this poco m3 is quite similar or even better from that phone. So I will give 5/5 for display.\n\nSound : With stereo speakers, the audio output of this mobile is extraordinary. I am very much satisfied. Watching movie or listening music is going to be a very pleasant experience for everyone who has got this phone. So 5/5 is here.\n\nSpeed and performance : I am a regular user of mobile phone. I don't play game to much. For normal user, speed and performance of this phone is just above average. Again I will give 5/5.\n\nBattery : Powered with 6000 mah battery, it is quite massive and you can run your phone for a couple of days with a single charge. You can't ask any more. The battery will take around 2 hours to get full charge . It is quite acceptable time keeping in mind the 6000 mah size of the battery. Again 5/5 is here.\n\nSensors : Fingerprint sensor is mounted over power bottom and it works very well. The IR sensor is something bonus. It also works very well. The proximity sensor is also excellent. So I will be giving here 5/5 for sensors.\n\nCamera : In my experience, this is a point where the phone required considerable improvement. The picture quality of front and rear camera is just average. Colour reproduction of the camera is not so good. Don't believe on 48 megapixel. This is just a number, I suppose. So 3/5 here.\n\nUser Interface : Powered with MIUI interface, you will feel very comfortable while operating with your phone. But there are some pre-installed softwares and games, which are quite unnecessary. So it should be cleaned. Again I will give 4.5/5 here.\n\nLastly, keeping in mind the price, this is the best budget phone available at present. I hope this review will be helpful for customers who want to have a clear idea about this poco m3 mobile phone.\n\nOverall verdict, in this price range, this is the best phone and I will be happy to recommend this poco m3 mobile phone for every users,,,,,,,\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf",
            "Best phone in this price... Awesome camera,performance,display.... Camera work best in 48 mp .....",
            "1) Delivery on time, Properly packed with bill copy\n\n2) In the box POCO has Mobile (Tempered glass pre installed), Charger, Transparent case cover and Manual.\n\n3) Out of the box, visually the phone looks appealing. Rear camera placement and design choice looks good on the phone.\n\n4a) To touch and feel, the rear of the phone feels more like plastic but at the same time it also feels rigid and non slippery cause of the design texture the material offers.\n\n4b) For a big battery it carries, it doesn't look or feel very heavy.\n\n5) Side mount finger print sensor/lock button. Well though out and rightly placed.\n\n6) The device boots faster than QC SD665 device. Android 10 along with 6GB ram makes it smooth and agile, Storage option of 128GB is preferably better considering MIUI pre installed apps take up some space.\n\n7) Smooth FHD Display worth the money. Phone offers additional display options like more warmth / cool / colour saturation as well.\n\n8) Experiencing fast charging 1st hand. Battery charging and backup is Overwhelming! Yet to put through rigorous games.\n\n9) Camera is average. Auto white balance is poor. Exposure is always on the bright side. Needs manual tweeking.\n\n10) Stereo speakers are better than most other phones. Not crisp though.\n\n11) For stock android users this MIUI may not be the best UI experience. Can be customised to personal preference.\n\n12) Privacy wise MI pre installed apps allow most permission as default and disabling app permissions selectively is a time consuming job. Not all of them can be uninstalled.\n\nHave to see how it handles with time.\nBest value for money phone out there right now.",
            "Excellent Phone total value for money camera is good display is excellent and battery is too good. Loved it....",
            "This product was absolutely good and it is very smooth and very useful battery very good camera and very used sensor this phone I guess you wearing this 3 phone and enjoy this life and a party time have a fun day",
            "Everything is better of the phone except of front camera\nFront camera is not as expected and photos are looks like normal cameras\nApart from this battery is superrrbbb\nLook it hot\nPerformance is good\nRear camera is great\nSpeaker :- Works both of the speaker while playing any sound and sound is awesome\nScreen visibility is also great",
            "The phone is quite good and value for money.\n\n* Camera is kind of okay, can't complaint while considering the price.\n\n* Battery is above average, will stand for at least one and a half day for normal use. For heavy user's, I think it might stand for one day.\n\n* Display is IPS LCD display which work's very well and the quality is good for the price; also it is best display in among LCD .\n\n* Performance is satisfying, the Chipset handle's daily tasks smoothly and as this is a mid-range Chipset it can hand little heavy work's, while from the point of price we can't compliant it too much .\n\n* UI experience was good , there is not much ad's and it's feels kind of clean experience . But the UI optimization is not too good, I felt some glitch while using it.\n\n*About phone weight, I didn't feel it too heavy. It's good in hands. It's my personal opinion might be different opinion for different person's.\n\nFinal verdict, this phone is an all-rounder, it has some down's but it make it up by it's stronger part's. For this price this phone is value for money. However,there is other phone's in the market with some extra specs ; if you can push your budget further then go for it otherwise you can choose this phone you won't disappoint.",
            "Thank you Flipkart for such a nice mobile in such a great deal. Phone camera performance is good i like it",

            "Battery is not good as shown, with regular use hardly last one day even in fresh new condition.\nUpon using for an hour for zoom call, the phone started to heat up too much.\nCamera is pathetic, even Redmi Note 4 camera is of same quality for pictures.\nDisplay is also average and so as touch screen, many times touch sensor not working, u need to try twice or thrice.\nFinger sensor also not working properly.\nOverall not a good phone even in budget range as most of the features given in specifications are only on paper and not in practical.",

            "This is my geniune review with POCO M3.\nBasically I am a one plus 8 User and purchased M3 Just for its design. I have purchased 2 varients of yellow color with 6gb 64gb.\n\nfirst of all I would say stay away from the negitive reviews.\nMy honest review is, If you are looking for a great phone under 10-11k, definitely go for M3 6gb 64gb.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, i have purchased 2 phones, I have not faced any lag, heat issue, battery issue and nothing.\n\nDisplay is really good in this price segment. Colors are very good and smooth! 4.5/5\nDesign - 10/10 Yellow with matt finish 5/5\nPerformance - As per SD 662 the performance is very decent if you are a daily user not a gamer. this will satisfy you with your usage. 5/5\nStorage - I would say best in this budget. 5/5\nCamera - I wouldnt say that the best camera but yes in daylight its very decent, but in some situations in low light it performs very well. overall i would say camera 3.5/5\nSpeakers - Really very loud and very clear. 5/5\nBattery & charge - I would say that battery is really good. no heat issues nothing. On first charge it will take around 2- 2:30- hours but afterthat around 60 minutes for 0-100% and no battery drain issue.\n\n\nFInal - If you are looking for a Great design, display with good colors, battery, speakers and Poco launcher and budget is 11-12k definitely go for Poco M3 it will never disapoint you but if your priority is camera, You can go with Mi note 9 pro or max.",
            "Bought this one for normal use and its Great.\nGo for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good. The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.\n\nIf u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice. It produces darker images.\n\nBattery is great and charging takes about 2 hr 15 min as it has 6000 mah battery.\n\nDisplay is also good produces good colours.\n\nU can do Gaming on this one but at medium settings.",
            "really liked this phone. Where is its people and it is very good in battery and its rate and everything is fine. But the little camera in it is not good. Still I think. Very good which performance is talked about. The ground is fine to a great extent.",
            "It's a globally launched phone and I needed a back up phone immediately after my OnePlus 7pro got stolen, so got it delivered next day and is been using this phone for past weeks. So the best thing is the screen and battery back up which continues for me for a full day though charging speed is slow and performance also slow but manageable. Front camera not upto the mark and back camera is better as this price range. Miui 12 is buggy and still needs updates for stability.\nI had to reinstall the latest software to get better quality sound output which I was facing from day one. After update the ear piece volume working fine. The phone doesn't heats up nor hangs and works perfectly even the processing is slow. I have removed the animation so it gets faster processing. Build quality is top notch and back grip is so damn good. For normal usage it's a good phone.",
            "Iam using this phone is 1week then i write a review.Thank you so much flipkart. This phone is use very nice and cemara is also good and Battery power is good\nPerformance is good overall good phone",
            "Phone looks sturdy and the display is great...sound is the best thing about the phone...buttons are nicely placed. front camera is not so good..but back camera is nice. overall a nice phone",
            "After around 1 month of usage-Even though its a budget phone the intial days Mi Note 3 worked well than this. It sometimes get hanged and when I tried to download a 1 gb file from internet. It restarted itself.\nSo performance wise not good.\nNothing is great. Can't have a Google feed normally also.\nFeeling likw giving it back",
            "Poco m3 mobile products are good i am happy\nCamara quality is good and battry performance exillent\nSound quality very good",
            "First I say flikart very vast one day delivery I'm impressed.\nPhone nice color\nCase also worthy.\nBattery backup nice.\nCamera not bad \ud83d\udc4d(may be they any software updates it's get better performance).\nI'm vary happy with poco m3\nI'm satisfied value for money.",
            "Hi friends,,,this is really very nice mobile in this price segment,,, using after 1 week i wrote this review i like very much,,,,before I buy checked reviews some guy say it's average mobile ,,,but it's really nice ,,,battery is super 1 full day easily come,,,mobile performance speed also very good,,,,nice display,,,,but the camera is average also not bad,,,,so I really said ,,,guys thinking in this price range surely go for it ,,,,thanks flipkart",
            "If u are buying this phone seeing the 48 megapixel back camera dont buy this phone instead go for a phone which diacloses the sensor it uses (sony Or samsung).\nThis phone has the worst selfie camera\n\nThe good feature it has is u get 2 speaker one at top and the other at bottom which gives u a surround sound effect.\nA 18watt fast charger and the finger print on the power button",
            "Horrible phone\nWhy?\n1-It heat up while charging and playing games\n2- Phone sensitive very less\n3- there's no hands free call in game turbo so it's a pain in the neck when call came while playing games\n4- 4GB ram works faster than this pathetic 6GB ram\n5- you cannot tap forward or backward while watching YouTube but have to drag the player every time which is disgusting\n6- battery never last as how it mention in the specification (4000 mah is better )and to fully charge it took almost 4 hours\n7- everyone says about camera so I don't have to repeat\n\nPS- if you buy this phone and haven't experience the thing I mention above post purchase, I'll refund you the amount you paid for this phone",
            "I am purchase this phone before 15 day's.\nCamara is good\nBattery is powerful\nPerformance also good\nAll the things is good not best\nBut in this prize range it is best phone\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",
            "This phone is pretty decent\nBattery backup and display quality is very good at this price range\nSpeacker sound quality is also good\nPerformance is pretty fast .\nBut only low and balance and high frame rate support on pubg.\nCamera quality is good.",
            "I received my Poco M3 today (delivered by Ekart in 2 days). These are my first impressions.\n\nDesign and build: Fits well in hand and it's side mounted finger print scanners ls also placed in an optimal location. A simple plastic back with curved edges. Feels little heavy.\n\nDisplay: Looks stunning with great colours and balanced and adaptive brightness. It's Full HD+ display is Ideal for watching videos. 60Hz refresh rate is good considering the budget but as I shifted from high end one plus, I felt it little slow.\n\nBattery: It seems to be decent (I have used it for 3 hours heavily and it is down by 25%). Charging takes little longer time, maybe because of high capacity battery.\n\nCamera: It is an average camera (satisfied for price range but don't fall for the numbers or pixels). Performs well under bright light and average under low light. Front camera is below average. So there might be phones clicking better photos in this price range.\n\nSpeaker: This is where Poco M3 beats all it's competitors, thanks to it's dual stereo speakers which steals the show. Undoubtedly best in the segment. (If you don't compare with high end phones)\n\nPerformance: 6gb ram ans Snapdragon 662 sounds fine for this budget section and it performs decently. Cannot expect a heavy performance from a budget smartphone.\n\nStorage: Comes with so many pre installed apps and games, but fortunately they can be uninstalled so 64gb varient is handy and 128gb is anyways a better varient with a higher speed.\n\nUI : It is typical MIUI, so if you have used MI phones it won't be confusing but the ones switching from other company phones might take a little time for getting used to it. Many Mi apps are also installed. It doesn't seem to be ads free though.\n\nOveral Verdict: The phone is well balanced in all areas. If you want to use it mainly for watching videos or movies then go for it without a thought. Battery is good and performance is decent. If you are a camera enthusiast, then better find other alternatives.\n\nThat's all for few hours of usage. Hope you find it helpful!",
            "The phone looks like very good and also i liked the MI Launcher very much. But, other thinks are average.\n\nI didn't expect this type of camera, camera is very poor...\n\nThe phone Heating is a big problem and also charger.\nWhen you plugged the charger for 1hour the heating of the charger looks like, you charged the charger for 10hour. Charger and phone heating is not normal..\n\nI tell that you have to compare other phone at this price range(Narzo 20,MI 9 power) before you buy POCO M3",

            "Honest review after 1 week use\nNegative point\n1.low quality camera like 8mp\n2.battery not 6000mah it's like 4500mah\n3.Slow charging 100% charge take 5.5h\n4.Ram not 6gb it's like 4.5gb\n\nOverall good",
            "Worst camera quality.. Taking more time to get full charge..",
            "Good product. Best product under this value of cost. Heating is the only issue found when charging and usage while playing games. Otherwise nice product. Battery backup remarkable, 1 day for heavy using and 1\u00b3/4 nearly 2 days for moderate using. Camera is some what deserving. I'm using this for one month. You can also prefer Poco M3 if u are satisfied with my knowledge of choice.",
            "This phone is best phone underr 11,000 according to price its battery, display and smoothness is best.\nCamera is not so good because it has 48 +2+2 camera setup but it not feels like that it feels like only 20Mp. Poco has to improve this camera quality issue.. But rest of all things are best..",
            "POCO M3 is good phone but it have a very cheapest display the colors of display is very bad many times its display gave the some issues. It is not even good for childrens.\n\nThe processor ram and camera is very good but display is very bad some time i touch any appp and its open other app",
            "I find it very suitable for my needs and give me value for money. As I don't game in mobile and don't have any fascination with cameras I am OK with the camera performance and overall phone performance.\n\nCon:\n\n1. Although 6000mAh battery, feels like 4500.\n2. The earpiece from where the sound comes out while talking over phone is not that loud. You have to use headphone for clear voices.",

            "Nice phone I have buy in my life. IT is a super phone. I had watched some reviews on Flipkart they are saying selfie camera is very poor but my Poco m3 has a funtastic selfie and back camera.In this price range it is a super phone.I am using it for 10 days and I am saying this review.Its performance is super",
            "Date of review: 11/05/2021(\nI bought 6gb/128gb varient which is recommended if you buy this mobile. Lower varients varies with some hardware eg. storage type.\nIf you can't break the budget line of 12k then today I can say that this is the best smartphone under 12k.\nIf you can spend a minimum of thousand or more to buy a smartphone then it is not the best choice because better processors available at 13k smartphones.\nPros:\n1. Best battery backup\n2. Only amoled display smartphone under 12k\n3. Descent Rear camera\n4. Best performance\n5. Moderate front camera performance (Good only in best lights)\n6. No UI ads(read 6th point in cons)\n7. If you are concerned with your privacy, they don't collect our data about us directly with the UI(read 7th con)\nCons:\n1. Display is clear only when viewed straight. If you view it with different angles the display will not be clear.\n2. Definately need a software optimization to clear bugs(too many)\n3. No smooth ui interface which should be cleared with software upgrade\n4. It is compatible to upgrade only upto Android 11\n5. No wide angle camera(Rear view)\n6. Too many ads in applications (which can be disabled)\n7. But they collect data with their bloatwares which they force us to use it. So be careful on accepting terms and conditions of any apps not only in this device but also in all mi devices\n\n\nOverall the smartphone is good to use if you know how to use smartphones smart and safely.",
            "Two biggest cons:-\n1) This SD662 soc is not optimised by Xiaomi for MIUI. Poco launcher shucks bigtime.\n2) Camera is pathetic.\n\nPROS:-\n1) Camera 2 api full support - Gcam does wonders.\n2) Install Nova launcher prime and feel the smoothness.\n3) Battery life is too good.\n4) Fast charger 22W provided in box though phone supports only 18W.",

            "Review after 40 days\n\nBest phone if u r more of a streaming user than a gaming user...!!\n\nI bought this for my father who only uses this for the basics, whatsapp & youtube..All i wanted was 128gb int., A big drainless battery with fast charger included & killer looks...Poco M3 provided these 3 within 11.5k is a pretty good deal..\nAs i said if u r a mediocre user as above mentioned, this is best for u...Bt if u dont much care about looks & instead looking for something more superior go straight away to realme narzo 30...It has all the above features plus a far superior processor & imoroved performance..\n\nFYI the reduced one star is for the poor camera quality..its just a better version of old VGA cams...Camera dept is that poor...Except that this phone is a perfect dealbreaker for under 12k budjet..!!",
            "Used it for 1 month and got all the features described... I am happy with this phone and if you are a fan of playing games like Free fire you should buy it.... \ud83d\ude01",
            "Writing after using for 10 days.\n\n-Comes with high quality silicone case inbox, its perfect, tight fitting and has a neat flip on cover for charging port (POCO M2 does not come with case).\n-22.5 charger is fast but also heavy & bulky (Mi 18 watt charger is much sleeker & lighter).\n-Battery life from its 6,000 mAh is great. Supports reverse charging but strangely we still get impure USB C cable & USB A charger, so one needs to buy & carry a pure USB C cable seperately.\n-Phone has good decent width of 77mm making it quiet comfortable to hold and use.\n-Display at 1080 is decent, sunlight usage feels a tab better than M2, however it's brightness nits at 400 is the same, for good direct sunlight visibility look for ph of higher nits.\n-Stereo speaker is sort of Ok. Infact M2 despite having solo speaker seemed better sounding.\n-Cameras: not a fan of taking pictures, so unable to comment.\n-Side finger print scanner takes some getting used to, the sensor scanning area (power button) is small compared to rear sensor of M2, so sometimes have to touch multiple times for it to recognise & also seems to take a fraction longer in comparison.\n-Phone is quiet responsive and quick overall to load apps, data files etc. Probably due to high speed UFS 2.2 ROM (128GB) and 6 GB RAM.\n\nAs seems to be the case with a number of phones these days, it lacks LED notification light (ditto with M2). So one to has double tap & wake up ph every now and then to check for notification, Hope that manufacturers introduce it back on all forthcoming phs and make it a standard feature, this is probably more useful than IR blaster considering all modern TV, Audio etc have Bluetooth remotes and don't work on IR.\nOriginally Purchased M3 with the plan to sell off M2, but after using for 10 days, ended up selling M3 on OLX for 1k less than purchased price and went back to my earlier ph POCO M2, mainly due to its convenient & faster rear fingerprint sensor, auto call record feature & slightly better audio.\n\nStill POCO M3 is a great ph offering fantastic value.",

            "Its ridiculous, I mean it's seems like a fraud. I m using POCO C3 from 1 year. It's very good till now. But after delivery of POCO M3 its battery seems like 3000mAh, it's finger print sensor is worst, It's speakers sound is good. It's hang all the time. It's RAM management is very poor. I don't know what happening in POCO.\nGo for other smartphone or little bit upgrade your budget.",
            "My real review after 10 days of use-battery heat up more when it goes from 15 to 40 then normal heat up till 75. Then no heat up.\nFront camera is not good but ok, back is very good.\nIt have many hidden Features. And remaining is normal.\nIf you to want to buy you can get poco m3 6 gb ram Or 64storage at 9999 in a sale. As these days sale continue from 2 may to 7 may. All over it is a good phone under 10,000.",
            "I am writing review after using phone for approximately 20 days. I am not a big game lover, so haven't played games on this device but performance wise there phone is excellent.\n\nPros:\n\n- Excellent screen size and resolution. Good to read ebooks, watching videos.\n- Plenty of useful modes such as reading mode, black and white mode, normal and ultra bettery saver mode which can save a lot of battery in case of traveling.\n- Best performance in normal use like watching YouTube video and Netflix.\n- Amazing battery. Lasts 48 hours for continuous usage.\n- Quick charging. It takes around 3 hours for phone to charge from 1% to 100%.\n- I was worried about bloatware since it's MIUI, but there are very few number of pre-installed apps which comes in phone which we can't uninstall, so we have to disable them when we don't need them.\n- Phone provides excellent options to manage background running apps.\n\n\nCons:\n- Camera quality is below average. Low light (Indoor) photos are not that good.\n- Front camera is average, sufficient for video calling but not as per expectation for low light selfies.\n- of you're not using phone cover, phones body is bit slippery.\n\nBut these cons are manageable since it's 12k phone we can't expect everything.",

The phone heats up little up when playing high ram consuming games like gangster Vegas but I love the game boost feature it instantly cleans up the phone when playing the game\n5.Finally it is a very good phone to buy at 10k",

The only limitation of Gcam is you can take maximum 12mp pictures even though poco m3 holds 48mp senser.",

But one thing I want to remind them, if they want best camera quality like 64 Mp or more, then they will have to understand that 48Mp is good at this price base. So, my suggestion is that the Emptor will go buy regarding this price. Hence, I am giving 4 out of 5 star for Camera quality.\n\n2. Display---- Quality is best, I thi...\nREAD MORE",
            "A very good mobile with bad camera. Everything is fine, the battery lasts atleast one day for any kind of user. Display is 1080p and at this price range is a real steal. Processor is Snapdragon 662 which is enough for most of gamers also. Starts with base model 6gb ram and 64 gb storage. The MIUI12 is good but still, there are some lags and frame drops only because of the UI. Coming to camera, this mobile has the worst front facing camera. It's completely useless in my opinion. And coming to rear camera it's pretty average or even below average in my opinion. But at outdoor with high lighting conditions you may get lucky with some good photos. I bought this mobile in the first sale for 10,000. For this price, yes it is a value for money mobile. If you need camera, then this is definitely not the mobile for you.",

            "I bought it clearly knowing that it is below par in the processor segment. The laxity is compensated partly with the above average ram and rom for this price level.

            "Detailed Review after 10 day use\nPros\n-Look is awesome and fresh. The yellow colour comes out as very vibrant. The screen display too is very good. Though slightly low in bright sunlight.\n-Performance wise it works pretty well. No lag or hanging issue seen while playing games or using heavy apps\n-Wifi and network speed is very good\n-Power bckup even after heavy usage is excellent.\n-Rear camera does the job for you and gives pretty decent pictures.\n-Face unlock and finger print unlock works fairly well\n\nCons\n-Front camera is not what you would expect. Night time selfies are worse\n-Phone is bit bulky\n-Charging time even after fast charger support is quite long\n\nConclusion - If you're not a selfie fan then this phone is a beast. Performance and power bckup is 10/10. You can go for it",

Camera,battery,ram, speakers are good but buy a phone buy it processer not ram.I give 4 stars its a good phone.If you want a poco buy poco m2pro or poco x3 its have good processer.Poco m3 not another issues its good not overheating heating only in charging because 6000mah battery at 18 watt charging.Its became Full charge in 2.30 hrs.Over all perfomance is desent.Not a bad phone.No another issues.Only 2 issues that is charging time and medium proccesser.Its a good phone .",

I'm not a gamer at all but I use a hell lot of apps ranging from transportation like Uber to shopping like Flipkart, fitness apps like Strava besides the usuals like Adobe reader, Spotify etc. And on using it for over 10 hours, I still get around 60% battery at the end of the day.",

            "I was in the lookout for a good phone for my father and thankfully I came to know about this product through one of my friend. Poco M3 was a good buy.\n\nI have to admit, the camera even though its 48megapixel, I'm not sure if it does the job properly as the quality of the image is under par !\n\nThe varient that I bought for my dad was the 6gb + 128 gb and I must say this is a very smooth transition for him considering his old phone. The battery life is awesome, on an average my dad can use his phone for almost a day and half after one single charge (the charging takes time somewhat 2- 2:30hrs) and it's better to keep your phone for charging at night. The performance of this phone is also was not that bad.\n\nAnd thanks to flipkart I got a decent exchange rate for my old phone and hence I could get this one for below 9k\nSo overall I am happy customer.\n\nN.B. If camera is your main priority with almost the same features, then I would recommend poco m2 pro which comes around 12k\n\nAlso shout out to the delivery guy from EKart (Abhijit) who helped with delivery of this phone on time !\n\nThanks",

            "Phone is awesome at this price range. I have bought it under 10k in the festive season. I actually bought it for my mom for her birthday. It's good phones for elders which has maximum calling and limited gaming.\n\nBattery is good for daily use.\n\nPhone charges at normal speed not big difference with fast charging.\n\nNo lag found, refresh and touch pretty faster.\n\nCamera is above average.\n\nGood to go for this budget",

            "I have using this device it's been a week now, all over performance is really snappy, it feels lot like stock android because of its poco launcher, Google apps loads to quickly and give snappy performance it feels like using pixel device, I'm not a camera enthusiasts but camera is overall ok no problem for me. Battery is really awesome i charge it around 94 and still at the end of the day is dropped on 30. I have 6/128 gb varient i suggest to go for 128 because of today's apps are getting heavier 128 is also less for them.",
            "I bought this phone same day on it's launched in India. It's a good mobile with fast charging and brilliant battery backup.. Camera quality is fine, it has automatic filter in the front camera which I don't like. It gets hot fast while playing games so it is good that I'm not a games lover, however, my kids play games on it and I keeps worrying of them... I have given 4 stars because battery backup and fast charging was the priority.",
            "Battery backup is very good but charging is very slow I think company are cheating us to show fast charging option is available with it.\nRear camera is average but front camera is not upto expectations.\nOperating performances is good no heating issue observed.\nWeight is slightly higher sound quality and loudness is just average.\nInstead of soft case if provided headphone with it shall be better.\nOverall I will give rating for battery backup 5/5, charging-1/5, camera quality- 3/5, sounds quality -3/5, performance -4/5.\nAnyone can purchase it if not interested in camera quality and can bear more charging time for 50% charging it took 2 - 2.5 hrs but battery backup is very good.",
            "Overall the review of the phone is quite good and I want to say that I liked it quite well for that I want to add that the camera must provide a very good performance and after that ok it is good it is best for me because I have paid nearly 12000 rupees and the product is very very greater than worth it",

I am able to make that comparison because my previous phone of infinite hot 10 with same configurations never use to lag.\n\u2022 Interface is mediocre and lags when you switch from one page to another.\n\u2022 Camera is ordinary.\n\u2022 While charging sometimes phone get super heated.\n\u2022 Though they claim it's maha battery phone but honestly for me a new phone with 6000 mha should have given more battery life. My battery drain in a day on full charge.But the speed of charging is good.\n\n\nOne of the biggest drawback of this phone is that it's doesnt have call auto reporting features. It has weird option of manual call recording and other caller can hear that calls are recorded which they will find discomforting and create mistrust. Their is no other way to record rhe calls.\n\nSo if you are looking for phone with call recording options this phone is useless.\n\nThe Snapdragon processor performance is really poor in all terms.\n\nI suggestion learn from my mistake.",

            "After few months of use I'm pretty confident on my opinion of what type of a smartphone this POCO M3 is. I have got the 6/64 GB variant so some of what I say will be viable for that variant only as with a less amount of ram the experience will be a little different but shouldn't be drastic. 1st and foremost the skin-MIUI for POCO although an improvement from the regular MIUI found in Xiaomi's other brands, it's still buggy and resource intensive. The simple fact that the \"control centre\" looks like Apple's and it's seperate from notifications is a far cry from what Google is doing with their take on Android and stock Android itself as well as most of other skins from other manufacturers operating in this country. Yes it is possible to change it back to old style but it's called 'old 'why would I want that in my new phone? According to my opinion, a User Interface is what a user interacts with, so it's stability and smoothness should be the topmost priority for a company but with increasingly competitive cost cutting and the smartphone landscape in India, smartphone companies neglect this very critical part, as evident from Xiaomi's attempt in this smartphone. But there's a saving grace for this smartphone that if you are comfortable and willing to risk your warranty, the bootloader can be unlocked easily and you can install a large variety of OSs or Skins. On a final note about the MIUI, the update situation is also lacking and regular security patches and updates is a no show (but to be fair most of the companies are like that too). Talking about the performance, the combination of Qualcomm Snapdragon's 662 SoC and 6 GB if ram makes it a really good and capable handset. For most of regular use (if the UI isn't lagging) it's a breeze to use. Some form of smartphone gaming is actually possible with this, but I am not a mobile gamer so I haven't actually explored that front myself. Now changing my attention to the build and feeling of the handset, I would say it's pretty decent. I mean it's plastic but it's got it's advantages and disadvantaged as all the things in life do! The plastic doesn't feel squeaky and cheap. The only thing is the black variant (which I have) has a giant logo at the back. Now I understand it's a technique for the brand to stand out in this crowded Indian market, the logo and brandings on the yellow variant makes it appealing, but people generally buy the black variant to not do that. The side mounted fingure print sensor is fast and accurate, you shouldn't even need to look at your device before it's opened as you reach the power button and your thumb gets scanned in the scanner. The USB type C port present is a USB 2 variant not the newer USB 3 so the transfer speeds are slow, so patience is required if transferring large files over the USB. The display and the speakers are also very good but not exceptional as I hoped! The speaker although being a stereo, has unbalanced sound from the top (earpiece) and bottom speaker, but the volume is pretty loud, with little pops and crackles when heard at max volumes in some songs. The headphone jack present in this device is also very good, there's no electrical noise that I can hear, as well the output is very respectable. The volume buttons are good and clicky while the same cannot be said about the vibration motor Xiaomi has used. The motor is very weak and doesn't have good haptic feedback. Finally the best part of the smartphone is it's amazing cameras (only 2 worth talking about) and the battery life! The rear 48 MP f/1.8 wide camera is a joy to use in this price point. It produces good and vibrant image, although the saturation is a bit much, but I wouldn't complain about it. The front 8 MP f/2.1 is also pretty decent, while the automatically enabled face smoothening makes every photo an oil painting but once disabled takes very usable pictures. If a Google camera mod apk is installed and setup, that improves the camera much more than the stock app. The 6000 mAh battery has a terrific battery life, and the included 18W fast charger also does a very good job in topping up the battery when in a pinch, but I wouldn't count on it for absolute time crunch. Also this large battery is a confidence inspiring as it will last a longer time as it degrades with charge cycles. Finally this device is very good for the price it's demanding and keeping any brand loyalty aside (as you should) buying this device was a good decision I would say.",

            "Before proceeding I would like to highlight few points.\nEvery seller on Flipkart has his own return & refund policies. Make sure to read it before you buy anything.\n\nI bought this phone on 13th Sept 2021, and have been using the phone for a week.\nFollowing are the issues faced\n\n1. The phone gets overheated, I have previously used Samsung galaxies devices and never ever faced heating issues even after binge-watching Netflix.\nHowever, I am facing these issues with this phone.\n2. The phone gets heated even when charging\n3. Camera quality is not good, I am fully aware that at this price I am not expecting a highly developed camera, but what I disliked about it is it has inbuilt filters that can be reset. I use video calls for my work-related things and nowadays I am not liking, as every video application uses this camera and due to filter, the face is highly weird.\n4. UI is not good for me\n\nI wanted to return and get a refund as I was not satisfied with the product, I was complaining about Flipkart from Saturday, & its services is very slow & not at all customer friendly.\nEvery time a new ticket is created and I had to explain the issues every time from scratch. This is not a good experience.\nFlipkart arranged technician visits and NOTE Flipkart has its own parameters to return the product. My phone is getting heated up to 43 to 44 degrees, and according to Flipkart 48 degrees is the minimum temp to accept the product has a fault.\n\nI kept complaining to Flipkart, but it doesn't matter as they will keep assigning you a technician and a 3rd visit was scheduled for me with the same results, now THE OFFICIAL 7 DAYS RETRUN bracket is finished and now I can't even raise the request for a return.\nFlipkart is very poor when it comes to customer service",

But... you are someone who spends most of their time on web browsing and using some common apps, and other general uses besides gaming then there are some better options by other brands like Motorola and Realme, etc.\nSunlight visibility is really bad. Build quality is unmatchable at this price range. The cameras are not good enough. The haptics you get while using the phone is really great.
