            "I'm reviewing about after using 20 days. Must Say micromax has made a strong comeback with IN note 1. Will be talking about in sequence manner:-\n1. Built quality/quality control:-\nDesign is superb I suggest green color looks really amazing and beautiful. Buttons are quite good and screen is surprisingly really bright and good. Wifi and Bluetooth connectivity and calling is all excellent.\n2. Performance:-\nThe customized stock android is really smooth with Helio G85 processor.\n3. Battery:-\nThis mobile really outperforms in this section must say battery is damm legit, it lasts for 2 days completely even if use it more a day. Also the fast charging with 18W adapter charges in 25 mins to 50% and 100% in 2hrs(approx).\n4.Camera:-\nSome of the samples clicked from this phone looks good. Well the nightmode is really amazing and talking about it's AI functioning it comesout really good.\n\nLastly some cons is that while taking portrait shots it doesn't take a proper portrait. Yes I clicked this pictures after their first updates. So yes this can be fix if they send a further update which will better work on this.\n\nMy Opinion is that supporting our brand will be key to them and yes it's in our hand to make it big or not. It will take some time to make it perfect but we can see better improvements if we support them.\n\nThank You",

            "Super \ud83d\ude1a phone \ud83d\udcf1 good camera good battery backup good display good sound quality pura paisa basul",
            "Best phone in segment\nFirst thing :- build quality is very good according to price haven't any issues\nFirst charge may take more time than usual ( for me it take 4.15 hours for \ud83d\udcaf percent)\nBut on second charge it take 90 minutes to 75% and 2.15 hours to \ud83d\udcaf %\nBattery backup is also very good it give me about 8.30 hours of screen on time.\nFor normal uses battery \ud83d\udd0b last upto 1.5 days.\nScreen quality is also good and brightness is excellent.\nSpeaker quality is good sound is loud and bassy. Earpiece is very good. And earphone output is perfect.\nData connection in also very good it give me more internet speed than my old phone.\nPerformance is upto mark. You can play high graphics games smoothly.\nCamera is just average . It's camera hardware is capable for taking good photos because sometimes is produces good quality photos and sometimes very bad so the problem is in camera software a update can fix that\nNote: currently is doesn't support raw photo capturing so Google camera is not working .but may be in future company can add that.\n\nIn my opinion this is best in segment.",
            "Amazing product, also must buy product for every smartphone user.\nSo greatful to hand one of the Indian smartphone brand's phone\nWant to see micromax to become Apple of Indian smartphone market.\nOne of the best camera,\nfull day battery life,\nMediaatek Helio G85\nBig and Nice display\nSome improvement require in the charge time, needed to increase the capacity of charger, in the app segment needed to give a music app for offline music\ud83c\udfb5",
            "call recording feature is not available in device and no other call recording application work properly in this phone I am not happy with the service of Micromax please push update as soon as possible for call recording then I will be make calls and recording it properly",
            "Micromax in note 1 is not as expected. It is not a good choice to buy. I don't recommend anyone to buy this phone. Quality is poor. Don't buy just because of an Indian brand. This is genuine review. Don't buy.",
            "First thing you will notice, this phone is beautiful looking, all the buttons are well placed, big nice display, back panel is plastic yet finish is really impressive and color is very vibrant.\n1. Display- Display is definitely a high point of this phone.It's Full HD display, very nice, colors are good, loaded with screen guard.\n2.Camera- Outdoor/daylight photos are really good with great clarity and details. Low light photos are fine, but these are similar to almost all phones in the same price segment. Camera has many filters and variety of modes, definitely a good offering. Front camera is 16mp is quite good. Night mode also works really well.\n3.Software-UI is quite good, took few minutes to get adjusted, I believe it will get further improved in the coming updates.\n4.Battery-Its a big 5000mph battery,my usage is normal so it lasts for almost 2 days easily for me.\n5.Speakers- Speakers are really good, loud and clear much better than my previous Mi phone.\n\nOverall it's a good phone, Big thumbs up from my side, worth buying in this price range. Finally it's our very own Made in India phone.",
            "This phone is truly a masterpiece. Move aside Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi and Realme. This is the king of budget phones.\nPros -\n\n1 - Android One - Google OS - Clean and Bloatware free\n2 - Smooth and Ultra Responsive Touch\n3 - Huge and Clear FHD Display\n4 - 128GB space with an additional SD Card Support.\n5 - Dual Sim + SD Card. Not Either Dual Sim or HD card.\n6 - Exceptional Camera Experience.\n7 - Huge Battery with Quick Charge. Lasts a day and a half.\n8 - Dedicated Google Assistant Button.\n9 - 3 year...\nREAD MORE",
            "Well It's my honest review.\nI have seen many Youtubers show that the camera is not good enough but I can assure you that this is the best budget camera phone I have ever seen in this range.\n\nCamera is perfect.\nProcessor is perfect.\nBattery is perfect.\nNo heating issues while charging and play PUBG game.(a little bit heat that is ok).\nScreen is perfect. It's bigger than your expectations.\nThere is no manufacturing error and also the built quality is very fine.\nIt's smoother and UI is decent.\n\nCharging time is little bit long it takes in between 2-3 hrs. And I think that is justified because I get battery backup upto 1.2-1.5 days.\n\nThe wide camera is not good \ud83d\ude14\nI didn't get back cover but Micromax told me they will provide me within 7 days.\n\nMicromax IN 5 out of 5.",

            "I want to thank flipkart and micromax for accepting and processing speedy replacement due to speaker problem.\nMicromax IN note 1 is very good product to compete with other mobiles at this price. Display, Speakers, battery and camera performance is pretty good. IN note 1 is a good option for all at 10k budget.\nI recommend this product and flipkart.",
            "All round product. Just too perfect. Excellent camera very real looking images it's not oversaturated like my realme 3 pro, aslo gives better Bokeh effect.

            "Wonderful mobile in this price segment, also got great discount during festive sale. Camera is good, battery life is also wonderful, overall looks and build quality of the mobile is awesome.",
            "Why some people reject to buying micromax?? it's very old year memory on poor quality and more cost!!\n\nBUT!!\n\nI loved now micromax \"IN\" than other brands like Poco, Xiaomi, MI, Realme, Samsung, Nokia. i was checked all \"in\" mobile are looking awesome and mind blowing!! also lowest cost!!\n\nAll features are excellent. And loved \"IN\" Mobile but i'm not love flipkart service!. Bcoz.. be careful with exchanges, their checker does not accept our mobile properly.. If have one small scratch then they will pay very very less cost!! but better to buy with EMI or pay full amount only. If exchange fail we need to reject lowest price and waste our time with flipkart exchange offer. \"Flip\" means not only for good sound.. they have also hidden cheating with \"Flip Idea\"!! So be careful with exchange offer.\n\nIn the box are.. charging, mobile, back case, warranty card is there.. but flipkart never say about back case amd freebies. only they're showing buy back case.\n\nI'm really saying it. I'm happy and Thank you Micromax team for making great mobile with lowest price.",

            "Very fast performance, it catches signals in low network area very well, lightening fast 4G. This is because it has Carrier aggregation technology, which is not available in any other phone below Rs. 20,000\n\nCall quality is great. It has 2 microphones: 1 primary, 2nd for noise cancellation. Caller can hear you well even in noisy environment.\n\nDisplay is top notch. Speakers are very loud and clear.\n\nCamera is not great but is good enough for a Rs. 11,000 phone. However micromax has released an update to improve camera performance(see attached image). This improves HDR photos, adds Electronic image stabilization etc.\n\nBattery goes on for atleast 2 days if you are not a gamer.\n\nDon't buy back cover separately because it comes with 1 back cover for free.",

However it has this issue with fingerprint sensor that it sometimes doesnt recognize (which is actually quite often) and have some software updates that are to be performed. Otherwise it is a great phone\nActually good value for money as this doesnt have bloatware as in phones like Mi realme poco etc these phones work quite well in the begining but as they age, MI,POCO and Realme can get real slow.\n\nMicromax in note is a good phone overall",

            "Everything is cool and clear . Theme store yet needed . Thanks to micromax product .Power and sound button should have been a bit high or the sound button to be on the left side . Cool display should be completely on white look .",
            "I rec'd the product & the product seems to be good, however small things could have made it the best (Rating 5)\nI) 2.5D hard glass protection over the screen (there is this mental blockage of using branded screen protection... It is creditable that MMX is trying to create its screen protection, but an extra protection would assure the customer in a long way)\nII) If you are dispatching a cover, then please mention in the package description.\nAlso it would have been great, if you could have provided more rounded edge & hardened corner on the cover...\nIII) The battery software can be improved. For instance in the current scenario it dosen't provide info like when the last charging was done, for how long will the battery last etc...\nTo be honest, after reading the -ve remarks (due to the problem of initial batch) I was in a bit of dilemma, whether to purchase the phone or not, but glad that I took the plunge...\nThe phone appears to be well built, not sturdy but I think the built can be comparable to that of other smartphone built in similar budget.\nThe software is breeze, actually awesome... Yes there are minor issue but MMX is releasing updates frequently to make it more smooth.\nOverall, if you ask me, go for it without any prejudice. Trust me you will not regret...",

            "First of all Congratulations to Micromax for its wonderful comeback with IN series phones.\n\nSome of the Pros and Cons after about 1 week usage\n\nPros\n1. Large Full HD screen. Works good in outdoor sunlight also.\n2. Massive 5000 mAh battery. Lasts more than a day with normal usage like call, msg, watching videos, surfing internet etc. I am not a heavy gamer so playing high end games is not my thing.\n3. Good Rear camera. 48 mp quad camera is actually good (U have to install updates for good photos).\n4. 4 gb Ram and Helio G85 processor is good for Lag free experience and also smooth running of FAU-G game.\n5. Near stock android without any bloatware and smooth UI.\n6. 18 W fast charging is good. Take less than or almost 2 hrs for 0 to 100% charge. Charger is included in box.\n7. Transparent decent back cover in box\n8. 2 years promised security and OS updates.\n9. Fingerprint sensor in the back works well.\n10. Speaker grill is at the bottom and is pretty loud and clear. (Don't expect bass at this price range. Sound is good but flat).\n\nCons.\n1. 16mp front camera is not good. It produces pretty bad images. Hope they fix it in their next update.\n2. Low light photo by back camera is also not upto the mark.\n3. Phone heats quite a bit after 15 mins of playing FAU-G though the heating was not high but cant ignore also.\n\nDidn't find any other issue. Will update after 1 month usage.\n\nVerdict: Apart from the front camera and low light photography issue the phone excels in all the other aspects be it lag free performance or long battery life. I would definitely recommend others to buy it.\nTip: Do fix a screen guard to prevent any damage or scratches on the screen in the long term.",
            "Must buy very good mobile value for money. And most important thing is this mobile is indian so guys plz support indian brand. Because it's better than all Chinese Mobile companies.",

            "Excellent mid range phone. Camera quality is good. Screen is so big. Your eyes wont get tired. Display settings are quite good. One and only issue is back button. Elders may find it confusing to use the back button. If they can provide fix for that nothing can beat note1. I would recommend it 99%. Just simply go for it. Look and feel is so good. It has premium look. I personally like white. By mistake I ordered green color phone. But I'm in love with my green phone. Happy that micromax came back.

            "Best phone ,Made in India,massive battery and camera performance,the only things where it lacks-1.dual apps like whatsapp,fb not supported,theme app which is inbuilt is not working, notification light which is common now a days is not present, otherwise this fon is a pure competitor for the brands like redmi,realme,oppo,etc",
            "I'm writing this review after 3 days of usage. I am using this as my secondary phone the other one is Samsung.\nThe Stock Like UI( Yes it's not stock but close to stock) is looking good however bugs are present here and there. Screen is good with good viewing angle and colour reproduction is also good. Battery backup is excellent and I'm not facing long charging time issue. Though the overall UI is clean and simple but the camera UI is made complicated and slow. Pictures from the main Camera(48MP) is good. But the other 2 cameras (Ultrawide and macro) are useless due to low resolution (5MP+2MP), selfie camera is okay. Micromax removed the pre-installed screen protector from new phones and included a case which is great but make sure you buy a scren protector from day 1. Call quality is good and internet speed is also good. Speaker is decent. Fingerprint reader is pretty fast. Micromax promised 2 years of security update, let's see if they can keep this promise. And last but not the least previously Micromax had a bad reputation in after sales service now it's high time that they don't repeat the same mistake and also expand their service centres in Tire-I cities.",

            "After a long gap Micromax was back and was happy to see a Indian brand in cluttered chinese dominating industry. However after using the mobile for couple of months, not happy with its charging speed and battery power. It takes time even for fast charging and the battery drops within 10 hours even with very low usage. Touch response was good during early days but now slowed down.",
            "I dont know why people select this phone under 10k. Its a great phone under 10k. Its really better than mi, realmi etc.. because its a stock android device.\nBut this phone will heat while charging. But when it reach 70-80% it will be cool. And others saying it will be fix with an update. I like it",

So, donot like stock android UI very much. - 5/10. However, installed poco launcher and it is working fine.\n\nCons:\nNo android 11 till date.\nMicromax should develop their own UI like MIUI.\nImage stabilization could be better.\n\nOverall:\nNice budget phone. Well comparable or better than its chinese peers.",

            "Have been using it for just over a month and loving it. The display is gorgeous and the battery last for 2 days at least. The best part is no ads and stock software. Micromax has already released 2 updates for this, and Android 11 is planned for April. So very happy with the updates. This is much better than the experience I have had with Mi, which sucks in case of updates. Go for it!",

The display is very beautiful, performance is beast it handles games very smoothly, sound output through headphone and speakers is also quite good the UI is also very clean it feels different than other phones at this price such as Realme , Redmi, vivo etc. There are little bit optimization issues such as framedrops while scrolling and app opening and closing but it doesn't bother me much. The camera needs some improvement in optimization but the 48 mp mode is impressive , the details are very sharp but the low resolution modes needs improvement, the front camera is also good . Overall a excellent value for money. I am completely satisfied with it.",

            "Must say that Micromax has indeed made a come back...With better features. Esp ,the stock android availability has made this ph even more user friendly. The touch is super crystal like feeling. Camera is gr8 at this price range. Ph size is a bit big but ,ok. Th finger print sensor is pretty good. Everything about this ph is good except for 2 things.. 1, doesn't have the volte option, face network problems, really feels like hell. . 2. The speaker, it's horrible, most of the time the sound comes as if the speaker has crashed. But there are time when the speaker works as if nothing is wrong. With speaker on call the same issues, too much harsh/coarse sound quality. Other than that gr8. Initially faced some heating issues but that has reduced to almost the normal. Hope Micromax will look into the issues and come up with more budget friendly phones. To add, this was my 1st purchase from Micromax. My attempt towards supporting INDIAN made products.\n\nPurchased and received this mobile on JULY 13,2021. Within 5months use ... It's a surprise that no one mentioned or maybe,,it's only me who's facing this particular problem: the phone switches off automatically during an incoming call as a result most of the times 'am unable to receive any call and at times even while making a call. Now even the customer care has sided my request to help me get the phone replaced as per the warranty on the brand. Unhappy...\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e Also the battery ....it's painful, at 34% charge, the phone shows low battery and signals for charge. Dnt know what to do.",

            "Good camera.. Best in class battery backup, very good performance.\nJust 1 thing i would like to mention that the phone heats up while charging. Temperature rises up to 50\u00b0 when you put on charge at 25% or low, untill it charges upto 60%.. After 60-65% it starts cooling down.\nAnd yes the 18W fast charging is not as fast as when compared to other phones in the same segment.\n\nOther than that.. It's a very good phone. I even do heavy gamming and it easily last for a whole day and above.\n\nGamming me bhi ekdum OP wala performance deta hai.\n\nOverall a good phone in this price segment. Loved it.",

            "Clearcut review:\n1. Heat up during changing. When you start charging it charge fast and mobile heat up terribly and reach 50-55 degree. After sometime it gear down charging and heating also reduce. But it do not overheat during use.\n\nUpdate: had manufacturing defect, problem solved by service center, and service is better then anyone. Now no heating issue.\n\n2. Can't do Offline video calling as it is stock android.\n\n3. It has 4 carrier aggregation, connect 4 band at al time. I tried on jio.\n\n4. Fingerprint sensor need improvement, sometimes it says doesn't match and next attempt open. It do not work if finger is wet. But face unlock fast. Fingerprint is not an issue to reject this phone, it's quite manageable.\n\n5. No such quality issue In built I have seen, I have White one and back pannel is also good, no such major issues like people says it can be pressed from back, yes but 1mm. It is not noticeable or you can't feel it while using.\n\n6. Display is awesome, I love the design and specially center punch hole. I did not want to buy nutch display it look old fashion. And had little budget constraint so I bought it.\n\n7. InFront camera is really good. Back camera is also good take good picture and good colour balance, It is after the latest camera update. In this range It has the best camera.\n\nConclusion: Heating during changing is a big issue. It will damage phone in long run. I am thinking of buying a 10w charger. Hence I am giving it 1star. If they fix it I will change my openion.\nUpdate: All issue got resolved, It's a must buy product.",

It was not working as expected, also there was problem with charging. The charging was very slow, it took 10 hours for it to fully charge from 10% to 100%. I thought it was because phone was new, I tried charing the second time, and still the problem was there.\n\nThen I asked for replacement but even after the replacement there was the same problem. The compass was telling wrong direction even after calibrating it for many hours. The charging issue was also present in the new phone. Unfortunately I had to ask for refund because I can't manage with slow charing and compass showing wrong direction in a brand new phone. I hope Micromax will fix it soon.

This is a bang and out of th ebox device. The display brightness is awesome even in outdoor conditions. The touch sensitivity is amazing. The fingerprint reader is heaven with the haptic feedback. It works magic in the price segment that the phone was released. Micromax should do much better in the coming years. Couple of negatives - could have provided the call recording option in the software itself; next is the display is a little bit bigger and my fingers are smaller. Worth every penny you pay for.

The shipped charger is so fast the phone gets really hot and that scares me. If you don't have a slow charger, use a laptop USB port to charge it, it will be slow enough.\n\nMost cool thing I saw here, maybe not unique to this phone I dont know, is that you can keep wifi AND hotspot on at the same time, so the phone can basically act as a relay for a wifi that may be too far away.

Before buying due to nice reviews. But when I compared with other mobile this is waste .\n\nMy experience:\n1)When I compared with 4000mah battery phone both are giving same back up time. Then what is the difference between 4000mah and 5000mah.\n\n2)The camera also not good. Saying that this is 48mp camera, when I compared with 13mp old mobile both are having clarity. This is not good\n\n3)Before buying in micromax official they said that this mobile will get regular updates for improving bugs and other issues. But from so many months only two updates came and the security patch date is May 2021.Then where is the protection for the mobile without security patch updates.\n\nNOTE:-\nThe 18w fast charging is bogus.6000mah battery phone is charging fastly with only 10w charger.But this is much worse.\n\nI advise to buy another company mobile if it still continues.",

Also no regular updates and security patch updates.\nAs per my opinion it's featureless phone and it's user interface is out dated\nGoogle dialer and google messaging is worst app and they are forcing other brands to use their app, atleast they must reach up to the level in terms of feature before forcing other brands to use their app.\nNo one is talking about this, also micromax is ignoring this.\nYou must consider other brands.",

It has a great backup. For normal usage (excluding heavy gaming) it lasts more than 12 hours. The rear camera is better but needs more updates. But the selfie camera needs updates much more than the rear one. The picture quality of the front camera is better when beauty mode is enabled but without it the camera has dull performance. Other minor bugs and tiny stutters that are very unnoticeable and can be ignored while using apps and other functions of the phone. I hope with new updates the Micromax India adds much more new features with regular updates for making our experience more smooth and easier. Thank you Flipkart for your delivery in 2 days.

No customized apps so that you become lazier day by day\nOne needs to download apps for one touch off, data speed, etc. Also sim swapping is difficult.\n\n.........\nThere are 3 dots near in logo which appears after switching the phone. That's not a pixel death. Tempered glasses available in market though not the shockproof back cases. (Company supplied case is adequate)\n\nIf we support Indian companies for about 5 years then all the components might be manufactured here only. What really disappointing is people only chant vocal for local, display psuedo-digital patriotism \ud83e\udd2d and buy cheap Chinese goods.\n\nTry to delete your account in those cheeni phones which contain many sensitive information about you and see how difficult it is to come out.

            "Nice phone",
            "In note 1 was the product for me at a budget range. Is this the best budget phone at 10k - 15k range? may be not, it is not the only one at its segment. But is it the best value for money? certainly yes, specially the 4gb, 64gb variant. There were some issues with quality control when the model was released. But the developers kept there promise. My handset felt tight and durable, finish was smooth and it came with a nice transparent back cover. The phone performance wise felt smooth and snappy. Often reviewer said the camera was not optimized. However, after use I found the camera quality to be very realistic and it flaws in my photography subject does not vanish away post processing like some other device on the market(you know which one I am talking about). The Stock android is a bonus and I like my hand set clean.Speaker sound quality was loud and ok if not great. The dual sim cum memory slot and headphone jack was a life saver. Now lets come to the flaws. The HDR and night mode photo post processing will take few milliseconds or seconds extra, not that it is noticeable but if one is very particular about those things they should know. Battery charging for me was fast enough and it took 1:30 hours to 1:45 hours to charge from 41% to 100%. Since I charge my phone at night post my office it is okay enough for me. However, battery drain I found is a bit much as after 5 - 6 hours of on and off usage (some you tube vids, some mails, some music playing on Bluetooth music system was done not continuously but after several breaks) it lost 12% of battery. I personally think the drain is a bit higher than its competitors (however at a medium usage it should still last a day or near day and be charged when the user is at sleep or something). Having said that these are software optimization issues and the battery drain, HDR, Night mode photo processing could be addressed with updates.\nAll in all Micromax in Note 1 try to give its consumer taste of every thing (a good gaming processor, stock android/snappy experience, realistic photo quality, dual sim/memory slot and 3.5 jack and a good loud speaker to blast your favorite song on the go) while not being the king of only one or two aspect(s) at the price range of merely 11000 rs. Frankly this is for me Asus max pro series on steroids and Asus max pro series was a beast and cost lesser than its competitors. This is one hell of a value for money phone and even if you are planning to go for 5g within coming 1.5 to 2 years but need one 4g phone now, pocket pinch and value concerned, this one 4g phone you wont regret as it is cheaper than its competitors and gives the ability to do every handset oriented task in a pretty satisfactory manner.\nIf how developers responded to quality control, can respond to the software optimization in a same way (which they have already promised for 2 coming rears, another), I will gladly look forward to Micromax's desi flagship 5G edition too.",

There's been minor flaws in the software patches, but it can easily be neglected, plus I've got one software update immediately afterwards.

            "I am writing the review after 1 day of usage. The phone is pretty sturdy in its design and performance.\nThere are some really cool features, the best one is having the latest android version and this phone is free from those apps which you dont use any time. Ad free and app free phone on which you install what you like, the phone is super fast in processing, handles multiple apps at the same time.\nI dont know about other comments that I saw but I feel the camera quality is pretty good wrt amount that you paid for the phone. 12.5 K with 128 GB memory and camera 48MP camera...What more do you want. The color on the back is awesome.\nFirst impression is very satisfactory and I am happy to be part of the Atmanirbhar where an Indian company is competing with the alike brands but the cost is very reasonable and more secured as compared to the chinese brands which no one in the world relies on. On the other hand the charger is a plus plus which no company these days provide.\nThe one most important thing that I should mention here is its SAR is below 1 which is the best among the similar feature phones in the market. No one tells you about it but it is something the people should always look when buying a smartphone. It is radiation that is emitted from phone. Samsung is best phone to buy wrt this parameter and I see Micromax is not that bad either unlike the chinese brands which have high SAR's.",

For 1.5 hrs of charge it's runs for 2 days in normal usage of data and calls. Liked VoLTE + VOWIFI feature. Soon, I'll put video of my review.

And i must say micromax is doing fabulous job here where they are trying to provide asuch as they can and also they have provided a great competition to other brands but i have highly satisfied with the phone... Thank you micromax \ud83e\udd18\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udc4d\nJust provide us with the cover of this phone please its hard to find the accurate one as it is not available in the market",

            "Let us divide this review in pros and cons.\nPros:\n1. Awesome camera : I have used redmi note 9 for a few weeks so I know its camera performance which is just above average and for some reason I was expecting less from micromax, but when I checked its camera, it was really impressive considering the pricing of the phone. It shoots good quality photos with impressive details during daylight but it struggles at night when there is absence of light. The front camera is good and shoots some nice photos.\n2. Bigger battery : The 5000 mAh battery will last upto 18-20 hrs under normal usage, upto 11 hrs with always screen on option and about 7 hrs while playing games like COD, freefire, etc. It does not heat while playing heavy games like COD\n3. Screen : I personally like the 6.67 inch massive screen the screen is not overly saturated or blue tinted and I must tell you micromax has used some really good panels on their smartphones. The is responsive and produce some accurate colours.\n4. Clean UI : Its pretty rare to see a bloatware free phone in this price segment (except for Nokia). Micromax has advertised it as pure android but i must tell you that it is not really pure android, they have added some features like intelligent gaming and customized icons senn in quick settings bar.\n5. Speakers : In note 1 ships with a single loud speaker which is quite loud and impressive to hear songs and play games.\n\nCons:\n1. Built quality : The phone's back panel is made up of some sort of poly carbonated plastic, side buttons are also made up of plastic and is poorly attached to the plastic main frame. They are loosely attached and can fell from the phone in future. Overall I was not impressed with the overall build quality. Micromax should check on this issue in their upcoming devices. Overall I will give 3/5 for built quality.\n2. Operating system : Micromax should really look into their android based OS. While using I noticed some lag while switching between apps, the camera app's UI is so simple and they have some outdated Gallery app installed in the phone. When the phone is switched to light theme instead of Dark theme, for some reason gallery app still remains in the dark themed background, Also if you enabled the three finger screenshot gesture you cannot use the phone using three fingers or more and if used (like when playing games) the whole screen freezes. Overall they are all minor problems and can be fixed by rolling out an update.\n\nOverall, I must say that Micromax is off to a good start and now I am willing to see that they really work on the promised 2 years of software updates and security patches. Really hoping that Micromax will Dominate the Budget and Mid range smartphone market.",
