            "Hi All,\n\nI got this phone from Flipkart on 1st Feb 2022 that is 9 days ago. So I will post my honest reviews on this. I have not tested or played games in it as I play games in my other phone one plus 7T.\n\nBut in other things, here are below Good things :-\n\n1) Good crisp display with AMOLED Full HD display.\n2) Battery backup is excellent. Screen on time ranging from 10 hrs to 11 hrs SOT (Note that I don't play games on this device).\n3) Charging speed is ok (33W fast charger). Phone will charge from 0 to 100 % in about 75 mins time.\n4) Though it doesn't have stereo speakers but still the sound quality while listening music or watching videos is excellent on this phone both via speakers and earphones and also via bluetooth earphones.\n5) Software experience is quite clean with no ADS or Bloatwares. Moto UI is always clean with zero ads.\n6) Call quality is also excellent both via speaker or earphones. Mic works good while on calls.\n7) Processor is good. SD 695 chipset which is equivalent to Dimensity 900 or equal to SD 765.\n\nNow some things which I think is not good :-\n\n1) Though the display is AMOLED Full HD but screen refresh rate is only 60Hz. It should have been atleast 90Hz.\n2) Camera could have been better though I have not tested camera much.\n3) No stereo speakers in 19K phone.\n4) Though software is clean with no ADS but Motorola has not confirmed how many major Android update and security updates it will get. (Though Android 12 is guaranteed).\n\nNOTE :- Here were my honest reviews above. If you have any questions you can reach out to me.\n\nThanks,\nRitesh",
            "The phone is light, comfortable to hold and quite thin. What stands out is the display. The colors are accurate which makes for a nice viewing experience. So far the processor seems snappy and I haven't experienced any lag. The audio and the front facing camera is decent but the main camera is nothing to boast about. The pictures taken are out of focus and seem to lack color. The fingerprint reader is also unresponsive at times, but it doesn't take away from the overall experience of the phone.\n\nIf you have a previous generation Moto g phone, you aren't missing much and I wouldn't suggest upgrading to this.\n\nGet the g71 if you have a much older phone (<2017) and want a stock android experience. But there are cheaper options out there that offer similar features at a lower price.\n\nNote: The phone does not come with earphones.",

Also the 2 MP macro camera is useless, it shouldn't be there.\n\nIf you are looking for a phone with great camera, then you would be disappointed, other than that its a great phone",
            "Awesome phone!! Motorola is a trusted brand. My previous Moto g5 plus I have used for 4.5 yrs \ud83d\ude0d super impressed with g71 and its intelligent features. Superb display, works buttery smooth... Performance is simply ace! I don't know why people complain about the camera, I found it excellent. Well, I am not very selfie obsessed and do not post pics on social media but do use the camera sometimes and found it awesome! Thank you Flipkart and thank you Moto \ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18",
            "From 10 days of usage, I can confidently say performance of the phone on this price bracket is amazing, snapdragon 695 is looking a good prospect in power, efficiency and RAM management. Though I am not a gamer to explore its limits. 1.5 days of damn sure battery life for the general user though if you have 1 hr of video conference. It is a polycarbonate built but still it was really put together well. Selling points of this phone would be excellent Amoled screen stock android, no advertisement, Lenovo Thinksheild protection and Motorola has promised to give 2 yr updates and hope they stand by what they say. Only gripe would be Motorola could have gone with some sort of Gorilla protection for the display.\n\nOverall if you are looking for a steady performer with great efficiency, security, Amoled screen, stock Android and your budget is around 20k, this is the phone for you!",
            "Totally genuine review after 2weeks of use.\n\nThe phone seems comfortable to use in below aspects as given in its description:\n1. Camera is actually good, it process the image post click for better images.\n2. The images when taken efficiently comes out well but on walking or movement they get blurred.\n3. No blot ware as it's near stock Android.\n4. 5G can't be tested soon but seems comfortable connecting the wifi 5g band that's normally provided these days.\n5. The features and customisation available for phone is quite good.\n6. Performance is good so far.\n7. Display and colour contrast looks good and classy neither too bright to eyes nor too dull. Balanced well to give a decent clean look.\n8. Dolby Atmos is the only speaker feature but could improve with 2 speakers.\n\nLacking below things :\n\n1. No magnetic compass app.\n2. Call recording always occured with announcement, can't disable announcement.\n3.Earphones and screen guard were mentioned in box details here, but it's not available in the box.\n4.Charging speed was mentioned as 33w but the battery drains faster and charges slowly. Not upto mark.\n5. No installed notepad app, music, recording and album app. It uses default Google photos app.\n\nWorth buying as the processor and display, cam pixels, performance, cost, connecting bands and sound quality with near stock Android. Most of the concerns can be fixed installing apps manually if needed except charging... But, on moderate rate of use charging stays for entire day. So can compromise on that then you can go for it.",
            "I have been using the Moto G71 5G for more than a month now(from 28th Jan).\nThe Display is superb \ud83d\ude0d, Good Battery life too.. charging is also fast.\nThe camera \ud83d\udcf8 was not I expected. It's a descent camera no dout about it. It gives social media ready pics, little colour boost, skin smoothening...etc. the people who use extra filters and apps for that will definitely love this, I don't like that type of photos, I like the natural photography, natural colours and my face as it is. Now I am using a google camera port and I am getting great photos from it... But my wife will still prefer the Moto camera \ud83d\ude09.\nEverything is super smooth, no complaints at all.\nThe stock Android experience is awesome, but still running on Android 11 (13/03/2022)\nThe design, I don't liked it at first but now it is growing on me.\nFingerprint sensor is on the back, no problem there easily reachable. And that can be use to pull down notification tray. But no other gesture like screen off, which was seen in earlier Moro phones. Manufacturers should give more usability when they go with back sensors.\nMotorola should added a Compass sensor to it, didn't faced any issues in Google Map.",
            "An excellent phone in all aspects.\nCharging amazingly fast.the battery held the charge for full two days with charge still to go until the next morning. With two sims on and data on and usage.i was using a xiomi 10 which lasts not so long.\nSmooth to use\nQuality and build excellent.\nSome gesture features are nice and handy.for ex shake for light on etc etc.\nSound clarity dolby atmos is very good and loud and rich.\nGps is quick to lock and seemed very accurate,10t redmi took a longer time and was many times inaccurate.\ni think it has all the good things and is a no nonsense phone.\nCons: it does not have a magnetometer which means it will not display compass readings.no effect on GPS though.\nMotorola is a trusted brand and the phone,at the price that it is being offered,is a worthy buy.",
            "Pros:\nBattery and fast charging\nAmoled display\nFast Snapdragon 695 chipset\nLight weight\nClean stock Android\nBack camera 50mp and selfie camera good. 4/5.\n\nCons:\nOther cameras decent not worth in 19k phone\nShould have at least 90hz display\n4k recording support not there",
            "Its a good phone overall, am liking the usage.\n\nPerformance is good, 695 can handle a lot, no heating even after extended use\n\nCamera is decent for selfie and close up shots but lacks detail in long shots..that has to improve, camera ui has to improve\n\nBattery is excellent\n\nCall quality, wifi, network reception excellent\n\nDisplay is good quality, a 90hz display would have made it outstanding.\n\nStock ui is such i pleasant usage",
            "Motorola G71 5G is a amazing phone at this price point \ud83e\udd70\ud83c\udf1f\nDisplay- Quality is amazing but if company give 90hz Or 120hz so it's almost fabulous but it's ok at price point.\nBattery- Battery performance is also amazing almost it give me 1 day battery backup and 33 watt charger is very fast for charging it's take 55 to 60 minutes for full charge.\nCamera- camera of this phone is not good at this price point camera is ok camera need a software update to fix the exposure issue in camera not good\ud83d\ude21.\nPerformance- Performance of this phone is amazing with 695G processor it's very fast for day to day usage performance is very good I like it.\nConnectivity- i use a jio sim i did not get proper tower in the phone some time give 2 or 3 idle in the tower I am very disappointed with that because previous I use redmi note 6 pro it gives always full network but in this I facing this issue.\nConclusion- It's very good phone for daily usage but think about this point of my usage.",
            "Those who want the best performance for faster mobile with many apps this mobile is good.\nBattery life is excellent.\nMobile is lighter to handle.\nToo good when it comes to sound.\nI am happy with performance.\nCamera is OK but who want their selfi and want to post as a frame then also it is good but for the zoomed pics it get scattered.\nI will rate 4.5star overall.",
            "Everything is just top notch except the camera. Camera is not bad but average and I knew it. Motorolla never focused on camera. My priority was not camera , so it doesn't bother me. Otherwise if you want a phone with clean stock Android, good display, smooth touch ,fast, good battery, decent processor and of course under 20000, please go for it.",
            "Writing the review after 1 week of usage.\nI was follower of redmi phones however redmi works fine initially but its not that durable. Hope moto is a good choice.\n\nPros:\nBattery backup is great and works for atleast 1.5 days with heavy usage.\nTurbo charging, take only 1.5 hrs to charge 100%\nPerformance is great and processor is also great.\n\nI am not a camera addict so the phone provides average quality which is fine with me. However, if you have camera preference then you can search some other handset.\n\nDisplay is good!!\n\nLight weighted.\n\nHaven't found any cons yet, I will edit the review if i come across any con.",
            "Pros:\nLight weight: Sleek one, pretty compact due to 6.4inch\nDisplay: Amoled , awesome colour reproduction.\nGreat performance: Very smooth n fast response\nQuick charge: Takes less than an hour for full charge\nBigger battery: Easily 1.5 day for a rough usage too\nCamera : pretty decent\nNo bloatware, Moto gestures.\n\nCons:\nNo SdCard slot\nBut not a major one as 128Gb internal storage is enough for me.\n\nFinally feel happy with Moto again. Just go for it.",
            "Great overall package for the price. Gifted it to my sister and she loved it... Hope moto keeps their word and give timely updates too...",
            "Excellent phone with great performance, feels feather light on hand. Great display can't tell about the screen refresh rate I think it's 60Hz with sharp images, sound from speaker is decent enough not so loud but good and clear sound. Camera is the only thing I found to complaint about videos taken by camera is good but front camera need to be improved I would give 3.5/5 for it camera performance only hope they improve it in future software updates. Call quality is superb, with no heating issue. Phone is capable of handling all kind of gaming activities(only played Asphalt 9,COD). Charging is fast overall a extremely good value for money. Deserve a 5\u2605 rating.",
            "Buy recommendation only after you go through the brief review given.\n\nBest battery, above avg camera, processor is good, little confused with processor numbering though.\n\nThe phone comes with stock android so hardly any adds, bugs or spam applications. Being a moto user for four years, little new to stock android so sometimes I miss fancy interfaces of poco.\n\nDidn't understand moto choice of not providing compass sensor in 18k phone, that's the only major drawback I must say. You definitely will face problem with navigation sometimes as the map has to run on only GPS signal.

This device gave me a battery life of 25.5 hrs from 100% to 21%. A decent camera and its biggest usp software is brilliant. After using MIUI for 3 years the moto MyUx feels light and fast to use and not adds nothing. The UI is customisable and hence give a personalized experience. Just waiting for Android 12 update in the phone.\nOnly thing I miss is expandable memory, though 128gb is enough but still expandable would have mad it a wonderful phone, also 60 hz display. For me 60Hz is fine but at this price we see phones with 90Hz. Overall this an amazing phone that I can suggest to anyone.",

Battery last 1-1.5 days for moderate usage of social media calling and surfing.\nOnly shortcoming is the absence of magnetic sensor which makes phone lack on compass based apps.\nBuild is plastic but looks good and low weight and 6.4 inch display make it handy mobile.\nOverall an allrounder phone ideal for kids and elders.",

It's also having Dolby Atmos support.\nClean Stock Android experience.\n13 bands of 5G (No Gimmick)\nCons:\nCamera is average. It boosts the colors and the blurring effect is not calibrated properly. In good lighting conditions the photos come out really good.\nNo higher refresh rate ( this might bother some people who have used a higher refresh rate device before,otherwise you won't notice it. There are no lags or jitters in day to day operations!)\nNo SD Card slot\nThere is no inbuilt gallery or app lock feature (this might bother some people migrating to stock Android from other UI )\nBut definitely this provides a good value for money and is definitely one of the best phones in this price segment. If you are looking for a camera centric phone then you can go for Redmi Note 10 series. Otherwise this is a great phone to have in this price segment.",

Moto is never known for good camera, but on seeing the shots, I think they've been listening to feedback.\n\nThe spec sheets are good as they are, the one major con would be the lack of a compass sensor. While I'm not someone who frequently uses the phone for navigation, I can appreciate the need for a compass.

I really want to say that mobile phone companies (especially Android os platform) is pushing us to pay huge amount of money for same technology of 5 years back. No improvement in processing speed and security and privacy of the customer. We Indians are being fooled by them as we are going crazy for Megapixel & 4;5;6 cameras and useless charging battery speed or huge batteries. We miss main focus on the processor,GPU,display,durability(at least should be 3 years) & OS improvement... Android upgrade is all hipe ... The basic thing is Android security patch which Android denies to provide after 18 months ... Basically pushing us to buy new phone.\nFinal verdict - Indian companies need to develop better phones and Indian own OS or atleast a better UI.",

It takes an hour to fully charge itself using the 33 Watt charger provided with. I do not play games in mobile. In normal use with 18 hours of all time Internet access it takes for me 2 days to drain out the battery after a full charge. Finger print sensor and face detection quality is very good compared to other company phones except Apple. Having 5000mah battery it is still light weight. No unnecessary boult wares or ads. Having said these pros, the concern area is the camera. The back primery camera is fine, the macro camera has various issues and the front camera quality is not as good as expected.\n\nOverall if one is looking for a phone with quality performance, display, battery life and ease of use in a moderate budget and not because of camera quality then without any doubt go for it.",

            "The best thing which I like the most is its performance... extremely superb ..no lag while playing bgmi and cod...all were saying that the display is not good but it is nice irrespective of 60 hz panel.overall a very nice phone and the camera is also killer...must consider this while buying in this price segment.",
            "Superb Display.\nExcellent performer.\nBattery lasts longer than expected.\nCharging time is approximately 1hr.\nBattery charging optimisation is there for the better health of the battery in long run.\nCamera is the only issue.Moto should work on this segment.\nNo connectivity issue.\nSpeaker is quite loud with Dolby Atmos support.\nOverall best all rounder in this price segment.",

Its an all-round mobile and good for daily use.\nThe display, camera, battery are all very good.\nThis is very good product from Motorola.
