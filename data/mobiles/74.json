            "I am using this device as my secondary device and I am quite happy with the performance, but facing a little laggy despite having 80% free storage and 4GB RAM. Good things are a clean user interface, no ads, no bloatware, and battery backup also good. I don't use the camera that much as I mentioned it's not my primary but typing hepatic feelings is too good like a flagship. Considering the price point it's a very good device. I bought this in exchange three years old Nokia1 so it's felt very little for me.",
            "PRO: Good battery, great display in the segment, phone feels good in hand, stock and clean android 10 no bloatware, moto gestures are awesome, buy it if you want good budget phone and you're more into multimedia\n\nCONS: camera quality below average, Front camera is bad, don't buy if you're more into photography",

I don't use the camera that much as I mentioned it's not my primary but typing hepatic feelings is too good like a flagship. Considering the price point it's a very good device. I bought this in exchange three years old Nokia1 so it's felt very little for me.",

            "Regarding it's brand value , this phone justified it's price . But this phone has major issues like - (1) very low bright display , (2) below average picture quality & (3) low powered MTK Helio G25 Chipset which is Rebranded version of Helio P22 . Overall , if you are looking for long battery usage and normal social media usage , it is one of the best option for you . Don't buy it if you expecting for lag-less gaming experience or superb camera quality .",

Stock Android (hence best option for elderly ppl who cannot handle the annoying ads of Chinese Mobiles)\n\nNegatives\n1. Display is okay\n2. Phone is too big (instead of such a big display they should provide better processor for the price)\n3. Selfie camera is just okay\n4. Despite being Moto mobile there are no Moto gestures\n5. No mention about android update",

            "Bought this for my dad. He liked the phone and the colour. It's not handy due to bigger screen size. The screen resolution is not the best as the ppi isn't that great. Performance is way too average but can't expect much though for the pricing. The camera could have been better. If using as a secondary phone can go for it as it has got good battery backup.",

My observations after using it are as following:\n\n1. Battery: It can't get any better than this. The 5000mAh battery lasts much longer than usual phones. I used the phone continuously on moderate level for 2 days and still the battery left was around 20 percent.\n\n2.

            "Good phone in a pocket friendly budget. Had there been two sim slots and a memory slot, would have rated 5 stars. As of now phone is working great with both sims in use and for memory the 64 GB inbuilt memory is proving sufficient till now.",
            "Average phone in this Segment. Camera quality is not so good but battery life is very good. Display is average and you will dissapoint in high sunlight.You stage will do normal works but at a stage of high works it will lags.",
            "I purchased this mobile on 7th May 2021 after a lot of thorough research depending upon my usage and I am really astonished to see the performance.\nWell, for me Camera is not much of an importance but the quality of image captured during dark hours are not so good but manageable. The 4 and 64 gb variant is very smooth. No bloat wares and I am loving it. One will get 49-50 gb internal memory initially. Battery takes 2hours to charge from 0-100 which I feel is decent because the backup is pretty good due to its 5000 mah battery which takes 1.5 days for me to drain. My usage is watching 7-8 hours of online video throughout the day and playing games occasionally.\nComing to games, it can play COD but in low settings but I would defer not to play huge games because of its processor. It will run smoothly initially but the performance of the phone will detoriate massively.\nI got a plastic back cover attached with this phone in the box. No Tempered received. RAM management is very good if compared with the Redmi phones in 10k budget range. Speaker is awesome.\nOne thing which I did not realised since I was a Redmi user before this is that the motorola phones does not come with an inbuilt file manager and gallery folder unlike other brands. So that needs to be installed.",
            "I bought this phone on 10th March 2021 from Flipkart. The delivery was very fast and hassle free. Now about the phone, The blue colour which I ordered was nice. Good thing is that this phone is water resistant. The phone is a bit heavy and feels bulky. The phone has got good performance, thanks to 4GB of RAM, 64 GB internal storage and near stock android software with minimal bloatware running on December security patch, inspite of running on an entry level processor. The software updates are not very quick like the android one phones from Nokia. The battery back up seems to be good. Adaptive brightness calibration doesn't seem correct, and brightness of the screen is always on the higher side. Both cameras are just average and camera interface is not very easy to understand. Overall a nice phone for this price range with a few short comings.",
            "Worth the Money. In the Price range, It is the best. Camera suffers a bit during night but in day light it's fine. Good battery lasts more than a day for average usage. Performance is more than good (better). But we may able to see some lags for heavy usage as g25 is entry level processor. In normal usage, Not worries at all.\nNear Stock Android is best and After Sales Support of Motorola is Really Good. This review is after using this for nearly 2months. Go for it If your budget is below 9k.",

In fact, couldn't find a smartphone in the right budget with the right size and required configuration. Screen is ok - not excellent - but good enough for intended use. Audio quality is good.

So decided to go with budget phone for the time. But this phone amazed me with its quality. As it has loud volume so good to hear songs on the phone and it has 5000 mah battery which gives you backup for the day easily only flaws is 10 watt charger for many user to charge such a large battery. But for me it's not an issue. Love this phone also flipkart service",

            "Bought the phone for my wife who was using a Asus earlier. It is large & heavy & OK for ladies who carry the phone in their purse / bag. To carry in trouser pocket or in hand will take some getting used to.\n\nIt performs well for the price. Screen resolution is just OK. However the large display makes viewing videos very comfortable. The battery life is really good needs charging only once a day for 4 - 5 hours screen time.\n\nThe chip is not the fastest but most apps load & function without any problem. Streaming services including Zoom is quite good without any lag / buffering.\n\nPhotos are just decent nothing great. A funny thing which happened a couple of times is the screen goes blank & Chinese characters appear on it. The phone continues in this mode for a couple of minutes then it boots again.\n\nOverall a decent phone at a budget price. Don't have high expectations, you will not be disappointed.",

I have searches a lots of smartphone in recent days and selected this Moto e7 power though it is having a below than average processor but overall performance and my requirements meets this moto e7 power.\nMy requirements was,\n1.Simple phone with stock android.\n2.Clean UI experience with no blow blotware apps.\n3.Strong built quality.\n4.I have to gift this phone to one of my family member who is a elder person and do not play heavy games or do multitasking.\n5.my past experience with moto was good at all.\n6.Price is in budget I got this in 8k that is satisfactory.\nI find all of these in this smartphone and one thing more each and every phone has its limitations and clause, some phones has something and other has something else. So go with your requirements and select a decent phone.",

Even the lava will win the competition.\n\nDisplay- The touch sensor & display graphic is a big headache.\nI mean it's Motorola not some other Chinese brand, obviously expected better.\n\nBattery - No complaint.\n\nOther than all this, if you have another good phone & you are looking for second phone just for conversation thing or you have to give the phone to elders. This is your phone.\n\nOverall rating 3/5.",

Sound from person speaking other side is clear and loud even on crowded places.\n- Good network reception.\n- Volte works for Vodafone-Idea or Airtel thru home Wifi. Jio works fine.\n- A plastic transparent protective cover comes bundled. So you save Rs.150 ;-)\n- Big screen of 6.5 inch.\n- MS-Teams works good and built in speaker is adequately loud and no external speakers should be needed to take online classes (My personal opinion).\n- C type charger.\n- Built in Wifi is very efficient. Its not choppy from the place where my old phones become very prone to disconnection.\n- Edges are not rounded so a screen guard can stick happily.\n- Feels sturdy.\n- Flipkart delivery was awesome. Also my old phone exchange was seamless with the delivery person.\n- The Box says its made in India (not sure how true it is...looking at the low cost)\n\nCONS (none of them are show stopper though...)\n- Camera is very basic.\n- Little disappointed with the display brightness. Its little on a dull side.\n- Phone is a little heavy and thick as it does have a big battery, so acceptable.\n- The built in flash light is not so bright when I compare it with couple of other smartphones we have.\n- Battery takes quite long time to recharge as the charger is of less capacity.",
