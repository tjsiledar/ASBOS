            "According to this budget , this phone is fabulous.\nAs in this budget we are getting 4 GB RAM and 128 GB internal memory which is quite good combination where other phones are giving 64 GB as their internal storage. Not only this we are getting also Exynos 850 processor which is a very good power efficient processor and 90Hz refresh rate which makes the phone very fast. And the camera quality is really good, its focus technology is really great. And SAMSUNG is really a very good brand as well as very popular all over the world. And this Phone is MADE IN INDIA !!!\n\nDon't hesitate to buy this !!",
            "The phone looks great in appearance. Fully black tinted glass pops out its nex gen looks. See Green gives compliment with whole black display. Precisely it is teal color not sea green. Touch (scroll up and down or sideways) is very smooth. Battery lasted from 24 Hours on 50% on mediocre use. Wi Fi connects fast and working nicely.\n\nNow with cons (there are multiple)\nDisplay is very very bad. It is smoky white rather than bright white. Colors are very dull.\nThere is over brightness on display specially when you play the video and compare it side by side.\nColor correction is uneven. Yellow becomes pale yellow, Orange becomes dark yellow. Red becomes Maroon, Blue becomes Indigo and so on when compared with other phone side by side video. Overly faded colors.\nI have 5 year old Mi Note 4 and this Samsung F12 lags far behind in terms of display quality.\nI tried playing 2k video, and guess what file not supported then I used MX player, video played but was lagging too much such as 10 or 15 FPS. My Note 4 plays smoothly on default player.\nCamera is pretty average, there is nothing Feb in it. May be because of smoky white display.\nTouch (Tap) response is slow, takes time to open any app even settings.\nPresently battery plugged in 60% charged and 1 hour 15 minutes remaining.\n\nFor me it is a BIG no. I would rather stick to my old phone.\nCan't Believe Samsung was beaten by Redmi. China wins the round over South Korea for 5 years.\n\nChanged ratings to 1 because Flipkart denied of any replacement or refund request very rudely.",
            "Using the phone for the last 13 days.\n\n\u2022The best thing about the phone is the battery. The amazing battery lasts for about 30 hours in one full-charge for me.\n\n\u2022I am not a gamer. Keeping that in mind, the performance of the phone is quite good.\n\n\u2022The back-camera is also good but could have been much better for 48-MP. The front camera is also not bad. The macro lens is very good for a 2-MP lens.\n\n\u2022 Overall, I love this phone. No complains.",
            "Review after 3 month of use:\n\n1)Camera and battery backup are upto the mark...4/5\n2)Screen or display is bit disappointed as resolution not that good .but its ok for this price tag...3/5\n3) Performance is good if you are using genral purpose.but not that good or smooth for playing high resolution games like COD or PUBg.3/5\n4)it definitely a value for money and more important it is not Chinese . If Samsung improve and more features in One UI .also it has samsung ads or bloatware .4/5",
            "Sumsung love | f12 camera quality is very good | is sumsung branding is very super #sumsung f12 is full hd display | proccer is fast speed | smooth display 90hz | best quality speaker | super sound quality | mobile size is very good---thanks flipkart (love you sumsung f12) battery backup is very best. flipkart online shopping is very good-----thanks flipkart",
            "Really loved the build quality.........smudgeproof \ud83d\ude0d\nDisplay is quite bright what I expected it got more brightness. Battery is huge 6000mAh & u can use it for 1 - 1.5days straight without any issue also u can get 2days if u r a light user.\nCamera is also the best as always........Thanks @Samsungindia for that.\nRegarding the performance I would like to say..........it's Much power efficient rather than powerful one.\nIn short,It's a value for money device from SAMSUNG.",
            "The camera optimization is very poor. The 48Mp's photo looks like captured from 2Mp camera and the macro shot is nightmate. But yaa seamless experience as compared to Xiaomi or any other Chinese phones as there are no ads and the UI is light and it feels very fast in using. The battery is a plus point for this phone. I personally liked the UI as compared to MIUI with no bloatwares and ads popping out in middle of the work which is in the case of MIUI",
            "It's a good midranger. Apt for someone looking for a second phone or for your parents or kids. Feels solid. Looks decent. 90hz refresh is a plus. The camera perform well enough. I personally love One UI so definitely a good buy. The drop notch looks a bit dated but other than that over-all it's okay.",
            "This mobile f12 is absolute value for money with a excellent battery back up uptown 5 days but it is very thick and the display of this is not as much better but satisfying and the front camera is also not good but overall performance of this mobile is excellent in this price range.so if you are think of buying it then your choice is correct.",
            "*Display is great.... No such phone can provide this type of display like galaxy F12 in this range...\n\n*Battery is mind blowing.... Even after heavy usage.. it gave a backup upto 2 days ...\n\n*Performance is ok.... For normal use no such problems.... But heavy gaming is not mandatory...\n\n*Camera is also good... Shutter is a bit low but you cam click some outstanding pictures from the back camera.... But the selfie camera is below average.... Need to improve a lot...\n\nOverall this is a great phone for this price segment.... And you can definitely buy if you are student... And also can buy it for your parents..",
            "Overall good camera and battery phone in this price.\nCamera quality is very good.\nBattery also good last upto 2 days.\nPerformance good like any other samsung mobile.\nSound quality is very good.\n\nPhone is little bit heavy due to 6000mAh battery.\nBack panel looks outdated.\n\nOverall good phone in this budget range.",
            "Best clean budget phone.\nIf you need a clean. And good simple degine working performance.\nIt's best.\nAnd if you need best of the best photo, then plz buy a DSLR not a phone.",
            "Low light camera is not good , selfie is average but looking wise it's a good product .\nPerformance is good with average gaming\nBattery pick up also good\n\nOverall value for money",
            "It is very very nice and it's is Battery preformance is awesome it can for 3days and it performance of the chip inside super more faster .camera also good .",
            "Really amazing \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\ude0dproduct I'm totally satisfied with it if anyone is willing to purchase a new phone I will recommend you to purchase I have also ordered another same product for my mother it's really nice u can rely on it value for money \ud83d\udcb0",
            "it's not very good but battery is good processor is not very good so if we have to do gaming then it is not better for us",
            "Best mid range mobile from samsung , back camera is good but front camera is avarage. Performance is good although good phone in this price range.",
            "I'm writing this review after 4 days of using this phone. According to the price this phone is excellent. Battery life is amazing. Lasts about 2 days after charging. Display is good. Sound quality is not that great but its okay. There are some amazing advance features. A bit heavy though. Overall this is an amazing phone in this budget.",
            "Recently bought samsung m21 for father which had oled screen so expected f12 to be better than that but turned out to be far less than m21 for almost same price. Poor screen color, poor camera, wifi also only 2.4 gz and not 5 gz. One good camera would have been sufficient instead of 4 bad cameras. Pics captured look like artificially painted. Worst boot time. Looks great only from outside, but internal are strip down like anything. Samsung should stop fooling people.",
            "Camera is not so good . Battery is not like 6000 mah . Only phone look is good .",
            "It is a good quality product and it is better then my expectations.......\nIt's a cool phone.\nAs it's a med range phone..",
            "Very nice product according to price. delivered next day after booking. Camera, battery, display good. Every one may buy with out any doubts. I recommend it to Samsung lovers. LOVELY MOBILE.",
            "Great Product , If You want to buy a new branded phone and you have only a less amount in your hand , then no problem just buy this and use its fantastic. I Bought a Black one , that's great in real but not good in photos...",
            "Nice\nPhone in samsung budget series I love samsung products quality , after sale service , the support, security updates all in all great company ....",
            "Good features and camera quality is good and powerful battery and nice and auto call recorder option is also available if don't want auto call recorder option manual call recorder option is also available but the problem is we should have click tow time to open any thing other good phone value of money and most recommended",
            "Superb Phone......\n\nDon't look at the negative comments if you are not a heavy gamer (Pubg, Call of Duty, etc.). Light gaming like Subway Surfers, Temple Run runs very smoothly in this phone.\n\nPros:\n1. Big Display (6.5 inch). Brightness and display quality is also good. 90hz display is also an advantage\n2. Big Battery (6000 mAh). It gives 1 day battery backup after heavy usage and it may be used for 2 days on a single in light use.\n3. Camera is decent. As always Samsung camera is very good.\n4. Performance is very good. No doubtedly you can buy this device.\n5. It's not a CHINESE phone\n\nCons:\n1. Phone is bit heavy (220 grams). But its manageable.\n2. No slow motion or time lapse in camera.\n\nOverally very nice phone... I loved it...\nSamsung rocks....",
            "Ph is looking good & camera is awesome but some features are missing as per the comparison of MI 9 PRIME & let me see in future how is it work ?",
            "Listing out only most desirable points to know from realtime usage. Others you'll find on online reviews.\n\nPros:\nEfficient battery. It doesn't go well with gaming though\nHandling the device is easy for people like who spend a lot of time outdoors, given you equip with a right case\nGood build - surely will last for 4 years without intentional or accidental physical stress\n\nCons:\nMediocre camera for this segment. At this price you'll get awesome image quality from Mi, Realme and others.\nSound is not very detailed like competitors\n\nPSST:\nDespite the disappointments on key areas, I bought this phone for 2 reasons:\n1. Samsung's build quality! They last for years. Other chinese counterparts (excl. OnePlus) can produce good looking phones, might look good built, but won't last for long time.\n2. No bloatwares. I wanted my nieces who often use my phone to stay away from the bloatwares which I consider are dangerous for our privacy.",
            "Good phone at this priceing & and this phone is unique to all phones at this priceing and features.\nEverytime you note that samsung is BRAND.\nBATTERY \ud83d\udd0b is awesome \ud83d\ude09 take a long time to drain and\nRuns 1 day with full charge .\nGaming performance is still good but not much.Like BGMI you play at low graphics then performance of this mobile is too good.\nI like this phone \ud83d\udcf1",
            "Good option for normal users. It will be good if a back case is provided along with the package. 6000mah battery might not as good as others. But for a Samsung phone this is the best option. Quad camera set is is just okay. Macro shots and all are just average. But the wide angle camera is the most attractive one in this price range. The display is fine. Much brighter and clearer one. The phone is little bulky but it won't be a problem for us. For gamers you may skip this phone. This is not suitable for high end games. I repeat this is a normal phone for normal use. And with a good selfie and main camera.",
            "This Phone is awesome in this price point it has some graet features and I liked this Phone The display is HD+ but it fells like FHD+ the colurs and contrast are very good.And also the delivery boy was very cooperative",

Adaptive 90hz display is very smooth, but consumes a little amount of charge. But you can change it to standard 60hz, which is still a better display. It has One UI 3.1.\n\nPhone build is quite the same as other models like m12 and a12.\n\nFingerprint sensor is really fast.\n\nCall connectivity and quality is really good as all Samsung phones ..",

Good update timeline.\n5. For 720p display the viewing angles is decent.\n\n\nThings that could have been better:\n1. Slightly better Exynos chipset would have been good, but no lags felt probably due to the refresh rate.\n2. No Screen protector was pre applied on the phone's screen , which is not good given the fact that it is not easy to venture out and protect the display with a tempered glass, especially during pandemic times.\n3. Average cameras.\n4. Slow charger..18 or 20 w should have been the Norm.\n5.OneUI version does have ads but not as intrusive like MIUI, still can avoid as much as possible.\n\nOverall, if yoh feel like M12 is expensive , get F12 at a slightly lower price.",
