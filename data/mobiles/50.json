Few things like wide-angle lens, higher watt charger and OLED display are missing but with this pricing we cannot expect features of a premium phones. Processor is Dimensity 700U, it does the job perfectly. Realme has used a higher quality display and it does the job at its best, the auto brightness works excellently during the outdoor and indoor conditions. Anyone who is planning to buy a 5g ready smartphone (Depends upon the band release) like me for longer duration can go for this handset. I have always used stock android mobile phones, I was bit worried about the UI experience while purchasing Narzo 30 5g but I am fully satisfied with the UI experience since Realme has made it very close to the stock android. The build quality is also good. This is my first Realme mobile and I should say it worth the money I have invested. Thank you!",

            "Bought this phone after Geekyranjith review and this phone was a great combo of 5g, performance, great battery and good display. Camera is good outdoors and yeah indoor images has noise. Go for this if you want 5g bands, good battery and performance. Even display is good and value for money. Blot ware and permissions issue is a concern at times but we have to live with it if you buy a Chinese phone. Over all a good buy.",

            "It's really very good mobile and camara very good and battery also good and it's gaming Mobile not hanging mobile touch is very speed I love it this mobile specially I am happy for this mobile and I am love so much of this camera front and back",
            "Guys if you are a person who likes good battery and camera, then this phone is just good for you. But a point to note that it does make the colors a bit over contrasting but it can be fixed. I'm kind of a gaming person and this works just fine with me with giving me a battery stand of 8hrs and 30mins without hesitation. But sometimes it does stutter in terms of performance in big games. Shadow fight 3 sometimes shuts itself down without reason and COD does not have high graphic settings and still stutters sometimes. It does overheat but not much as other phones used to. Otherwise it is awesome in terms of connections cause it gives me more internet speed in comparison of realme Narzo 30 pro which is surprising. So it is a good phone.",
            "I am happy to share the experience about realme narzo 30 5g it was my first phone from the brand it was originally been taken by the oppo brand i should say it was nice and feels so light in hands talking about the performance and specs being offer on this price point was really great but i miss the amoled screen but the lcd ips provided on handset was not at bad brightness level is also perfect in direct sunlight as well although i completed my wordict about the phone is awesome and those are looking for beginner 5g set with 6gb 128gb variant just go for it till now but after few more days may be best one will be there in market as well",

            "Reviewing after 1.5 months of extreme usage of the phone. This phone is great for the Youtubers for the speed of editing the videos. As I am the Youtuber and I am in search of the phone which is never been hang in between of making the videos. The camera quality is good and the best part is face lock that it capture our face and not scan our face. Another thing is it is pre-installed with all the Google apps that you need in daily usage.\n\nThe best thing which I found that the virtual RAM which is expandable upto 11gb is the most convenient feature in the this price.\n\nNow look at some of the pros and cons of the product:\n\nPros:\n1. Camera is Good\n2. Auto scanning of text and documents while you capture.\n3. Long Battery \ud83d\udd0b life upto 25 hours with continue connect with Internet.\n4. No lagging of phone.\n5. Smart Sensors.\n\nCons:\n1. File Manager is not opening in first time.\n2. Almost in 2 days, the ringtone is set by default of the phone.\n3. Google Assistant is not working after a range of meter or two.",
            "I bought narzo 30 5g only for 1tb extended memory and dimensity 700 prosesor... Camera is good all though it's 48mp...2mp 2mp and ai I m happy with its performance after 2months... Battery is performing awesome it's big 5000 mah battery...\nCones are some apps open late file maneger, games ext.flash is not as good as I was expecting it's bit dull not producing enough brightness even in close environment...\nOverall it's a good product I m not a heavy user ... I m happy \ud83d\ude0a",
            "It's good quality phone and camera is so nice and clean picture clicking awesome sound quality is good both of speaker and microphone it's ram and room good quality.",
            "Realms Narzo 5g is awesome. Picture quality is very good and sharp. Battery backup is standard in nature.\nFull battery charge gives backup for 1 and half days. Very good and awesome phone in this price. Worth buying",
            "I have received this phone within 48 hours of order confirmation. Service is good by Flipkart. Now come to the phone, This phone looks premium and all features are good. Battery is really good and can sustain for two days use. Display is crystal clear and camera quality is also good. One drawback with this phone is that it doesn't have auto call recording option. While charging the phone there is not light notification so you are not able to know that whether battery is getting charged or it has been completely charged. You have to check it personally. Overall this is best 5G phone in this price range. I have shortlisted POCO and Redmi 8 but POCO don't have dedicated memory card slot and Narzo 30 5G is better than Redmi 8 5G. So satisfied with this phone. So giving it 5 Star.",

            "Good build quality.\nNice chipset.\nVery bright display like a super amoled.\n\ud83d\udd0a Speaker quit good.\nOverall good performance.\nBest gaming budget smartphone under 17k\ud83d\udc4d",
            "writing this review after 10 days of usage. First of all, its a good buy for a 5G phone with 7 band support. screen, camera, battery is all good and use to use. The quality of the built with expandable RAM, Android 11 and UI v2 is all good and no complaints. I was a snapdragon user till now and this is my first Mediatek processor, though this comes with Dimensity 700 I could still feel my earlier SD625 Octa Core was better. Doesn't lag but speed is not as per SD, clearly Mediatek is not a competition to Snapdragon.\nHeats up a little while charging and charging takes approx. 2 hrs from 0-100%. It comes with Dragontrail glass, which is again not a comparison to Gorilla glass.\nOverall, its a good phone at this segment especially for the 7 bands of 5G network support and 5k MAH battery. Go for it, if your budget is around 15k and looking for a future proof phone with 5G",
            "I'm happy to buy this phone \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udcf1 thank uh realme to make amazing mobile my father was so happy to using this mobile thank uh flipkart deliver correct time and deliver boy was really good nature thank uh guys \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude0a",

It provides only an average experience in camera performance.\n\nBATTERY\n\nAt present it gives a good battery life.idont know about future performance.now iam satisfied.\n\nDISPLAY\n\nIPS LCD is a good display.but don,t expect the experience like AMOLED display.

It is good for normal users.\n\nCAMERA\n\nCamera performance of this phone gives only an average satisfaction.i am not satisfied in camera experience.facing a grains problem while zooming.

            "Nice mobile ...\nIt's very nice under the 20k budget smart phones with 5G net work... I satisfied with the performance of the mobile in many areas.. but some improvement needs in the screen cast. Whenever I attempt screen cast with my sony tv it's getting connected but after some time it's automatically disconnected, that only made me dissatisfaction. Camera performance seems ok...90 Hz refresh rate is very good. Battery performance and stability is good...",
            "Phone is good for this price range, performance display is good, Camera is decent.\n\nThe only thing I do not like about this device is user interface. Earlier I used Motorola one fusion plus that device user interface is excellent near stock android. If you used stock Android or samsung phones earlier then you might feel realme UI is downgrade.",

So many hidden features makes it next generation.\nNo need to hesitate before buying it. No need to wait 2 or 3 month for Xiaomi phone. It comes with latest features.",

            "realme narzo 30 5G is the best 5G phone priced under 16000 rupees. I really liked the design of the phone its very attractive and stylish. The best part of the phone is it is 5G ready so we dont need to change our phone in future when 5G services are rolled out in India. The battery backup is also very good and the camera quality is also good. realme UI 2.0 is the best Android UI I have used in recent times. It is very smooth and comes with lots of customization options. At last I want to thanks flipkart for providing great offers and super fast delivery as always.",

Support 5G too though have few bands access, as don't see any 5G till 2022 in India. May not be as good as Iphone but can compete with other overpriced so called flagship phones selling around 30-40k. Gaming is running smooth.

            "Amazing phone",
            "I am pleasantly surprised by the Narzo 30 5G. Build & Quality\nThe size is just perfect in my medium sized hands and even though it has a polycarbonate body, it doesn't creak and the hand feel is very good mainly due to the curved edges. The back is almost like glass and the racing blue looks beautiful. The PU Case fits tight and I feel every user must use as it's edges being slightly raised the screen and the camera module stay protected.\nScreen\nEven though the screen is IPS it's much better than many other Amoled screens found on costlier phones because it's an excellent high quality screen. Also since it's FHD+ the resolution is excellent. The brightness is more than 400 nits and hence even in sunlight legibility is really very good. Being a 90 Hertz screen the scrolling is very smooth and there are no judders or stutter.\nSpeaker & Earpiece\nThe speaker is quite loud and most of the time you don't have to put it on full blast. But the quality is average.\nThe earpiece is loud and clear and there are no issues with it.\nCameras.\nThe main snapper is a 48 mp one and delivers very good results in Daylight, artificial light and the night shots are surprisingly good even on this budget phone. All in all the camera including the front one is good.\nBattery\nIt's a 5,000 mah LiPo and lasts me almost 2 days of medium use. The charger is an 18 watt one which takes 2\u00bd hours to charge the phone from zero. Wish Realme had provided at least a 30 watt charger in the box.\nOverall Experience\nThe phone performs very well and the Realme UI is fluent and smooth. It runs on Android 11 and works well. The best thing that it's Ad free and practically without bloatware. Also notifications can be turned off so users are spared the nuisance found on other budget phones which is a big relief.\nWiFi & Call Quality\nIt's dual band so both 2.4 and 5 Gigs can be used and the call quality and signal strength is not an issue. WiFi calling is enabled but I haven't had to use it so far so can't comment.\n\nAll in all an excellent phone and real Value for Money.",
