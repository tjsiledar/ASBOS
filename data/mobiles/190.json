            "A surprise box\n\nI got the delivery in within less than 20 hours. Thanks to Flipkart \ud83d\ude03.\n\nSo far this is my first Iphone. I was very excited about the device and also had so much expectations from it, all of which got fulfilled.\n\nFirst impressions:-\n\n1. Display:- So bright so vibrant. 10/10\nTrust me you wont feel like its a 60hz display.\nNot a single lag.\n\n2. Camera:- So good so pro. 10/10\nNo comments. Its super good.\n\n3. Battery:- this is the part where I'm so amazed. 9/10\nInstead of 3000 mah battery (almost), I'm getting 7 hours of SOT (screen on time) on mid to high usage.\nOnly reason I gave 9 is they increased the thickness so they could have added slightly bigger battery.\n\n*** Rest things are top to the class only wheather its a Processoror or speakers.\n\n\nAnd yes we don't get a charger with the device \ud83d\ude1c\n\n\n***Overall worth buying. I'm really satisfied with the purchase***",
            "Overall a classy and premium phone. As usual Iphones are too much over priced in India, so in my point of view this not at all gives a great value.\n\nPros: Good Battery, Best in market Processor, OLED Display, Stereo Speaker, premium built quality, Camera is pro enough at outdoor lighting Condition.\n\nCons: in 2022 with 70k phone 60Hz refresh rate is waist, Camera need to improve (Specially the best in feature Cinematic Mode) and the Charging supports upto 20 watt only (Seriously)....",
            "First of all, this is a nice switch from Android in terms of software experience and optimizations.\nThe kind of performance this iPhone offers is incredible. Even though this one is not having high screen refresh rates, it performs well compared to most of the android devices. Camera performance is fantastic, especially the cinematic mode is whole new experience.\nSo far, under minimal calls, normal usage (like checking notifications atleast once in an hour), atleast 2 hours of streaming videos a day, I'm getting a battery backup of more than a day or close to two days which is adequate. I see this as the biggest improvement apple was able to bring in when compared to 12 lineup.\nOnly drawback compared to my previous phone (OnePlus) is the time taken to charge the phone to 100%. It's bit in the higher side (Around 1.5-2 hrs) when compared to some of the android devices.\nIf you're looking for a switch from Android, this would be a nice choice. If you are already an iPhone user, this may not provide a great experience as the changes are very minimal from the previous generation of iPhones.",
            "My 1st iphone and I'm glad it is. With killer camera, amazing battery life, excellent performance this phone just rocks. The display even though is astounding but, in my opinion Samsung flagships displays are the best.\nI don't mind the display refresh rate being 60hz as you can hardly tell any difference in day to day use but, cmon apple it's 2022 and nowadays even 15-20k Android phones provide 120hz display.\nLast but not least security. Hmm well, there is no other phone as much secure as i...\nREAD MORE",
            "Got it in 2 days.so happy with the phone.starlight white is classy n suberb. That premium look is exquisite.Flawless ui... better battery backup.I am satisfied with the purchase.There is no phone like an iPhone :)",
            "Best phone that I ever had. Shifting from android to iOS,I have a worthy journey. Great camera, great performance,so easy to use. Recomending everyone.",
            "It's a new iPhone! It's faster than the last ones I guess, and it should be good for the next 80k miles. The only gripes I might have, probably is not with the phone but the latest incarnation of iOS. I had to go into settings to turn off facial awareness to have a loud ringer, and it seems my screen isn't nearly as sensitive to touch in text areas as my old XR. As I've said though, it's most likely something in the new Operating System yet to be ironed out. Still a nice piece of kit, yet no real surprises either. It does have a very nice camera for photos and video.",
            "Just okay, nothing great really. More hype, less substance. Camera is downright disappointing. It\u2019s great on the pro models, but not on this one. Low-light photography is good, but daylight photography is a disaster. Images start blurring up at the slightest zoom. My four-year old Samsung S9 plus produced far superior quality images than this. So I\u2019m really disappointed with the cameras on this phone and repent having payed a fortune for the same. Avoid buying this phone if you are looking fo...\nREAD MORE",
            "Very impressed with this order.. i phone 13 best in class , awsm camera quality, fastest in speed,\nVery happy with my product",
            "Awesome Phone loved the features. After using OnePlus i am switching from android to IOS. Loved the experience. Got this phone delivered within 3 days on diwali.",
            "Got in 2 day\u2019s only. Really it\u2019s unable to believe that Apple given so beautiful products. Really fall in love with this. Everything is perfect no need to mention each n every single thing. Flipkart is always ahead to provide such types of products. Thank you Flipkart & Thank you Apple. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc95",
            "Excellent after using 1 week and played Pubg, experienced a good battery and display with faster processor. Loved it",
            "I love this phone. Coming from an iPhone 6s, this is a huge upgrade. No regrets in this purchase and can guarantee this phone will last for more than 5 years with OS support and good performance.",
            "Super Buy. Phone is super fast though RAM size in paper less than competitors. Display super immersive, can use for hours without any eye strain. PREMIUM 5 STAR PRODUCT ANYDAY !",
            "Best iphone product till date. So smooth royal blue color. Loved it. Thanks fr great service from flipkart",
            "This is my first Iphone and I'm really glad that I decided to buy this. Everything about this phone looks so premium, battery backup is awesome, camera is top notch far better than any other Android phone available in the market. Thanks to seller and flipkart for quick delivery of this premium phone.",
            "Absolute beauty\u2026.. since being already an user of iPhone this just boosted the experience to all another level\u2026\ncamera is better and can be explored\u2026\u2026\nLook is good and pretty handy\u2026.\nBattery is okay as expected",
            "It\u2019s a perfect one. Build quality, camera (don\u2019t need to say anything on it), iOS, everything is good. You don\u2019t need an upgrade for next 4 to 5 years. So while upgrading androids every 1 or 2 years the amount we spent after 4 years will end up for one and half iPhone or two. So it\u2019s worth the money.",
            "Liked the phone. I upgraded from one plus 6 to this. Its smooth, camera is good, no heating problem till now and have enough space.\n\nGot the phone at a discount. I like Apple products for its durability.\n\nBut if you have iPhone 12 then you might not want to upgrade as the features are almost same. If you are choosing between iPhone 12 and 13, i would definitely suggest 13. In my case the price difference was around 2k and hence I tht of taking the latest one.\n\nAlso if you have an option to get the phone from US, then pls go fr 13 pro. It has more features than 13 and its worth the extra price. But definitely not worth a buy in india which is 40k more.\n\nThe other plus point is, you would get good buyback value for Apple products. So I am definitely happy with my purchase.",
            "1st time using an iPhone. Didn\u2019t expect to blend in so easily. Though it is different from android, however the system is still easy to use and super responsive. Having said that, there are still few functions in android that makes it easy to use and coming from android having need to pay for everything also is a new experience",
            "Did not liked the camera, difference is noticeable between pro max and standard iphone 13.\nPerformance, build quality and display is top top level.\nBattery backup is terrific good but basic charging and playing heavy games heats the phone on left side.\nSo overall 4* from my side.",
            "This is such a beast phone phone i ever had this is my first Apple phone but this... Is nice it's camera quality display performance is very nice I don't have a good experience of Apple phone's but ya when I use this I'll understand why they very expensive. :)",
            "Amazing camera over the top battery\nIf upgrading from anything from iPhone 11 (equivalent)\nOr under it will make the difference of the world\nBest phone if you can afford it",
            "A top notch! I\u2019ve upgraded to it from iPhone 11. iPhone 13 is by far the most flawlessly performing piece of quality hardware & software in a phone in 2022. Totally worth the money!",
            "Upgraded from 6s to 13. Good performance, great look. Overall had a good experience. Camera 5/5, especially cinematic mode. Go for it",
            "OMG, It\u2019s terrific I purchased it to gift my wife on anniversary. Very good punches 6.1 inches is very handy and can be managed by one hand it\u2019s camera captures very beautiful photos we are happy .battery backup is very fine one full charge remains for 1.5 days",
            "I cannot say more like the way Flipkart held this delivery. The contact people were in constant touch with me. Also when i selected open box delivery they delivery guy opened the box in front of me while recording video with his phone. What else a customer can think off. Also i don't think i can talk about endless benefits is the iphone. One work AMAZING!",
            "My very first iPhone and it was a massive shift from being an android fan, still adjusting, but love the red it's so delish and the UI is so smooth. I got it to make reels and I am stunned by the quality and speed. Once again a great buy. Did my research with iPhone 11 and 12 and the pro, and settled for this one. It does the job for me as I'm not an extreme professional to warrant extra cinematography styles of videos.",
