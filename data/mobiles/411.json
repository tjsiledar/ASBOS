            "Decent value for money phone. Reviewing after 4 month of usage as my primary phone.\n\nPros:\n1. SD 720G powerfull and capable midrange gaming processor.\n2. No heating issue observed.\n3. Super Amoled screen and always on display is brilliant.\n4. Decent all day battery life with medium to heavy usage. (1h games, 30m camera, 2h youtube/video, 2h browsing, all day whatsapp, email, phone, apps)\n5. Awesome 65watt superdart charging. Charges 0-100% in flat 35-40min.\n6. Back camera quality is good. Night photography is impressive.\n\nCons:\n1. Front camera not upto mark. Also there's a glow behind face.\n2. Back camera color saturation & reproduction is not upto mark. Not able to capture true color of dark color flowers.\n3. Uses useless google phone app. Specially annoying call recording announcement which inform both the parties that the call is getting recorded.\n4. Uses useless google messaging app for sms.\n5. No NFC or IR\n6. No FM Radio\n\nRealme should bring back their very own phone and messaging app or atleast ask google to stop announcing call recording for Indian use of the google phone app.",
            "Camera is decent. color saturation is not good.\nBattery is excellent\nFeels good to hold in hand\nSound quality is also great.\nGives a premium feel when holded in hand.\n...\nGreat phone. Absolutely worth the price with decent camera.",
            "Pros:-\n* Good battery backup.\n* Super charging speed.\n* Brighter SAMOLED display.\n* Back camera bump is very low.\n* Back camera quality is is very good, 64 mp is awesome and its camera AI detection feature is very good and you also love its Night Mode as compared to other cmeras in this range.\n* Awsome gaming performance. I am a heavy gamer.\n* Sound of dual stereo speakers is good.\n\nCons:-\n* Front camera's dynamic range was not up to the mark it washes out every thing but indore photography have no complaints. This problem should be shorted out by realme with a software update.\n* Its back was start vibrating when you listen something at full volume for its plastic back. My advice ia reduce volume by 1 or 2 point.\n* This is overpriced by 1or 2k\ud83d\ude20. But i love it\ud83e\udd70.\n* \ud83e\udd23 If i find more i will update that review.\ud83d\ude0e\n\n\u2022~\u2022Extra:- Every one talking about its build quality but i have no problem with that plastic back. I am using back cover.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Go for it if you want to buy a compact \ud83d\udcf2 with good \ud83d\udcf8 and \ud83c\udfae performance. You will never regret.\ud83e\udd14 Don't think more.",

            "Good buy !\n\nAfter a long research I got this phone.\n(Samsung M51 is bit bulky, has a better camera and better chip)\nYet I chose Realme 7 pro for its compact build with amoled display.\n\nPros -\n1. Good battery and 65 W charging.\n2. Awesome amoled display.\n3. Not heavy phone as compared with PocoX3 n M51.\n4. Headphone jack.\n5. Realme UI - Actually it's better than MIUI and launcher is close to Stock launcher.\n6. No heating issue. Gets bit warm on charging and that's ok compared to other flagship phones.\n\nCons -\n1. Front camera not up to mark.\n2. Phone back vibrating on high Volume.\n3 .Not for ultra graphics gameplay. High or medium graphics playable.\n4. No NFC and IR\n\nOther -\nRear camera is decent.\nGaming is not bad (no lags). Mobile legends was playable in high graphics.\nNo lags in everyday use.",

No NFC and IR\n\nOther -\nRear camera is decent.\nGaming is not bad (no lags). Mobile legends was playable in high graphics.\nNo lags in everyday use.",

            "Bought it on 16th Oct, Got it on the 19th.\nHonest detailed review after using it for about 3 days.\nDon't go by the Ads and paid technical reviews.\n\nThis is the same Realme 6 pro with 3 new things:\n1. sAmoled Display, due to this In-display fingerprint.\n2. 65W SuperDart charger, full 4500mAh battery charges in 35mins.\n3. Stereo Speakers - earpiece also works as a speaker, works decent but not that good.\n\nBuy this phone (7 pro) only if you like:\n1. Lightweight ~180g - less stress on your 2 little fingers while carrying it.\n2. Bloody fast charging - 30 mins charge can easily last a day for medium usage.\n3. sAmoled display - much brighter and richer multimedia and social media experience. Newly improved Realme UI, In-display fingerprint, and protection of Gorilla Glass 3+.\n4. Selfie, Video calls lover - 32MP does the job. Realme 6 pro had 16MP. The top left notch is small which is easy to ignore.\n5. Battery which lasts up to 6-7 hours a day.\n6. 2 nano SIMs (4G) + SD Card slot.\n7. Quad camera setup. 64MP and Macro pics. It is not the best but also not the worst camera.\n8. Curved corners body, corners are carved beautifully to fit in your palm when you are holding it in a landscape mode.\n9. Overall ergonomic design, the slim and tall shape fits just best in your hand. You can reach the most left situated app icon with your right thumb.\n10. SAR Value is less (like Samsung) which means fewer emissions, fewer radiations passes to your head and body.\n11. 720G 8nm processor, 618 GPU, 2 x 2.3GHz cores, UFS 2.1, Android 10, Always-on display, Water-repellent (not resist) coating.\n12. Games run smoothly on Medium settings. I played Asphalt 9 and CS for more than 5 hours and didn't find any stutter.\n13. 3.5mm Headphone jack is there, the sound is nice.\n14. Downloading and uploading speeds are really good - both through WiFi and via 4G mobile data. I checked Airtel and Jio.\n15. Case provided within the box is tight enough, but you would still require a screen guard.\n\n\nTake it with a pinch of salt:\n1. Plastic frame that looks like a glass back, attracts fingerprints from day 1.\n2. 720G may look weird sometimes, we expect it to perform but it hangs many times. You will often end up closing some apps without even properly opening it (eg. VLC player).\n3. 20GB is already used out of 128GB brand new phone who just finished installation - that's about 15% of total storage.\n4. Bloatwares - I had to uninstall 10 of them. Realme was related to about 5 of them.\n5. Whenever you download any app, a weird white screen appears every time which says OPEN or OK. If you install 20 apps, you will have to click OK 20 times for every individual app.\n6. Power button and In-display fingerprint icon are located too low from the ideal place. Both should have been located a little bit up.\n7. In-display fingerprint (IF) works 6/10 times provided your thumb isn't oily or sweaty. Face unlock is pretty fast. There is a fancy light animation around the selfie camera to help you locate where to see. At night, when you lower the brightness and use the IF, the animation brightness is not lowered and it pokes to your eyes a lot.\n8. No FM radio, No IR blaster, No infrared, No NFC.\n9. As you start using the storage, beyond 50% size you can sense the phone is struggling to do multi-tasking.\n10. No 90Hz refresh rate (which was there in 6 pro with IPS LCD display) and here there is sAMOLED! Would have been a perfect combination for a tall bright screen display.\n\n\nHope this review helps you to take a decision for your investment. It is a good phone for daily routine tasks - WhatsApp, insta, v.calls, youtube, but don't expect MS Excel, extreme gaming, quick responses.\n\nRegards\nHussain Hamza",

            "I'm giving this review after using this phone after 1 month...\n\nPros:\n1. Camera is really superb. Macro and 64 MP quite impressive.\n2. Smooth scrolling is really nice.\n3. SnapDragon 720G processor is all rounder. No lagging issue or heat issue found in the game.\n4. Sound is not bad at all. Dolby Atmos is good for both playing games and music.\n5. The masterstroke feature of the phone, 65W charger. You take bath for 10-15 min, phone's charge will go to 60% from 10%. (0-80)% take hardly 22-25 min. And 4500 mAh battery is good running all day.\n6. For gamers, (Ram+Storage+Processor) is the basic thing. And this phone got everything, 6/128 or 8/128 both are well for any gamer with 720G Processor.\n\nNow come Cons:\n1. Using under direct sunlight is quite down. Cause brightness in this phone is little bit low.\n2. 65W charger only found with this phone only, not in any other offline/online/Realme store. So use it carefully.\n3. Colour boosting in photos, that's really not new for you if you are Realme user from earlier.\n4. The back cover given on the box is not good. Quite cheap quality. I suggest if you are not buying 'Sun Kissed Edition', you should buy an extra back cover of good quality.",

Quick charge with in 30min with 65 W charge.. no need to carry power bank and this will lost 1 full-day with day (12 hours) with full internet on and heavy browsing usage..\n2. Photo clarity looks decent..\n3. Dual speakers with Loud and crisp in detail\n4. No heating issue\n5. Call quality is very nice and also very loud\n\nCons:\n1. Even it is Snapdragon 720G processor, it lags many times and apps closed automatically\n2. Can't pull signals if you go to remote area or where there is less network\n3. Front cam is not up to the mark\n4. Real me UI is not good as MI UI and many adds floating in the notifications\n5. No IVR blaster in this mobile, hence you can't connect to any device.. even tried with third party apps\n6.highly priced just for 65W charger as in the same price you can get 5G device\n7.Super amole display is not like Samsung or Oppo device.. the display is disappoint you when you compare with Oppon F17 or Samsung A series display.\n8. Haven't tried PubG but when I use trading apps like kites by Zerodha or angle broking apps most of the time it won't respond or lags.. need to restart multiple times\n9. The device back design is very dull.. I selected Blue.. pathetic color and it is just plastic body. Use good carry case..\n\nHope this helps and over all this is just OK device... Worth around 15K.. not more than that..",

Looks good, Cute and Very good.\n\n2. Seriously, 5+ stars to the camera for it's excellence. My frnds who bought RealMe 8 with 108 MP Camera told me it's performance was not satisfactory.\n\n3.Loving the Battery. Charges 0 to 100 percent within 15 mins. And that lasts for a whole day. You only get to charge the next day again.\n\n4.It's been 10 days since my phone arrived and no performance/hanging/crashing issues. Only once, the phone was overheated but that's because of opening a lot of applications and leaving them in the background. My suggestion...remove all the backround-running apps every now and then and you'll not face any.\n\n5. This is a very handy product. Very hands and pocket friendly.\n\nGo ahead and buy it!",

But still, its decent and costs almost half of that of 5T. Well, you would think why I downgraded myself, then I must tell you that I just wanted a secondary phone and after using both the phones, I am giving you a side by side comparison.\n\nBut, there's a huge bump in the camera department, I would say this is the best camera in this price range and a whole lot better camera than 5T.\n\nColor OS is now also trying to give a smoother experience but, you also know it cannot beat the Oxygen OS. It has minimal ads but it is there and Oxygen OS has a clean experience. Also, the Auto brightness sensor always keep the phone on a bit darker side, that I have to always brighten up a little bit more.\n\nBattery life is pretty good and has whopping 65 W Super Dart charger which juices it up in less than 40 minutes, and now I feel my 5T drains out very quickly !\n\nSo, the conclusion is that this was the best phone to buy under 20k until March 2021 but if I would have waited a little longer then I would have gone for Realme 8 pro.

            "Purchased this mobile after using Samsung M31. Pros and cons are relative as comparison with earlier phone is obvious. I am using an 8GB ram variant.\nPros\n1) Amazing fast charging.\n2) Marginal improvement in performance as compared to Exynos processor in samsung M31.\n3) Realme UI seems to be light and tad fast over one UI.\n4) Spot on face detection unlocking.\n5) Marginally better camera than M31.\n6) Good haptic feedback.\n7) Silicon case in box is a nice goody to have.\n8) Excellent network reception and call quality.\nCons\n1) Noticably slow in display finger print scanner.\n2) In display finger print scanner does not work if phone is kept in pocket for long time. Possibly due to frequent incorrect impressions while the phone is in pocket.\n3) Amoled screen on samsung is better than this.\n4) Despite being powered with Snapdragon, performance is not out of the world. Seems like Exynos has improved a lot and Snapdragon has come a step down. I would still say that Snapdragon is better but not by a big margin.\n5) One UI had some interesting features like delete a text message from notification pane itself.

            "Two weeks in use and here is a normal users review. This is a very good phone. The amoled screen is quite good. The stereo speakers are loud enough and have depth. The fast charger is a boon. Battery easily lasts a day with ample to spare for overnight discharge to get it quickly charged first thing in the morning. Put it on and by the time you get your morning chores and sit for breakfast its ready to go. Realme UI has so far been light and zippy. The call reception, wifi, bluetooth etc all work good and help in getting through the day without any issues. The form factor is also good both for media consumption as well as single handed use. The width and thickness are close to being perfect. The underscreen fingerprint sensor works good. If hands are wet then it's iffy. I haven't tried face unlock. Transferring from old phone was also hassle free with the step by step guide. That's it.\nBig shout out to Flipkart for early delivery. Please be prepared atleast a day ahead in case of exchange as the items can reach you early and catch you off guard. Only issue was the exchange offer which did not work out eventhough the old phone was in good condition. First time I faced this issue. Maybe it's one off. That's it and hope these words are useful to some.",

Display - Super Amoled Display is bright and good.\n\n3. Processor - Qualcomm Snapdragon 720G processor performance is fantastic for flawless gaming and superb also for daily use.\n\n3. Battery - I think battery should be bit more, 4500mAH battery lasts just in 1 day in normal daily use use.\n\n4. Charging - 65 watt dart charger is amazing, charges 0 to 100% just within 35 minutes.\n\n5. Audio quality is good enough, design is sleek and lightweight.\n\n6. Call Recording - Mobile has call recording option but there is no settings for Auto Call Recording, everytime, we have to start recording during the call. And when we start or stop recording, it makes a announcement which other side caller can hear clearly that you are recording the call.\n\nMy thought - Battery size will be more than 5000mAH and price should be around 16k to 18k, It's more pricey as comparative to Redmi Note 9 Pro Max and Poco M2 Pro. Both the phones have the same processor, more battery size and many more other features.",

I can't even return it now because the return window is already over so i have to live with it for like 3 years but this might just be my first and last ever realme phone.\n\nI'm also kinda disappointed with Flipkart because when we put a phone on exchange they look for tiny micro scratches and make major price cuts but they hand out defective units like this to their customers .. really pathetic.\n\nEdit; using this phone past 2 months now and i just got news that this phone uses a ramless display. This means that realme used a cheap amoled panel that cannot store patterns and has to rely on CPU. You won't get any AOD customisation no mantra support nothing. Realme withheld this information from us consumers that it used cheap quality displays it's even worse than displays used on realme XT and X2.. idk why I'm not surprised. I can't wait for 2 years with this phone so i can throw this garbage.",

Having had a good experience earlier I went ahead with buying the realme 7 pro, I got 2 of them as my wife also needed a new phone. I am very disappointed with the performance of this phone. It isn't anywhere close to what social media influencers and other garbage review sites mention. The phone has become slow to the point that the screen stutters at times, the battery was bad to begin with but now it has become worse, 7% - 0% in less than a min with screen on. with every passing update realme seems to try and push more and more bloatware. You cannot even delete these useless apps.. my mom's MI phone which costs less than half of this garbage phone gives twice the battery life.. anyway I have learnt my lesson and will most certainly stay away from garbage brands like this. I regret not spending some more money and getting the one plus Nord.. despite all the flaws of this phone I do appreciate the fast charging and in display fingerprint scanner. Everything else is just pure garbage\n\nFinal verdict\nStay away from this phone, buy pocco / mi or just about any other brand and keep rest of the money for an upgrade in the future. This phone is not worth spitting on.",

Front camera stabilization is very bad. No dual video.\n\nI purchased this phone thrice (3 times). In my opinion this phone is best all-rounder under 25k.

            "Review after 17 days (haven't done any updates)\n\nSCREEN : Good amoled screen. Good colours and contrast, especially blacks.\nBrightness level is also fine.Auto brightness makes screen dimmer in darker places and goes upto 50% brightness in well lit rooms.\n\nBATTERY : Takes 43 min to charge from 0-100%. Got minimum 8 hrs screen on time from 100-0%(medium usage like YouTube,movies,Subway surfers,whatsapp).Got maximum 12 hours screen on time.\n\nPERFORMANCE : Smooth 60 Hz scrolling. Opening apps is very fast and no lag in that.Found some stutters while scrolling (very rarely). Opened pdf files in google drive crashes after keeping them 2-3 hrs idly in background. No heating found for medium usage.\n\nCAMERA : Takes good detailed default 16 mp photos from back cam. Colours are natural. Front cam tends to whiten skin tones,just like 3rd party beauty camera apps. Over exposure is a problem in front and back cam. Other than that, it takes good quality pictures.\nVideo quality & stabilization is good. Camera module gets warm to little hot in case of video recording for minimum 4 min.\n\nSOUND : Earphone output is good quality. Stereo speaker output makes back panel vibrate ( not very much) even at low volume.Vibrations felt even after putting case. While recording,audio seems to be recorded with less volume.\n\nCALL QUALITY : call quality is good and proximity sensor working fine too. Call recording lets other person on call know that the call is being recorded",

The overall specs, performance, usage feel, battery package with 65 w dart charger, are comparable to one segment higher phones. And that's why the all-rounder tag !\nConsidering 5g roll out and that too all India availability is far off, (currently just 5g compatibility in a phone allows for other features to be compromised by the Cos. in my view) this is a hard to beat offering across budget to mid range of smart phones !",

            "I am writing this review after a month. Phone is really good & also phone making is good from realme . I am going to explain a phone according my usage .My usage is very normal like 2 to 3 hours gaming & arround half hour social media.\n\n1 :~ Phones hardware .\nPhone lookes really very good around this price range. If I am taking for design , realme done good job , like it's speakers is good & loud , power button & volume buttons are realme judge their value .if I am taking about back , it is matyy and camera module is also good . But the one thing I note back panel is not as shine as picture shown , it is littel down from expectation but it will be ignore . Sound quality is good but when I am listening some songs from phone litterly phone was tremble my fingers are feels that trembling .\n\n2 :~ display\nIt is good .it is litterly big & bright.\n\n3 :~ Camera\nThe realme 7 pro comes with lots of camera features. photos are above the expecting. Video quality is much much better with 64 MP camera .\n\n4 :~ bettery\nIt is most important part which we really need .\nIt has aroud 4500 MAH bettery with 65 WT charging. bettery part is really disapointed me .like my usege is nothing like complare to other users. I used my phone for below 5 hours per day. But bettery drain very fast in this timeline . If I am using my phone around 8 to 9 hours i need to charge for twice .I know it has 65 WT fast charging but it doesn't metter when we do some travelling.\n\n\n5:~ Finger print sensor\nRealme 7 pro has under display finger print sensor . Almost time it works very well ..but some times it fails . I noticed when I add another finger and want to turn on from that finger it doesn't on .\n\n6:- Software optimization\nI buy max variant of realme 7 pro which is 8 + 128\nGb storage..still it is Lag some times when I playing some games even some times it lags in instagram also .. realme need to work on that .\n\n7 :~ Other\nRealme sending updats on regular basis that was the plus point . Also In the box we have some accessories like phone case which is good quality, data cable & 65 WT charger also screen guard. Also network strength is good .",

In terms of battery 4500 mah is little low.If you have heavy use battery will drain fast but the superfast charger makes for it. I tried playing several games it was smooth.I played pubg it is smooth I got 40 fps while playing it.But the phone is heating a bit around the camera region I guess it where the battery is. Fast charging is not good for your battery that is why iPhone is still giving only 5w chargers(they have upgraded it). If you have 20k go for this it best in this phone range",

The phone has all kind of great hardware it needs to be a mid ranger, but the overall optimisation and user experience is still not up to the mark.\n\nSetting up office email is definitely a TASK, which wasn't the case in the predecessor.\n\nAlso this is a through and through Google Phone.

            "Super",
            "Review after a month's use:-\n\n1) 30 mins full charging along with day long battery is nothing short of flagship phone.\n\n2) Screen is definitely better than IPS for movies, video and gaming but under direct sunlight it has lower brightness than IPS screen, so if you spend more time outdoor this has to be considered. Also this phone has \"sunscreen protection\" where screen might have RGB tint in very low light, more visible in white screen but most of times you won't notice it. I contacted realme they told this was a feature not a bug!\n\n3) OS is well optimised but there are some bloatware, turn off notification if you can't uninstall those apps and ad is shown every time you install an app, it can also be turned off. Not sure why these things have to be there in the first place 20,000 is not cheap- to come with this bloatware and ad, realme is damaging it's brand or just tell 20,000 (\"With offer\") like Samsung or Amazon.\n\n4) Camera is a letdown for me, but this can be subjective. Rear camera is not bad and front isn't very good. Also useless macro camera instead they could have kept the telephonic camera. Night mode is decent.\n\n5) Sound - Loud but not very clear, stereo is decent obviously call speaker can't compensate for dedicated speaker but appreciate to have a stereo speaker. Panel is indeed vibrating like many people pointed out but kind of negligible in my opinion.\n\n6) Call - Proximity sensor isn't that good, in multiple instances my screen have turned on while keeping phone in my ear and hold/mute or even end buttons have been clicked by my cheek! Like you have to be very conscious about the positioning- i feel this is a downside of having bezel less display.\n\n7) Miscellaneous - Headphone Jack is a plus(Ha! who would have thought) , face unlock and on screen fingerprint works well. Also appreciate the case cover provided by realme it's more than enough, in the world of no chargers in box, including even a case is a luxury.\n\nTo sum it up if this phone had a better camera this would be flagship killer's killer.",

Display is too good as a sAmoled should be.. The dual speaker setup gives you a beautiful sound..(Trible is little bit higher than the bass).. And the best thing which i liked the most is it's comfortable handy size.. It feels good in my hand.. Fingerprint is fast and the face lock is super fast... The only problem i faced is it's back side.. because it vibrates when the volume is higher than 50%... But it will not be a big problem at all..\n\nAnd now let me tell you the game changer thing 65W superDart charging.. Just wow.. It's awesome.. It can really charge your phone 5 to 100 in just 38 minutes... I use WhatsApp fb insta and youtube too much.. and it gives me 15 hours backup in a single full charge... And that is enough for me.. Also if you're confused between Poco x3 and realme 7 pro just like i was.. I would definitely suggest you Realme 7 pro..",

Very disappointed..\n\nFacts:\nMinor body vibrations are there when sound is played but that can be ignored considering the sound quality and sterio speaker setup,\nIn-display fingerprint postion can be moved bit upwards for better usability,\nI returned a Redmi note 9 pro max due to poor network reception and now I'm very happy that the same sim has super fast network speed...\n\nHighly recommend to all...\n\nAfter few weeks, I wiill update my review if I get any issues..",

The photos taken are too bad as just a little zoom and you can see the image is broken. It has 64 mp camera but I can say a 2 mp Nokia mobile can take better photos than it. I am saying this after 2 updates on my phone. It seems they are unable to fix their camera app. I have redmi note 8 pro and that takes a 100 times better photos than this phone. It is not worthy to have a phone for only fast charger because with the same ram capacity and processor you can have a great phone. I am writing this after 45 days use. I will recommend any redmi phone over it as they can quickly fix any bugs on their phone.",

            "This review is re edited after 5months of usage,\n\nWat I call this master piece as an best phone in this price range,\n\nI will tell some thing which is not in details.\nProns\nBest in camera with Sony censors, AI is just amazing, Real me optimization will make your every click picture perfect, especially Night mode, portrait, 64mp is out of the words in this segment range phone, which is all the same camera setup used by realme in their upcoming X7pro 5g.\n\nBattery charging just because of super draft charge, I rarely put charge, that to maximum of 40mins for 100% in every 2nd day middle.\n\nBackup for battery is awesome, if you are a long traveller are frequently traveling person this is the time to buy this master piece\n\nPhone looks very thin & Handy. Pls buy one basic back case.\n\nDisplay is just amazing in night or use in sunlight.\n\nMulti screen or multi apps usage is friendly\n\nNo hanging problem\n\nNo heating problem\n\nEveryone will admire at your phone for sure.\n\nIt's serves you with real me u I 2, which makes an additional benefit.\n\nNo need to worry about storage space\n\nYou can also use clones for your apps\n\nYou will get frequent update for your software.\n\nBest phone to buy in this price range.\n\n\nCons :\nWhile recording your calls, it will loudly tell Your call is recorded, which really makes irritates, still hoping for Real me update for clear this bug.\n\nIf it's connected to your Bluetooth truly buds, it may get disconnected some times frequently..",

Need to disable AI beautification to look natural. And it's 8Mp wide angle (119') is Good, it cover wide area.\n5) Simple and elegant design, little light weight. Feels very handy.\n6) Finger print sensor is good even in outdoor. In outdoor it takes little more time but it's ok.\n7) Call quality is good even in less network coverage area as it supports WiFi calling(WiFi should be connected).\n\nCons:\n1) Front camera is not that good. Need software optimization. If you take selfie in outdoor with no background ( 70%sky 30% random background), then photo will have full white background. If on better background or wall then it takes nice selfie photos.\n2) There is a browser comes with the phone which can't be uninstalled or disable it. Even if you stop it's process, it restart it self again and gives you anoyying news notification. Other than that you can uninstall other apps if you don't need them.\n3) it is not given any rating for dust proof and water proof/resistant.\n4) RealME OS needs little optimization, sometimes it feels little lagging (hangs).",

We can adjust that in the setting.\n2) Camera - is just average. Red tshirts and object will have a little bit pinkinsh tone to it. Instead of red colour. Portrait selfies is a bit disappointing, Because background will be blown out if we are in outdoors or in bright environment.\n3) Battery- just average - on day to day usage with our apps installed, we will get around 6hrs screen on time. This is not bad, its on par with others in the same segment. still could have done better. Slight disappointed\n4) Charging - super fast. It will take around 40-45mins. Realme claims 34mins. But for me and others it will take around 44mins.\nFrom 4-20% in 5 mins\n36% in 8mins\n45% in 12mins\n\nBut remember charging like that will drain the battery faster. Idk\n\n\n5) Speakers- Below average. Its loud. But Zero bass. Volume is lill bit distorted in max volume. Back vibrates when speakers work. Due to plastic back\n\n6) Build quality and materials used is average quality\n\n\nDm me on instagram- bullet_pranthan",

They play only number game in no. of camera but realme forget improve of quality.\nSD 720G is good processor and power efficient and good for daily usage.\nUnder fingerprint display is good experience which is cool feature.\nSome cost cutting in realme 7 pro like polycarbonate back panel they can add glass panel in this price.\nOverall a good package and you can buy it.",

            "Overall a great phone under the 20K bracket right now.\n\nPerformance\nThe Snapdragon 720G performs like a charm, and because of its 8nm build, it is battery efficient, so people who are saying 4300mah is low, it isn't.\n\nCamera\nThe Sony IMX682 sensor is very capable, specially the Night Mode feature is excellent. The 32MP front camera lacks dynamic range, which realme should fix with an Update, if not, you can always install GCAM, it works efficiently in this phone.\n\nDisplay\nThe 20K price tag is justified for this phone just because of it's AMOLED display, yes the Samsung M31 does provide an AMOLED display at slightly lower price, but people should know that M31's processor is outdated and very inefficient for heavy usage.\n\nBody\nHonestly speaking, personally I am not concerned much about whether it has Glass Body or a Plastic Body, because\n1. Glass Body makes the phone heavier, whereas this realms 7 pro is just perfect at 184 grams, not a big fan of heavy phones.\n2. The design of polycarbonate looks just way more attractive than a glass build and anyway people are going to use the TPU case provided in the box, so nobody would care after sometime whether your phone has a Glass Build or a Plastic Build.\n\nUser Interface (Realme UI)\nThe next UI after Oxygen OS which resembles the most like Stock Android is Realme UI. It has the app drawer, it has the clean look, it has it's own set of classic features and it is smooth and you can DISABLE THE ADS in the Settings. There won't be any ads forced on you, relax.",

This is pretty impressive.\n\n64MP Sony camera is not fully satisfying. Could have preferred Nikon camera instead. But upon exploring the camera settings properly one can get the right images.\n\nBattery Draining moderate. Neither slow nor fast\n\nAuto call recording option is included through call settings itself. No separate app for this. People need to check this before giving reviews.\n\nSlow motion videos/portait/ bokeh features awesome.\n\nDolby stereo feature is added advantage for music lovers like me.\n\nPerformance is mind blowing. With 8GB RAM, zero hanging and zero heating effects..super smooth sliding performance.\n\nOnly unsatisfactory thing is 64MP Sony camera did not reach the expectations.\n\nOverall 5/5 for this amazing phone..\n\nRealme 7 pro is the Winner among redmi 9pro max and Samsung m31.",

No different notification sound for dual.skm.but common for both.\n11 Dialer screen required quite some improvement.\n\nThe above are just an initial inference.\n\nApart from above..A decent phone but bit more priced.\nAfter 6 months use\nPlease refrain on buying realme or oppo within 6 months the price crashed by 3k, not even the emi is finished.
