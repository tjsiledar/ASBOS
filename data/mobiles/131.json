            "Vivo has made an excellent light weight and slim phone. It's feels so light in hand after upgrading with my MI 10T. Black colour looks classic because of matt & AG glass finish. Even screen size is excellent not too small & not too large. Amoled screen used is of premium quality. Both the rear & front camera gives great result. Double flash in front camera is awesome it gives unbelievable result in dark. There's some lag in ui because they have provided latest Android 12 os. I am confident that issue will be resolved in following updates. Battery life is sufficient for a day & charging is quick because of good quality flash charger. There's only one con that the phone have dimensity 920 processor...should have provided more powerful processor. Rest for sure it's a satisfactory purchase. In box they have given 44 w flash charger & good quality wired earphone.",

Display is above average but not top class\n3. Camera is just average. The camera angle is always wide even if the zoom is 1x mode. This create problems for clicking photos. The normal angle can only be set if the zoom is 1.5x.\n4. In the night time when the flash is enabled, it is taking time to click the photos and it is a worst experience\n5. Design wise it is excellent option.\n6. Battery is not that great, but fast charging is good. If you are not a regular user, then you may not need a second charging for the day.\n\nIf the camera is a primary concern, then go for samsung mobiles. Overall I did not meet my expectation.",

            "The phone is good and the batter backup is also good as this is a new phone but in terms of cost it does not appears to be rational. The price of thr phone make appears to be good. Charger of the phone is good as it charges the phone within 30 min which is definitely an advantage. The headphone is still the ols one, with new age phone one should consider adding a better headset if the price remains the same. Planning to have another phone however I don't think my search will end up with the same phone\ud83d\ude15",
