            "Who all loves older size i.e., 4.7 inch type should definitely go for this. Nothing is better than XR, XS or 11. Best for price and usage.",
            "Can be surely preferred as your first iphone\nValue for money\nSome what battery is not sufficient but as we already know about the batteries of iphone\nCamera is up to mark but there is insufficiency of night mode wideangle mode but that\u2019s ok its not a big deal\nDisplay performance is good enough\nOverall lookup is impressive and off course attractive\nSpeakers are mind blowing dual speaker setup which is quite loud compared to others\nAt this price range this phone is best if you are interested in ios",
            "Great camera for pics and videos\nBattery life is good so far with some setting turn of which i never use and when i use i turn those on and i use it in power saving mode all the time so a full day with light gaming of 1hr or more using camera for 1hr or more listening music in my car on youtube and Bluetooth on for couple of hours it gives me full day of battery varing from 4/5 to 6/7 hours sot per day\nPerformance is top notch plays every game and every task with ease\nVery premium phone looks great in red colour small handy phone",

            "This iPhone SE is the best phone ever you get. Beautifully designed gives a classy look in your palms. Moreover, performance wise it is a benchmark. You will not be disappointed in this budget. My purchase point was its size. If you are looking for the same you won\u2019t be disappointed.\n\nI strongly recommend this phone to people who is more work oriented. Game loves should skip this phone as this is not a game phone.\n\nBest features with stunning looks & performance.\n\nBattery life is very good. You need to manage couple of features in phone and phone works with optimum battery level throughout day.\n\nGo for it even if you\u2019re first time iOS user.",

            "I have Purchased The new Iphone SE 2020 on 20th May 2020, So based on my usage for a week I can rate the product as follows\n\n* Pros: 1) Display quality seems to be very good.\n2) Camera quality is excellent , takes a very sharp images without any blurriness.\n3) Touch sensor works very precisely\n4) Durability of the phone is good as the quality of body is made of 6000K aluminum which is one of the most durable aluminum in the mobile-industry\n5) Speed of the phone is excellent bcz of the latest \"A13 Bionic Processor,\" which is most advanced processor used in Iphone 11.\n\n\nCons: 1) The major disadvantage in using this Phone I found in the Battery, As Apple has given an official statement of having \"13 hrs of video playback on full charged\" is not true as Battery get drained within 4 hrs of usage, so if you are using a phone for longer duration don't go for this phone.\n\n2) Screen Size 4.7\" seems to be very short as per the cost of the phone. It could be at least 5.3\".\n\n3) Iphone SE has an Heating problem, I don't whether this issue is encountered in every Iphone or not, but in my Phone it is there & phone gets heated very badly in sudden. while having on video call , gaming or while charging.\n\n4) Hotspot is taking atleast 8 to 10 min while connecting it to other systems Wifi or laptop Wifi which is another major cons I observed.",

If you want a small screen phone just for working purpose no entertainment\n4. If you have another phone as backup\n5. If you have other apple products and you want to pair this up as your latest purchase.\n6. If you have a decent 42k to spend without any second thought.\n\nWhy not to buy?\n1. Battery drain, and low battery capacity\n2. If you are a gamer.\n3. If you are hardcore user\n4. If you already have used bigger screen models\n\nThe only concrete drawback the phone has is the battery capacity, since it also supports wireless charging, you can get a decent charge quickly yet its for normal use only.\nYou will love it if you love apple products and trust me Go for the RED, if you want to create an impression with this sweet little beauty.\n\nHope that it clears your mind.",

It is super fast\u270c\ufe0f.\n\nOverall it's the same iPhone 6 with an A13 chip and the generation updates a smartphone can get in 2020.\n\nNo negative comments for the camera, apple is always the topper in capturing moments and SE2 has got the studio lights, a front facing portrait camera, a wider photo frame and much more features.\n\nTo be honest the cost is a bit higher, iPhone 7 plus can also be considered with this price tag and if you're someone curious in updations, go for it.\n\nThe only con side that i have noticed is with the phone charging capability as it is taking a lot more time a smart phone can get charged in this 2020.Almost took an hour to reach 30% of charge.\n\nMust note this point\u261d\ufe0f\ud83d\ude35\n\nThe above said all are true to my knowledge and always listen to multiple opinions before you go for it.",
            "This is an amazing phone for the price. For someone coming from a pure Android background, migrating data would take a little time, and the battery backup may be quite less for the first 1-2 days. Once it is all set, I felt that the phone gives a decent battery backup. The backup with the ~1800mAh battery on this phone is somewhat comparable to that of an Android with twice the capacity.\nCamera is amazing for my use, as the lighting and colour tone are Natural, close to what we would see with our bare eyes. I did not see any grains kicking in during low light conditions.\n\nSince the phone is relatively small, and since I personally prefer this size, it feels amazing in hand.\n\nOne thing that could have been better is the charger that is shipped with the phone. Even though the phone supports fast charging, it is shipped with a 5V 1A charger. With it, the phone takes around 1.5 hours to go from 20% - 100%. Not a bad number, but it would be better to have the 12W charger in the box.\n\nOverall, this is the best phone in this price segment.",
            "This is my first iPhone. And after using it for 6 continuous days the difference between my previous Sony XZS Android and this iPhone is easily noticeable. The camera is better in every way. The only thing I miss about my previous phone is the 960 frame/sec super slow motion recording. Performance is way too better than android. This is fast, very very fast. If your eyes are not glued with the screen the battery life is ok. In fact this is the only issue with this phone. This one fits in my one hand very comfortably which I love the most. In single word this is the RED DAGGER for android flagships phones.",

            "Writing this review after around 1 week of use.\nUpdating this review after a further 2 weeks of use.\n\nInitially, there was some heating on the phone, but on further use that problem has disappeared. Got to explore the camera a bit more and found it to be very good, the stability on the video is also good.\n\nPros -\n1. Good Camera Quality. Image quality is very good. Pictures are sharp. Good performance in bokeh mode.\n2. Good performance. The phone has no lags so far, it is very smooth and fast to use. The response time is less and smooth for all the apps and touch I'd.\n\nCons -\n1. Small battery capacity. The battery is really small, for medium users it takes atleast charging it twice in a day. Not a phone for gamers. Battery capacity prohibits you from using complete advantage of the fastest A13 bionic chip.\n2. Camera does not have night mode, without night mode pictures in low light is not good.\n\nThe phone is compact, fits in your hand easily and has large bezels, but overall phone looks really sleek and has premium look.\n\nThe real disadvantage of this phone is it's small battery, it does have support of fast charging for which you will have to purchase adapter separately, so if you want an iphone and your budget is around this phone only, you can go for it, with the option of fast charger. Otherwise go for iphone 11.",
            "Honest advice : Don't watch any tech reviewer's videos before buying this beast.\n\nI purchased this product on 6th June,2020 and here is my honest review :\n\n1. Device looks small but the way it works is truly amazing.\n2. if you are switching from ~6\" screen , it is going to be troublesome for a while.\n3. 1821 mah battery . 0 to 100% charging time is around 130 minutes. Fast charging/wireless charging is supported but fast charger is not included in box.\n4. Gaming Experience is amazing BUT playing on small screen , which is as small as 4.7\" is challenging. PUBG mobile can be played at HD extreme setting. Played for ~2.5 hours with 30% drain.\n5. Camera 12MP R / 7 MP F is decent combo. Low light photography not that great.\n6. Dual sim : 1 physical nano sim + Esim(at this point only Airtel and JIO are providing Esim facility in India).\n7. A13 bionic chipset is here to stay and will be supported by apple for next ~3 - 4 years, so updates will be available and device wont get slowed down.",
            "Been using it for almost a year now. I switched to this phone from Samsung galaxy a50 and it was really hard getting used to a 4.7 inch screen from a 6.4 inch one. However, with time i got used to the display and it feels just like any standard display. The display panel is 750p which would look blurry if the screen of this phone was bigger. As it has a smaller screen the pixels are packed close to each other which results in a sharp looking display. Coming to the battery life of this phone, it can last an entire day if you\u2019re not a heavy user. I mostly stay at home so i need to charge it two times a day and I don\u2019t use my phone much when I\u2019m outside. So you\u2019ll have 25-40 percent battery remaining when you get back home in the evening but I recommend to carry a power-bank with you if possible. The battery health of my phone has dropped down to 93 percent. I purchased this phone in October 2020 and it\u2019s 5th October as I\u2019m writing this review. The only way to slow down the battery health of an iphone is to not let the battery drop below 35-40 percent. I don\u2019t know if this happened with anyone else or not but when i go to sleep and the phone is idle, the battery drops 20-25 percent every night without even using the phone. Maybe it\u2019s because there\u2019s no network in my area and when there is no network, any smartphone tries to find network which results in battery drain. Now, the camera. I don\u2019t think i need to say much about the camera of this phone. I\u2019ll just say it\u2019s \u201cAbsolutely breathtaking\u201d. To get an amazing shot, all you need to do is get enough light that\u2019s it. While in indoor lighting the image quality is not too bad, it\u2019s fantastic in good lighting conditions. I would say it\u2019s the best camera in this price range. Now the performance. Again, not much to say. A13 Bionic is still a very powerful processor. Everything opens very quickly and the best thing about iphones is that the of the phone after a few years remains the same as day one unlike almost every android phone.",
            "I jumped from old SE to the new SE.the screen to body sized ratio is perfect for usage for a medium size palm.\nThe highlight of this product is it\u2019s elegance and sleek design.

But if u have decided to buy it then this product will bring a huge smile on your face in terms of speed, CAMERA, looks, iOS ecosystem and longevity of this device.\nBattery is one section of this phone which will disappoint you but as i don\u2019t play games this device is giving me 5-6 hrs of usage time (you tube, camera,music, browsing,etc etc)\nM using white colour with product red apple leather case. This is the perfect contrast with white colour.\nOverall rating-8/10\njust because of battery performance.",

I would say that coming from Android, there are some times when I feel that it is restricted in certain ways and you just have to accept it.\n\nComing to the phone itself, camera is amazing minus the low light photography part. Battery backup is ok ok. I bought 12W Apple charger separately which charges it pretty fast so I do not worry about battery being low. Also since I am mostly at home, it doesn\u2019t matter so much. Display is ok. Its a nice display but a small one and has huge bezels ofcourse. But good thing is you can reach the entire screen with one hand.\n\nOverall yes I would recommend it since iPhones have great value for money in the long run. It is very capable phone but if you play pubg or any heavy game, battery will tale a hit.",
            "Its a great product. Would have given more than 5 star for the performance. Camera quality is much better than 20MP . And it operates at lighting fast pace.

Battery drain very fast.(googled and made it battery efficient) now it last atleast 1.5 day with moderate usage.\n\nNote: i would not advice this compact super mobile for people who are always glued to social media and YouTube.\n\nThis is for someone who wants mobile as one time investment which can be used for atleast 7+ yrs",

            "Battery will give good performance for a normal user\nI suggest another variant for heavy users\nCam quality is good in day light conditions\nPerformance is very good with A13 Bionic chip\nSmall in size and don\u2019t expect a screen size like MI or one plus full screen mobiles",
            "Each and every Paisa you is worthy\nCamera section is a great upgrade\nPerformance is a beast\nIt\u2019s just a old design but still amazing design to hold in hand.\nI upgraded from old SE and satisfied to the core",
            "So fast as light classy premium look at affordable price thank you flipkart for easy delivery",
            "Loved it!\n12 MP single camera does its job better than many flagship camera phones. Very compact and perfect for single hand use. Battery lasts at least one day for a normal use.",
            "Best camera phone\nImage processing is best\nBest display and battery life is also best\nBest processor\nOverall best phone\nU can look after images also",
            "It\u2019s a beast in performance, only thing that I didn\u2019t like is it lacks night mode for low light photography. Battery backup is quite average only light to medium users can live with it, not meant for heavy users. It can handle each and every task very easily. Doesn\u2019t break a sweat no matter what you throw at it, whether a heavy gameplay or exporting/rendering of heavy videos. Fits perfectly in pocket as well as in hand. I\u2019ve been using it for more than 9 months. It is really a great device if you can live with the flaws mentioned above. And it\u2019s my first time experiencing ios, and it is extremely smooth and optimised.\nThanks.",
            "Speed is Awesome , high quality Camera with portrait mode , more handy than big screen mobiles, Premium look & design , sound quality is boom , very happy After purchase this",
            "This Phone is Simply Brilliant.The fastest mobile processor from Apple, A13 bionic chip can tackle any task without breaking a sweat. The CLASSIC Design is the reason to buy this phone as it is so easy for one hand operation. Camera performance and Battery backup has been improved significantly over the predecessor. Definetely a Value for your Buck.",
            "Best model if you wish to enter the Apple ecosystem. Flawless product and seamless experience. I love this phone.",
            "Hey iPhone lovers. If you like small phone you'll love it. A13 performed like a beast. Performance is top notch. If your budget tight, then go for it. You never disappoint after use it. And Apple iPhone security is best.",
            "It\u2019s not good product ...it\u2019s cost is more quality is not good every time is hangout..battery consumption is more at least half day also not get in ...finally my best suggestion is choose another one...",
            "Excellent phone from Apple... Almost same like iPhone 7 and 8 with latest processor. I can feel the speed very much compared to the iPhone 6s. It\u2019s awesome budget phone from iPhone family.",
            "It's a good phone for who like handy phones. But when its come to battery backup it's a worst thing. Performance of the phone is good",
            "Performance is top notch, battery is full day easily after disabling background app Refresh ( it doesn\u2019t effect any functionality) and some other tweaks. Camera is fantastic overall value for money if you get this in offer.",
            "Amazing phone, loved it, only issue is gets hot too much and too early. Otherwise a very good buy",
            "This is good phone for someone who never used iphone yet but of someone using/used any one of iphone 6 , 7 and/or 8 then there is no much difference between the features except performance. With the provided features the price is too high for this phone. If someone is looking for upgrading then I would strongly suggest you to go for iPhone XS or later versions. This is completely my own opinion and please read other reviews as well before making a decision to purchase this product.",
            "Let's face it. The main reason you're even considering this is because you want a compact phone that doesn't compromise on power. Getting OS updates for another 4-5 years, with a decent camera, waterproofing and wireless charging is just an added advantage.\n\nThere's a few things it could've done better:\n\n1. Battery is barely adequate for a day of moderate usage.\n2. The bezels could have been reduced to have more screen to body ratio.\n3. Night mode for the camera was a software feature that the A13 could smoothly implement.\n4. Fast charging\n\n....Among others.\n\nBut you knew all this already. It's been covered by almost every possible tech reviewer, news agency and social media platform. If you're still here in the reviews, you're just looking for a reason to justify the decision you've already made.\n\nIf you're taking the leap from an Android phone(or anything before an iPhone 8), and miss the portability that phones used to have, just go for it. You won't be disappointed. The learning curve of going back to a small screen is minimal.\n\nFor all the hate apple gets, it does know build quality (both hardware and software). The SE is no different.\nIt will last for at least 3 years with basic care. The phone will not slow down, it won't crash, it will still be as secure as it is today.\n\nIf you can afford the iPhone 11 now, or have the patience to wait for the iPhone 12 - Do it!\n\nBut if you want the nostalgia of simpler times, the performance of a flagship device, and are not averse to carrying a power brick/bank with you. This one is for you.",
            "For ppl who prefer small displays this is the ryt choice neat n clean top notch performance ......\nFOR THOSE WHO R CONCERNED ABOUT BATTERY\nThis has 1821mAh battery but combined with a13 chip efficency is top notch\n\n. Use 10W charger which comes with ipad or buy separately within 45 mins phone charger from 0-80% The 5w included in box is waste good for nothing\n\n. Switch off optimised battery charging under battery health settings so 80-100% will b charged quickly\n\n.I use social media apps like insta watsapp snap etc and 2hr YouTube avg throughout the the day and made calls through sim and whatsapp still its giving 7.5HR SCREEN ON TIME which is a good thing.\n\n.Video calling consumes more battery like every 2mins it\u2019ll consume 1%\n\n.Gamers will b little disappointed with this one coz PUBG mobile can finish a 100% charge in 2h40mins\nPEOPLE WHO DONT PLAY GAMES MUCH DONT THNK TWICE GO FOR IT ..PERFORMANCE IS ROCK SOLID",
            "Excellent phone , flawless performance\nThe massive upgrade for the user who are using the iphone SE ( 1 gen) just like me",
            "Well, the phone is small and looks nice. It's not for people who loves bigger ones. It's basically for those people who don't use their phones for everything.\nIt's fast.\ndesign is cool, sleek and beautiful. You will need a back cover for sure if you want to keep up it's beauty. P:)\nbattery life - not so good.\nvoice clarity is fine.\nI am not a gamer neither a photographer.\n\nBasically it;s a premium phone under budget so that you can say it loud - \" Hey! I own an Apple device\". If somebody is a hardcore user than it's not at all for you. But hey it's your money. :)",
            "Like It, Apple SE very nice and handy mobile, we can use it by single hand, like it too much if you are going single handy mobile you can go with Apple SE 2020 without any hesitation.",
            "Very handy and comfortable to hold. Best phone to buy if you want sleek design, powerfull processor, beautiful camera and that's fits in your pocket. I didn't hesitate while buying this phone instead of oneplus 8. Afterall its your choice whether you want a phone or a tab sized phone.\nP.S.- it's not that small.",
            "One of the best handsets, very easy to carry & handle. Exceptional performance & amazing display, however battery is the only concern. It consumes more battery when you use internet, especially streaming videos and also while taking pictures. Otherwise everything thing is perfect. People who don\u2019t like to carry big handsets on pocket can definitely go for this. But remember if you play more games or if u r always on internet you might need to carry a fast charger.",
            "Some might say overpriced in India, but below are the PROS and CONS after 3 days of usage:\n\nPros:\n1. Blazing fast processor. Runs everything thrown at it without a stutter.\n2. Very good single camera for daylight photography. Night time is good but not great.\n3. Optimal screen size for a phone for one hand use.\n4. Brilliant looks\n5. Battery life is one day when used like a phone. Watch various youtube videos to increase battery life. Optimal use of battery saver mode and screen brightness can always increase its life.\n6. Excellent speaker\n\nCons:\n1. This is not an entertainment device given the screen size, so use it accordingly.\n2. Battery life is about 1 day with use of social media , 4k videos and photography. Average Screen time around 5.5 hrs.\n3. Weak network reception. It loses network in places where other phones might still show 2 towers.",
            "Pros :-\n\n1. A-13 Bionic Chip....Beast in performance\n2. Best video camera phone under 50K\n3. Easy to hold, carry and one handed use\n4. RAM management is excellent\n5. Rear camera is good\n6. Output from speekers are too good\n\nCons :-\n\n1. Worst battery performance...4 hours hardly on a single charge\n2. Still you get 5W charger in the box... While phone's cost around 42.5k...but phone does support 18w fast charging..\n3. No night mode available\n4. Design is too old\n5. Frot camera is not up to the mark\n6. It drains a lot of battery in idle time..around 1% drain in 1 hour\n7. Screen quality and resolution is just average\n\nFinal verdict -\nIt's a good phone for those who are just casual users.",
            "Got it yesterday 11 June ordered on 30may seller shipped on 7 June\nWhat\u2019s happening Flipkart ?\nComing to the phone.\nI switched from my old Se .\nCAMERA: it\u2019s just Awesome in every way but those portraits lighting effects are of no use obviously mostly they won\u2019t be used by anyone\nBATTERY: it\u2019s just average it only remains for 6 to 8 hours of moderate usage\nDISPLAY: coming from four inch screen to 4.7 I feel like it\u2019s huge and fair enough ( I always prefer compact phones )\nTouch ID : it\u2019s way faster than Face ID I guess coz you need not to look into it it will be opened if you placed your finger from the pocket itself. And it\u2019s no longer a button like the old Se it\u2019s a sensor with gives the haptic feedback\nAnd yeah the product RED is an eye catching one !",
            "I switched from iPhone 8 to iPhone SE instead of going for iPhone 11 since SE comes with same power and great camera with a device size I can easily use and hold in my single hand. I got this delivered within one day of being available in India and it\u2019s just great. I am a big fan of iOS and I\u2019m deep into the Apple ecosystem with my iPad, MacBook, AirPods and an old iPod and I\u2019m not disappointed here too. To those of you who are wondering how is it different from iPhone 8 since it practically looks the same, so some points for you\n- the Apple logo at the back is bigger and the in the middle of the phone (that is logo position has changed)\n- the portrait mode!! I mean this is an amazing feature\n- the camera clarity- you may think the megapixel is same so the picture quality won\u2019t have changed but that\u2019s where you are wrong and the camera is way better and the pictures are real.\n- some new display screens have been added\n- it\u2019s way more powerful and faster.\n-brighter display\nTo those who don\u2019t want to shell a lot of money and yet enjoy this amazing world of iOS then do not hesitate as iPhone SE will make it fall in love with you.",
            "Pros\nClassy performance , sensitive touch , good sound quality , beautiful design , compact and comfortable,\nGood quality Camera, Battery backup is normal.\nCons\nPhone is overheating this is something not expected from APPLE Bit disappointing.\nSelfi photo click flips automatically so sometimes photos are weird. Wish there is a setting not to flip before foto click.",
            "Honestly best package from apple. Super handy. I don't like big phones. This phone is perfect for me and would definately recommend to everybody. If you compare antutu and geekbench scores with of iphone 11; this easily beats the iphone 11.",
            "Phone is very nice, but charger and earphone is not available in the box as I wish and I see in its video. It's not fair.",
            "Screen is really really small for media consumer and battery is not a full day usage battery other everything is fine and the camera is amazing overall a great deal with tons of value for money....",

            "In one word its Superb, Ignore negetive comments regarding Battery life,Its stays easyly a day for Ofiicial work Purpose.Build quality,Camera,Speaker Out put(Earpiece and Phone speaker)is top notch and apple airpod is just cherry on top..i have switched from 6 inch display to this phone not at all any issue.super smooth ios a big thumps up!\n\noverall its a fantastic gadget.",
            "13 MP Back Camera More Better than 64mp camera phone's and 7MP Front Camera Same as that.\n1845 Mah Batter then any other 5000 mah Smartphones Battery\nmost precious part The Bionic13 Chipset in this price range just Awesome",
            "The Phone makes it a good compact phone to kick start you ios Experience. This being my second iphone after the 6S+ and this phone just being my secondary phone it has the solid reliability which i want. The battery standby is good but if a person in considering to use this phone as a primary device the battery wont last for the full day sadly. The performance is brilliant, no lags in the phone and camera is pretty solid in 2021 and can definitely see the camera hold up pretty good for another year or even two. The speakers are pretty nice and they are dual speakers for your info. Overall this phone is a worth purchase for the processor it packs inside and the worthy single camera",
            "Trust me its best phone under 30k or 40k , i bought it for 25k and i am sooo happy with it.",
            "The phone is amazing according to me.. just some cons r the battery life and the big bezels .. the small phone is all I needed .. and it feels so much secure in one hand.. i needed exactly this type of phone which i can use one handed and have the beast like performance.. previously i was using a 5 inch phone Nokia 3 so the shift according to size is giving the same feel.. one thing that bothering me is the keyboard\u2026 even its approx the same size phone but keyboard is too tight to type.. it will take time to adopt no doubt and the fingers are getting fatigued.. these are the cons only \u2026 the pros are ends thats the reason I bought this and i am more than happy ..",
            "Best iPhone in this price range.It can do almost everything an iPhone 11 can do and will get long support for iOS updates.Battery life is very good very few people know how to optimise the iOS according to their needs for battery usage. So I get easily a day of use, many people say heavy usage consumes battery life that's true for any smartphone even iPhone 11.",
            "1 Week after using the phone I am Simply Loving it!\nI did a lot of research and was confused in Iphone XR, SE 2020 and One plus 8\n\nIf you are Ok with older design/big bezels or looking for GREAT Camera in budget phone or moving from Android to IOS, this phone is best for you.\nCamera(Portrait in selfie mode), Build quality, A13 Bionic Chip, Compact design, latest OS(software support for at least 4 years) is simply Bang On!\n\nDowns :\nNight mode Camera quality is not good.\nBattery is not the best!\n\nThe Ups clearly overcomes the Downs.",
            "Amazing Performance. If you are upgrading from an android, don't expect the battery life to be better. But if you upgrading from an Iphone 6, 7 or maybe 8, you will feel the difference. You can experience the speed with the A13 Bionic Chip. Camera Quality has improved. The best part is it's price. In this price you are getting a compact Iphone 11 Pro.\nIf you are looking to own an Iphone, you should 100% go for this.",
            "First of all let me tell you I am an Android user from years and still love it. The purpose to buy an iPhone was to switch for a new eco system and to experience it. It\u2019s been only 4 days of using this device and here are my initial impressions.\nPros:\nFits in the budget.\nHandy device.\nCamera and display are awesome.\nGood network connectivity.\nLatest iOS update.\nGreat build quality ( its glass back so be carefull )\nPerformance is great.\nCan handle almost everything.\nAnd yes it\u2019s an iPhone!\nCons:\nBattery ( but still gives you an entire day with minimal to moderate usage)\nScreen size\nFront camera\nNo Face ID\nAverage sound quality.\nI will update this after one month of usage.\n\nSo this is after one month of usage:\nGreat balanced ram\nBattery is okayish if u are a moderate user, keep a power bank if u are travelling.\nCamera could have been better as it lacks low light photography.\nOverall it\u2019s a great buy!!",
            "Breathtaking. Smooth Performance. Amazing Camera and video performance. Dual Sim. Smooth Networks. Ideal for first time Android users, who are doing the switch. Battery Backup is decent. Will last for a day, for a moderate user. Buy it for the A13 Bionic. You won't regret.",
            "Good for normal use like browsing and not recommended for gaming because of small screen size,overall a good product from apple.",
            "Writing this review after almost 3 months of usage. This is my first iPhone\n\nI got this delivered on 1st October 2021. The packaging was good.\n\nComing to the device, I\u2019m currently running iOS 15.2\nPROS :\n1) Superb build quality\n2) Touch ID is blazing fast\n3) Camera is very good, especially for videos\n4) Signal reception very good\n5) Earpiece volume for call is one of the loudest I have seen\n6) Wi-Fi calling support with Airtel, Jio and Vodafone Idea (Tried in Mumbai and Maharashtra circle)\n7) Wi-Fi signal reception one of the best I\u2019ve experienced\n8) Excellent performance from the A13 Bionic Chip, no lags, no heating issues.\n\n\nCONS :\n1) The only major con is the battery life. Hey, don\u2019t get me wrong here. The battery life is not pathetic, you might just need to charge it twice a day on moderate to heavy usage. On average usage, it will easily last you 1 to 1.5 day.\n2) The screen size might be a con for some, but this depends on the person, so I won\u2019t count it as a con.\n3) Charger should have been provided in the box\n\n\nConclusion - if you are new and want to experience iOS ecosystem without spending much on the then expensive iPhone series, you should definitely go for this phone.",
            "Firstly you all need to understand there is a crowd in this Huge Market for whom the ONLY THING WHICH MATTERS IS COMPACT SIZE. And probably phone companies are unable to understand this consumer behaviour. This market was not catered by any other company except to an extent by Google Pixel. Please remember each and every consumer who buys this phone is buying Primarily for its compact size. The dimensions are amazing, which overrides any other shortfall of the device such as battery, Screen size, etc. The price is for Size and Brand of Apple and yes A13 Bionic chip permformance. Many other brands will start entering this segment . Now in future whichver company brings similar size phone with better feature would rule that segment. Small or Compact phone industry will be having some fixed industry parameters such as Width less than 68mm, Thickness less than 7.5 mm etc. Yes screen size could have been improved within the same dimensions. But Apple or any other company will surely overcome this in new phones. People want to get rid of Bulky devices. Hands are mostly busy while driving, commuting, working. People want mobilty to operate a device with a single hand. Thats the LUXURY for which you are going to pay. Taking out a device from pocket shouldnt be a two hand game or a game which requires a lot of effort. People want COMFORT. That is the price , That is the Feature for which you are paying hefty. Design also comes with a price. It is not always whats inside the phone. Apple has brought this device after a long global research. Indian Consumers wont take this device happily is a known thing. I have seen so many wrong comparisons by many well known YouTubers. You cannot Compare this device with Samsung A51 or OnePlus 8 just because they are priced similar. There is no competition for this device as of now. Closest would be Samsung S10e and the Upcoming Google Pixel Device.",
            "It's easy to hold, looks good but slippery one. Performance is good. Battery is below average. If you turn off mobile data and use wifi then battery goes little more time. Back camera good in day light only. Front camera just ok ok. Someone who only use for mail, chat then its ok. Better go for iphone 11.",
            "First of all thank u apple for making such good phone.\nGuys this phone is Powerhouse with best processor.\nCamera is too good in light, I mean best, but don\u2019t expect great pics in night.\nBattery life is good according to size and display of phone, keep one fast charger with u and forget about battery issue because there is no issue with battery if u are not a hardcore gamer. It gives u full day with battery with moderate use. Charging in 30 minutes with 12 watt charger is 50 to 60%. I guess very fast it is.\nGaming beast, superb display, smooth, forget bezels it\u2019s apple phone.\nSuperb speakers.\nOverall in this price range it is worth buying. Again I tell u if u have a fast charger, battery of this phone is great.\nFeels premium in hand and very easy to use with one hand.",
            "It is a very good device. You will feel how premium is it whenever you hold in your hand. It is very nice to hold. And size is just perfect! Above all it has the best camera. See the attached picture which I clicked in the evening.You should go for the red one!",
            "I have been an android user since the beginning! I have used phones like poco f1 which had the flagship chips at their time but honestly speaking the performance on this device is just out of the competition! I was very skeptical by some bad reviews on internet, but to my very frank opinion it exceeded my expectations! Some things to keep in mind :\n*This phone has not so big display and only supports upto 720p videos on YouTube, so if you watch YouTube all day and love big screens it\u2019s not the device for you, if you occasionally get time to watch youtube and are a working person then this phone is one of the best in class.\n*No 3.5mm headphone jack, only lightning connector and included apple earphones which I thought are average but they blew my mind as soon as I listened to them! Much better audio than any android device at that range, plus stereo speaker\n*IP67 rated so sweat, dust and water resistant\n*This is a dual sim device but only one physical sim and one eSIM! Now frankly eSIM is awesome to use! I use single sim but still I converted my sim into eSIM and there\u2019s no physical sim inside my phone now! Very easy! Just a message and you\u2019ll get a barcode just scan that in add mobile data plan in settings and your eSIM will be activated within 2 hours!\n*THE BEST THING ABOUT THIS PHONE IS ITS CAMERA! It has a single camera but this price worth every penny of the camera! Amazing Dynamic range and colours! Beautiful! Front camera is good too, nothing exceptional! So if you\u2019re a selfie freak this might not be right for you! And video recording in this range no phone comes near in quality of this phone!\n*Battery life on this phone is better than average! I use my phone 24x7 atleast for social media and it\u2019s giving me 5-6hr of SOT and all day battery life! But if you watch YouTube and fb videos all day long or use Camera a lot then you might have to charge it\n*many people debate about its 3gb ram, but I have used 8gb ram phones in past and this 3gb ram phone is better in ram Management than 8gb ram android phones!\n*the touch ID or Fingerprint sensor is the best ever fingerprint sensor I\u2019ve ever used, Apple really show their quality in their products, much more secure than stupid face unlock of android devices and better and faster than in display fingerprints too!\n\n\n\nSo who should buy this phone?\nIf you\u2019re a person who doesn\u2019t require that edge to edge full view display and just a brilliantly built device with Atleast more than 4 year of upcoming software updates then it\u2019s for you! It has brilliant camera, it has water resistance, stereo speakers, NFC, fastest performance for the price then go for it!",
            "Best product but apple could have launched it in very less price.\nScreensjze comparatively small\nBeterry performance satisfactory\nCamera extra ordinarily\nSensors and apps way fast and results jn blink\n\n\nBuy if price around 25 max",

Also no fingerprint\n\nSo I chose the next best thing and I don't regret it for a sec.",
            "I was aware of that this is a fantastic phone except the battary life before purchase. But I have specific use case as follows\n1. I use it as business phone with lots of phone calls during a day.\n2. I do not have social media presence. Even the whatsapp is not installed. (I have whatsapp on second phone which I keep it at home and it works on home wifi). I only use imessage for close family members.\n3. It has all my business outlook email, calender, notes, Gmail is configured to inbuilt apple mailbox. Half a dozens of all my banking apps installed.\n4. Had realme buds air which works so seamless with this phone. Earlier i was using them with samsung A50 and thought they are just copy by looks and I stooped using them as there were many connection issues. Now I can understand why people praise so much about apples Airbuds. I receive the call on phone and open the flap of realme buds air and it gets connected automatically in less then 2 seconds. It was a super pleasant experience.\n5. I am getting more than full day of a battary life even after starting a day with about 85 to 90%. I try to keep battary charge between 20 to 90%\n6. I have a PD fast charger in car which can really top up about 50% in my 20 min run to and from office.\n7. I always wanted a compact and reliable phone which I can count on.\n8. Additional plus points are superb built quality, awesome in hand premium feeling and a terrific camera.\n7. In nutshell, it works extremely well for \"ME\". It will work for u in you have similar use case.",

Doesn't sound like much of a delay but it becomes a lot when u have a flight coming close and flipkart says your product will be delivered before 10th August. Like I could see clearly the phone is close to me (has reached my nearest hub). Now coming to the phone the display could've been better considering the price, but it's not a bummer by any means. The only downsides I see is the screen size and clarity of the screen. There could be 2 cameras but it rocks with one and can easily beat some of the biggest flagships in the market. The phone is a must have. I shifted to this phone after I brought the iphone 11. So trust me it's a great buy. Just don't trust flipkart when you're on a tight schedule.",

Camera too works way better than comparable 12MP devices.\n\nBattery lasts full day for normal usage including couple hours of youtube videos.\n\nGreat work Apple.",
            "Marking the return of the phone with great performance in a small form factor, this one does make it easy to love it.\nA well priced proposition with bang for the buck performance and the iOS level of confidence.\nThe battery is only average but that can also be improved if you are a little more aware, than the commonwealth, of the system software customisations.\nAll in all a good phone with a great performance and a decent battery life.",
            "A device that will last for atleast 5 years with the latest softwares at your disposal. A camera you can always trust about its consistency. Very compact . Battery is good, no matter what people say, if you are not gaming or not shooting videos for hours and hours, battery is solid with exceptional standby. Last but not the least, Flipkart was amazing with its services. At every stage. Thank you",
            "Well what can u expect from a 30k iPhone. Normal battery, nice camera but don\u2019t go for se if you\u2019re just going for camera cuz even if it performs well, you\u2019ll see how it fares in low light and the front camera oh the front camera. It\u2019s not bad but it\u2019s not good either. Or is it just me? Cuz I see mine a lil bit grainy and not like super clear. I know it\u2019s just 7mp but well. I compared it with an 11 and a 12. Let\u2019s just say big bros gave it a beating. Overall good phone. But small screen and battery. If u can wait, you can just buy a used 11 or an XR when a sale happens cuz that\u2019s more value for money. Trust me, u won\u2019t regret waiting. I\u2019m gonna upgrade from this Se in 1 and a half year so no biggie for me. But for long term usage, go for an XR or an IPhone 11. Or u could go for 12 mini if all you\u2019re looking for is a compact beast of a phone. Anyways, you should buy it and also you should not. Just depends on a personal point of view.",

            "The best budget iPhone you can get.\n\nThe camera: great for daylight images, only downside I would say is the lack of night sight, but yeah it does the task. Performance: I will certainly be joking if I said I was experiencing issues with the phone\u2019s performance. It\u2019s A13 for god\u2019s sake. The best processor in the market right now and I feel this is the reason most of us are buying. This phone is gonna last you more than any android in the same price segment will ever do. And that includes One Plus as well.\nDisplay: The Display is more than adequate. U might go for a fancy refresh rate on an android but trust me if u are a casual user u will not be disappointed with this device.\nBattery: it\u2019s 1850 mAh so yeah got me through like 10hrs of regular use with still 15% left. Heavy gaming does drain it in 3 hrs or so. But yeah if u want a phone which lasts long on battery go for an android else buy this eyes closed.",

In fact given it's processor which is the same as one in iPhone Pro which costs more than a lakh plus Apples' updates thay go on for 5-6 years, it's probably better value than most \"cheaper\" phones out there.\n\nThe camera is great and Touch ID in this age of mask wearing is perfect.\n\nCons - battery isn't as good as larger phones but with screen at lower brightness and decent use I can easily manage the day. Bezels make screen smaller, but I am ok because I use an iPad mini for videos and reading.",

It contains everything, yes its display is bit smaller but you don\u2019t feel if you are comfortable with small phones. The A13 chip set is playing its best role.

Good effort by Flipkart during such challenging times.\n\nThe looks and feel of the phone is a class apart compared to other Android phones I have used in the past. The colour is awesome and hard to take your eyes off. The Product RED written at the back adds to its esthetic.\n\nIt is easier on the grip being smaller and even with a back cover, it's more in control than the larger ones. The box contains phone with charger and headphone.\n\nThe sound is much louder and more soothing. When making calls you can hear with ease even a noisy places. The display being smaller comes with its disadvantages when reading mails or typing for longer durations, though the auto spell prediction works with complete ease. You can feel the power of IOS over Android at every moment when using the device be it while viewing videos on WhatsApp or scrolling through content.\n\nTo summarise it's a must have if you want ease and comfort of using a smaller mobile.\nThe build and quality speaks volumes about Apple.\nThanks to Apple and to Flipkart for the HDFC bank discount and choice of colours.",

Basically if you using your mobile phone only for official purpose that means Sending Emails, Using for Whatsapp and other messaging facilities, Using for Banking related applications then blindly go for it.

Buy a apple certified charger from anker or beikin or for cost saving go with mi 18w chrager, with 18w charging as the battery is small in capacity but effective it charges fast enough just charge for 30 mins when phone is still with 20% left and you could get near to 80 ,. Im a power user i got screen on time of 4 \u00bd hours , 1\u00bd hour gaming, 2 surfing through web and 1 hour of surfing through Flipkart as this os the festive season.\nCamera is good enough for the price don't expect flagship level performance, as i came from pixel 2xl the camera experience is little downgrade for me.\nSpeakers are great the quality is top notch just like iphone 11 or 11 pros,\nGo for this if you want a sleek small and effective iphone which does all the things we want perfectly without any enthusiastic features,\nAnd bye the way ios 14 update is soo cool .\nYou can buy this even for the mrp of the phone without hesitation .",

It\u2019s so smooth can set the graphics option to ultra.\nSo\nThis phone is compact powerful phone with lot of advantages\nOnly draw back is small screen and very less battery.\nBut for me small screen it\u2019s not the problem once u get used to it it\u2019s very convenient to put and pull out of pocket and on the go.\nHope you\u2019ll find it useful.",

Nothing beats it, throw any game at it and it will run them without any degradation in performance.\nBattery: most disappointing part of this device is its battery. It gives almost 5.5 hours of screen on time on casual use. You can\u2019t play games on this battery without putting it on charge(max 2.5 hrs of pubg). Heavy users should consider buying XR or lighting extension for simultaneous charging and earpods.\nThe wireless charging is very convenient.",
            "Very nice phone with compact phone factor, price is little bit more , but i got this on 36649rs. Battery is not too bad, if u are not hardcore hame, all over very nice phone with super fast processor",
            "A phone only for selected people for size and handy use and dual sim requirement or else you can go for other models\n\nVery fast delivery thank you Flipkart and seller New brand pack sealed price recorded unboxing video all things ok warranty ok buying MI wireless power bank having wireless charging and fast charging also",
            "Wonderful camera\nBrilliant speed\nGood battery life of 6 hours continues usage... better than iPhone 7 and iPhone 8\nOverall go for it.. it\u2019s best iPhone you can get at this price.",
            "The iphone SE performs in a great way when it comes to camera quality and it's Speed. The camera captures stunning images and the pictures come out to be very natural. The camera can be easily compared with the likes of iPhone xs series and 11 series . The phone is very swift and performs all the tasks very smoothly. The only concern about this phone is the battery performance. The battery drains out quickly as compared to other iphones. It could be because of the very\npowerful processor and low mah battery. Although iPhones have a great reputation of RAM management and battery optimisation, but this is not the case in iPhone SE.\nOverall it's a good buy who wants to have a powerful processor and can also compromise on the screen size.\nDue to the small screen this phone is very comfortable to hold and easily fits into the pocket. But you have to compromise with the screen size as now a days many prefer to have a big screen size phones for media consumption and other routine tasks.\nIf you want to be in the apple ecosystem and can live with the average battery and small screen size then you can definitely go for it.",

Only go for it if you do not large screen phone.\n\n\nCamera is not bad, descent 12MP Shooter\nTouchId on the iPhone is the best\nScreen and brightness is appropriate\nFront shooter is nice\nOnly thing that I dislike is battery\nYou would love the Processing of A13 bionic chip",

Compact and handy with a lot of powerful features.\nBest camera, classic look, powerful processor and of course an Apple product which is a style statement.\nBattery is very good. Efficient for 1 day usage. Don't go with the negative reviews, just experience the iPhone. Worth it.",
            "Pros :\nCompact design\nDisplay\nCamera\nSound\n\nCons :\nPerformance decreases after a month use, lags observed.\nNo charger/adapter\nTough to use keyboard/type due to compact size(but great in every other sense)\nBattery doesn't last even for 24hrs for normal usage.. My observations(Instagram,YouTube, Whatsapp, Calls) if only for this then expect around 18-20hrs... If gaming then expect less than 10hrs..\n\nHeats up when charging..!!!\n\nNothing is perfect, buy it only if u r a normal user else consider other option tbh..!!",
            "Bought it because I wanted a small phone with all features. After five months of usage, I find this phone to be a power packed super horse.\n\nVery fast processing, no lags whatsoever.\n\nDecent battery backup. With a total screen time of about 4 hrs a day with Bluetooth, WiFi, dual sim and location always on, the battery lasts a full day.\n\nEasily fits into the hand. Upper bezel could have been shorter to make it more smaller. Best option for people like me who don\u2019t like big screen phones.\n\nTouch, fingerprint sensor, gps, compass all work very smooth without any glitches.\n\nAn awesome choice.",
            "Camera- 4.5/5 (However if it had dedicated night mode i will give it 5 out of 5)\nPerformance- 5/5 (A13 Bionic chip is powerful enough to handle any kind of task)\nDisplay- 4/5 (Super color accurate display, but if it have 800 nits of brightness then it will get 5)\nBattery- 2.5/5 (Battery is the weakest point of this phone. Although the standby time is great but in very light use i get 4.5 Hours of SOT)\nSoftware- 5/5 (Since it is a apple device so you will get ios updates for long period of time)\n\nOverall Its a great phone and it has an awesome build quality. Since the battery is not great i will not recommend this phone to a power user. And if you are looking for a secondary phone under 30k or you are a very lite user then go ahead and buy this phone. (In Big billion days you can get this phone under 25k)\n\nOne more point many Youtubers are saying that is has a very small display, but believe me guys i am using this phone. I can feel that is have a smaller display but not very small. But if try to play PUBG or COD then only you will feel that the display is small.",
            "A very great phone for the price. I got it for 24,000 in the sale. The delivery was on time, the box was not at all damaged. A genuine product from apple and flipkart.

            "This is my first IPhone. I am really happy with this purchase. The camera quality is nice. The performance is amazing. The battery life is sufficiently good. It comes with tons of amazing features. This product was released at the right time when I broke my phone. And I am really happy that iPhone came up with a budget flagship.",
            "After using iPhone 5s, 6, 6s, 8 and Xr I think I am qualified enough to say that this phone is the best value for money iPhone has ever launched. The processor is super fast, there are not a host of features on offer, but whatever has been provided is top notch. This phone is certainly for those who are not looking for big size phones, which is the trend nowadays.",
            "I have been an android user since last 10 years and recently switched from my Samsung Galaxy S7 ( which I was using since 4 years) to the iPhone SE 2020 .\nThe phone is perfectly sized . It feels comfortable in my hands and in my pants( pocket) .It is sleek, thin and looks good . I am used to the big bezels.\nThe camera is good . I have been stuck at home and I shoot random stuff at my home and the camera has delivered well . The videos are better .Very clear , stable.\nThe performance is top notch . It\u2019s been just a week and few days and it\u2019s been a smooth ride\nThe battery life is fine by my standards. I charge in the evening every day to 100% and I am left with 20-30 % after 24 hours when I put my phone to charge again.\nThe charging however is slow. It takes more than 2 hrs to charge from 25-100% . I do not charge the phone overnight.I do not play any games on my phone but I use it for email,texting , phone calls (about an hour a day max) occasional camera usage, and a lot of YouTube .Screen time per day is around 2.5 to 3 hours.\nThe call quality is good. Voice on both ends is clear and the speakers are clear and loud.\nWiFi reception has been good and have not noticed any issues\nThe iOS experience has been good so far . So far, I have not been limited by any of the software features . I could do everything that I used to on my android phone. The apps and overall experience is similar to what I was getting on my android\n\nOverall, the phone is a good buy and I hope it lasts me for a few years",

            "So after using the phone for 12 months straight here\u2019s my long term review for this device -\n\nFirst w the pros -\n1) top notch performance\n2) best phone if u wanna enter the apple ecosystem\n3)premium feel\n4) great cameras\n5) can use it for 2-3 years straight because of the apple software the support\n6)wireless charging/ fast charging compatibility\n7)water resistant\nCons - 1)small display\n2)huge bezel\n3) battery life is v bad of this device\n4)heats while using\n5) no dedicated night mode but u can use an app that is available on the App Store for 400rs which can do wonders at the night time \ud83e\udd29\n\n\nIn short if I conclude everything I can say if u wanna use this phone as your secondary device then go for it because the battery backup is not so good and u have to charge it 2 times a day minimum and I would suggest to buy a 20W charger w it ( I got 5w in box and ik u wont be getting it now )\nBut keep this in mind that the battery health will degrade faster w the 20w compare to the 5w.\nThank you \ud83e\udd0d\nSome camera samples that may help y\u2019all \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb",
            "I simply loved the phone and honestly this size is perfect for me!! Though honestly speaking the battery is not so good but yes if you\u2019re not a heavy user it\u2019s not a big deal however the video quality is superb and it always feels premium to even use it!!! So if you are looking for something cheap but useful go for this! It\u2019s worth that money except for the battery but I have a fast charger so it charges quickly!",
            "My expectations for a mobile phone were simple: 1) Need to have good call clarity 2) Should be handy 3) Good enough camera quality to capture memories 4) The battery should last at least 2 days.\n\nIn this quest, the best fit i found was Redmi 2 Prime mobile, it had all things matching. Later the mobile boom was phenomenal that all the points except Point \"2) Should be handy\" were met. The screen size of phones have increased manifold. My quest for handy had very few models if brand is also a criteria. The last handy mobile phone which was handy i had was Redmi 7a! To get a handy phone in Android was such a pain. I need to go for a lower configuration mobile phone to match the handy criteria.\n\nOn the other side, most of the Apple phones 6s, 7, 8 were too apt for the handy part! But, the battery was always an issue. Since, it was very much evident that Android phone makers are not going to consider the niche \"handy\" fans, went ahead and bought iPhone SE.\n\nIm using it for 3 weeks now. As mentioned earlier my use and expectations are minimal, iPhone SE outperformed all my expectations. The battery comes easily for 2 days with regular calls and WhatsApp usage. Even if the charge reduces, the battery gets charged from 19% to 70% ~ 10 mins with stock charger. Camera quality is very good. Camera has so many options, I didn't explore much. One important thing i liked is the ability to use Google Account to use favorite Google Apps in iOS. And iOS provides option to the user to let the user choose how an App should use location or other personal settings. In my experience these things can be controlled in Android as well, but Android won't push much for privacy.\n\nAll in all a good purchase, though the price is on the higher side.",
            "I am ISO user since last 5 years and upgraded with iPhone 5s>iPhone 6s>iPhone SE. I am highly satisfied with the product and features. Chip 13 gives me amazing results and experience.

Thank you Apple and Flipkart.\n\nSuggest to sell iPhones assembled in India to support Aatmanirbharbharat mission.",

            "This phone keeps up its promise.\nOne day battery life (last from 7 AM to 12 midnight under medium to high usage)\nBest camera\nBest performance, better than flagship android phones.\nGood display (i.e. perfectly done LCD display )\nGood audio quality\nBest network chipset awesome network reception\nReally a good buy, if anyone who reads this review has an idea about Oneplus Nord means here is my suggestion please don\u2019t buy it.\niPhone SE 2020 returns the most value for what we pay. Oneplus Nord is not a good choice.",
            "The phone is great and has snappy performance. Ofcourse iOS in itself is one of the most refined OS in the world(Android has too much fragmentation, app developers cant keep up, also Android Auto is super laggy too). Apple CarPlay works like a charm in my car. For anyone wanting to try an iPhone this is a great entry level phone.\nYes there are downsides to this phone. Namely screen and battery. I also own a Samsung Note 8, so the difference in screen resolution is evident. Note 8 has a SUPER AMOLED screen. For a 40k phone I think apple could have included a better display. Atleast a 1080p display.\nAlso battery is not the best on this one as compared to other iPhones. I have less issues since I am mostly at home or in my car and both places have access to a charging point. But people out on a field job will face the scarcity.\n\nAlso one huge huge downside. I am also an iOS developer. I have the latest 2020 16\" Macbook pro. But surprise surprise, you can't connect your latest iPhone to the latest Macbook out of the box. Apple it wouldn't hurt to include a USB A to USB C converter out of the box. Even Samsung does that. Luckily I was able to use my Note 8's converter, but I assume not everyone is that lucky all the time.",

Colour: Mine is red and very attractive in the real world also a sure shoot head turner, my next preferred colour in order would be white and black\n3. Processing Power: Be it heavy games like PUBG, Call of duty, Asphalt 9 or heavy image and video editors like Canva and Adobe run with breeze like charm Thanks to IOS and A13\n4. Camera: Way better than all the Android Cameras out there in this budget range my next best liked photo camera after Nokia\n5. Network reception: 4g volte on dual sim and Wifi6 technology gives me advantage than my peers in better and fast connectivity\n6. Wireless Charging and Waterproof features\n\nAreas if improvement:\n1. Need a fast charger to be shipped in the box instead of the standard one so the charging time can be reduced by 30%\n2. More colours like yellow, cyan, greens would be welcomed\n\nMyth bursted: Battery life easily last for about 8 hrs with heavy usage, 12 hrs on medium usage and 18 plus hours with basic usage as per my personal usage since past 4 days on different usage patterns\n\nMy personal suggestion: Go for the 128 Gb and above models if you have littles more more available at disposal as the 4k video recordings, Games, Apps, Movies downloaded on streams services like Prime, Netflix etc would not be a problem after 6-9 months of usage when you will find a need for extra space",

            "It\u2019s a great phone. I bought two phones for my parents. Now our entire family is under Apple Ecosystem, using every Apple products available in India. iPhone SE is same size like iPhone 7/8. Super smooth. Battery lasts for a day for sure with modestly heavy use. Screen is brighter than older versions of iPhones (6 or 7 or 8). Photos really good, natural. All the features of iPhone 11 put inside camera.\n\nRest like multiple personal or office mails, synchronisation with Apple TVs, Apple Watch or AirPods or even with iPads and HomePods like breeze. All social networking apps, home app (if you\u2019ve power control setups at home), Apple TV+, AirDrop, Family Sharing, Find My, Notes, Reminders, Shortcuts (even if you\u2019ve complex algorithms) works fluidic, just like gliding. Apple Music, Siri, though can be improved a lot, works fine with home app and homepods with controls from iPhone SE. Typing in Apple TV with apple remote (download apple remote) with iPhone SE is like cakewalk. Siri can even speak Hindi but Bengali not supported yet. My octogenarian parents are loving it.\n\nNot much difference in layouts or functionality if you\u2019re already using Apple Phone, must upgrade if you\u2019ve iPhone 6 or earlier but definitely much much better if you\u2019re migrating from Android. Migration from Android is like super easy and you\u2019ll not lose a single piece of your docs or photos or texts or contacts in any third party app.\n\niPhone is a must buy and would recommend to buy it from Flipkart availing offers.\n\nFlipkart delivery is very fast and packaging as usual good",

            "Keeping it short\nBest value for money, capeesh. Has its shortcomings battery(will get you 3.5 - 5.5 hours of screen on time depending on the usage, gaming is wonderful but due to its small battery capacity it does depletes fast, roughly around 2 - 2.5 hours on screen time) and camera(night mode doesn\u2019t support, although Apple can add it through software on due to its processing power but lack in a second camera don\u2019t let it do so). Other then that trust me you will enjoy it and get its money\u2019s worth. Since I am already in the Apple ecosystem of its variety of product\u2019s, the flexibility of moving device to device without hampering my work flow does have a advantage over its android counter parts; this is coming from a guy who has his whole life used android and windows as its primary os and has hands on both on phone and tablet segments.",

Supports fast charging which is a great feature if you buy a separate 18 W charger. Works great and handles every app very well still unfortunately there are very less apps that are supported by iOS and android.",
            "I love apple products\nI start using iphone from Iphone 4\nI used Iphone 4,4S,5,5S,Se 1st gen,6S and XR now Iphone Se2\ni missed using iphone 7, 8 so i love this size, in xr i face the difficulty is face lock actually face recognition is superb but the thing is during this covid situations we people are using masks so it\u2019s difficult to type passwords\nin this new gen iphone se i really happy to hear that fingerprint is back.\ncoming to performance its really amazing.\nBack camera is awesome\nSelfie cam is also ok\n\nif we people want a compact design i recommend Iphone SE",
            "An apple product worth the price, i always used to find apple exorbitant luxury but this one fits the bill and in that price you are getting to use an high end apple product. Also i love the small size fits right in the pocket and hand much better than carrying a tablet sized phone",
            "Using I phone 6s from 4year and upgraded to SE 2020\nScreen size is similar to 6S but feels more plush, speed is superb absolute no lag,\nI feel size of the phone is pretty decent for daily usage purpose,\nBattery life is also better one charge last long for a day,\n\nOverall value for money phone.",
            "I have used iPhone 5s, 7 and my last phone was 11 pro. I wanted something smaller, so decided to go with this.\nPros -\nCompact and premium.\nInsanely fast.\nDisplay is crisp and color accurate.\nLightweight (11 pro was heavy)\nBattery is good, 4-6 hours of screen on time depending on the tasks.\nWireless charging and water resistance.\n\nCons\n\nNot having an amoled screen.\nFragile glass body.\nNo Night mode.\n\nIt's perfect for digital minimalists, If you don't want to spend all your time on your phone.\n(Got the white 128 gb for 42k)",
            "Would recommend this mobile if you are the one who doesn't play many games, uses mobile for surfing/social media and occasionally for photography. Would not recommend if you are into huge screens and brighter displays. To sum up, iPhone SE is a 'no-nonsense mobile' with an average camera and battery life. Also highlighting its significance, I can say it is DAMN FAST, you will be amazed by its speed and fluidity which makes it worthy enough for the money.",
            "iPhone user since 5 years.\nPerformance wise very nice phone and sufficient as per my basic requirement.\nSecured device as compare to Android and compatible and very handy.\nBit disappoint in terms of battery performance.\n12MP camera is fine for phone purpose.",
            "This is my first iPhone and I am pretty happy with the device. Everything is okay with the phone but it would be much more better if it came with a bigger display and a higher mah battery",
            "It cant get any better.\nFor people who like compact phones like 6,6s, nd 7 this is the real deal and way cheaper. My last phone was iphone 7 for 60k back in 2016 nd this is next generation 7 at just 38,900\nJust amazing.. Performance is outstanding..",
            "this phone is great, if someone like small size phone then its great product for him.\nperformance is awesome really loved this apple product and also budget phone by apple.",
            "Awesome phone the only drawback is its battery life, did not last entire day even with moderate usage. Camera is amazing and A13 is awesome, lighting fast phone with decent screensize. Not recommended for gamers, professionals and moderate users should go for it.",
            "there,s nothing fancy in this phone, it,s simple and i love it... if you like compact and doesnt care much about battery, then go for it, A13 bionic chipset is waiting for you.\nit,s not phone for everyone, but if you regret after buying it, it will show that you haven't researched about the phone..",
            "Absolute beast of a phone - compact, portable and with an amazing camera paired to stereo speakers! Battery life is sadly the major drawback of this phone and so not recommended for people who expect higher screen on time. I find it suitable for our mothers and fathers who want something portable and easy to use from day one! I also found outdoor brightness of the screen underwhelming, struggling to read outdoors. But the phone makes up for its drawbacks for features such as: water and dust resistance, wireless charging, great camera, loud stereo speakers, fast processor, assured software updates for the next 5 years and dual sim capabilities.",
            "A perfect blend of nostalgia, perfect size and ergonomics combined with super top of the line specs but with some back dates stuff !\nOverall, a value for money Apple phone which will last you another 3-4 years, maybe more and will never let you down.\nBattery is a bit on the weaker side but with a 100% charge it will last you a bit more than a full day with normal to regular usage ( including phone calls,video calls, Youtube, OTT platforms, Social Networking sites and Camera. )\nGames play smo...\nREAD MORE",
            "Pros:\nVery good performance\nPhoto and video taking capabilities in good light is excellent\nBuild quality\nCons:\nLower battery capacity than older models such as Xr\nNo lightning to aux convertor in box\nLow light photos are very bad\nOther:\nThough the display specs are not top of the line it does meet the expectations. Sound quality is decent and does not disappoint.\n\nFinally:\nThe phone gives good value for your bucks. In my opinion it is a must buy if you want to try an iPhone for the first time or want a iphone in the cheaper segment without compromising on most features.",
            "Hey guys,\nThis my take on the iphone se. I purchased this phone for my mom, basically she needed a compact phone and who would have thought it would be an iphone.\nYes I do believe price is currently on higher side in india as compared to global market. But thanks to exchange and credit card offer I got it for 34k which I believe is a good deal.\nComing to the pros and cons\nPro\nCompact size\nHandles the apps very well thanks to A13 chipset.\nDisplay is overall good same as that one iphone 7.\nIn terms of design and looks it's ditto as iphone 7.\nCons\nOnly con I felt is the battery. It discharges quickly and doesn't last a day. Also just a 5watt charger takes a long to charge on an average 2hrs.\nIt does support wireless charging but you need to spend additional for it.\nAlso I am currently charging it with my ipad charger which is 10watt charger and it takes 1hr to charge completely.\nU can reduce the time by buying the 18watt charger as in the case of mine I am happy with the 10watt charger.\n\nOverall I am happy with the purchase so is my mom.\n\nNote- This ain't a device for someone coming from iphone 7 or later because it feels outdated from looks, design and display in today's era.\nRecommended to buy it only if your tight on budget or desperately need your first iphone.\n\nRegards",
            "Phone is good if ypu wish t ahift drom android and want a decent camera in your pocket. Defenetly not for gamers because processor Bionic A13 can take nay game with full graphics no prob but battery will disappoint you. Not for long video calls rest things are fine premium feel full display could have been better.\n\nIf battery and display is also important ro you consider XR or 11.",
            "Package is well packed . Got this phone in first sale itself and it's been 3 weeks . Performance is snappy and camera is pretty good. The only con is Battery life which barely lasts full day with moderate to heavy usage, but it is expected because of it's compact and light weight design. Other than that phone is good and price should be at least 10k cheaper then only price to performance ratio can be justified",
            "I love this product and thanks to flipkart for a quick delivery that I didn\u2019t expect that I got it before the delivery date that mention in the order list and i thank you to the delivery man that he took patience to wait till I paid the bill for this order. Once again thank you so much.",
            "iPhone SE here in 2020 boom it\u2019s powerful device low budget iPhone ever don\u2019t go on price phone is packed with performance running on A13 Chip which makes apps run butter smooth camera is good borrowed from IPhone 11 battery is smaller bcoz of the size of phone but does your job speaker is quite loud every phone has pros and cons so we have to deal with it overall it\u2019s good phone under budget go for it all three colour are amazing I have bought white",
            "other than battery all ok still 1800 mah battery lasting for 11 hrs with 5 hr screen time is great , battery casing will be awaited from apple , great for small and handy design lovers, battery is not ok",
            "The phone works just fine! Despite the negativity around the battery life (which is true, only if you want to want to play games).\nCamera is nice, display with True Tone feels just right and the performance is spectacular! After 3 years with Android (Google Pixel 2 XL) it was time to head back to iOS. Nothing against Android, that was a brilliant phone too, but too big for me. (Personal choice).\nI don\u2019t play games or watch movies/videos for prolonged duration. So a big screen just felt like an overkill. With Apple coming out with SE and the specs on offer, I thought it was the right time to switch back!\n\nOverall, apart from battery and maybe the top bezel, this phone is a no-nonsense phone.\n\nCheers!",
            "Performance is awesome with A13 bionic chip\nThose who capture a lot of pics it\u2019s a very good choice fir them... single camera but picture quality is giant....\nBattery performance is little bit of weak.. doesn\u2019t looks good.. for normal use it\u2019s ok.. but those who are heavy user for them doesn\u2019t look good....\nVery handy phone with a premium look... but the bazzels one the screen looks old..\nbut overall it\u2019s good to buy within this price range",
            "This phone is meant for niche market. Not for people who like screen size more than 5.5 or 6 inch. Was waiting for a product like this since long and now will experience this with the latest A13 bionic chip. Great buy for people who require smaller handy phones. Not for gaming purpose of course. You can buy a play station instead \ud83d\ude09.\nRegards",

            "It's my first iphone\nVery loud and good sound, that's the part that I enjoy the most, be it calls, music or movies...the sound is amazing. Nice display. Very smooth and fast, no lag obviously. Camera is good but not exceptional. The only con is the screen size, it has such a great gaming processor but I can't play coz of the screen size, the size also affects the camera resolution. The charger cable was faulty...so had to buy a boat charging cable.",
            "The iPhone SE 2020 is the most valuable and attractive phone of 2020. Cuz of it\u2019s pricing which is also having a great powerful A13 Bionic chipset. From past I am using this mobile, really I am not seen any lagging or issue regarding while using this smartphone. Cuz of Apple products are well optimised,least customised,it\u2019s eco system,power and it\u2019s design that\u2019s why I love Apple products",

Looking for a phone that is compact but with full features of flagship. 3. Although it is good for gaming but I will not recommend you to consider it for gaming.\n\nOnly concern:- battery capacity is not that great but if you do moderate use with social media and bit of youtube streaming.It lasts for a day. 11-12 hours outside.",
            "Bought and used this device for 24 hours. This is pretty good bargain for People who do phone calls and watch few videos. Battery holds good for a day if you don\u2019t push it. Don\u2019t fall for the battery drain and charge testing videos. Use a Samsung charger. It charges fast while not heating the phone.\n\nCamera is awesome and you don\u2019t have to be a pro to click some brilliant pictures and videos. You want an iPhone then go for it.",

            "Just an amazing phone, the interface is great there is no lag, the battery backup is also decent, and the camera quality is amazing the phone feels really premium and high quality, best choice go for it. Try buying the one with the charger and the earpods to save money",
            "I shifted from android to IOS, believe me the experience is good.\nDuring the initial stages, it will be difficult for android users but once you get use to it you will enjoy using IOS.\nComing to the phone, it is a very good phone at this price compared to all other phones available at the same price.\nThe camera is really very good as compared to the other 50 megapixels cameras available in the market.\nI am not a heavy user hence battery life is good for a day.\nAlso, the phone is not that big, it's light weight and can be operated with one hand.\nOverall good phone go for it.",
            "Honest Review after using for around 3 months and still using it as primary mobile.\nPros.\nAmazing Camera\nSpeaker is just too good.\nThe fluidic interface of apple which feels so smooth while using it.\nThe earphones given along with mobile phone in-box is just superb.\nCons.\n1. Screen size is bit small. You get used to it with time but when it feels awkward when you suddenly switch from some big screen phone to this.\n2. Battery life is not too great. Although with normal usage, my phone lasts whole day. Still a bigger battery would make it a must-buy phone.\nOverall, this is my first iPhone and am satisfied with it till now (touchwood). Good value for money( since I got it in Big Billion Day for 28k).\nGo for it guys specially if you are switching from Android to iOS for the first time.",
            "After using for a week, this phone is working really upto expectation. Bought in 33K for 128gb variant along with charger and earpods. If you want a powerful chip along with large storage space and also a touch of apple, then this is the phone. PS: Black looks amazing and classy when comes to Iphone",
            "I buyed it in Dasara sale at 24999/- as per I spend I bought a very very nice phone.Below 28000 it is a best compatible phone.",
            "I bought this mobile as a replacement for my mother's age old iphone 5S, as she was stuck with IOS & single home button. I'm really surprised with its great performance and features. Felt like buying it for myself too. But its battery is not so great for working people. To sum it up, very good mobile for this price bracket.",
            "Battery backup is good, using it for last 2 weeks and it works for 24 hours for me in moderate usage. Camera is better than most of high end Android phones. I dint like notch display thus went for this one and I like the phone more than IPhone X and 11.\nI don\u2019t like heavy and big size so it fits my need and performance is top notch.",
            "It\u2019s everything i expected it to be. In a market where thick heavy and monster sized smartphones are ubiquitous, this is a life saver for people like me who just want a thin and light smartphone that\u2019s also easy to hold with one hand without compromising on performance. I have a gripe with modern mid range phones that are packed with 4 cameras but still take awful photos. This phone takes good photos with the limited range of its single camera, and I much prefer this. As for the battery, it\u2019s adequate for me since I am not a so called power user. Easily lasts a day.",
            "It's pretty good but battery decrease too fast nd a good product",
            "I purchased this iPhone for my dad because of his requirements of small sized phone with decent performance and capable camera. This is the ideal phone for these requirements. He is pretty satisfied with the phone. My only complaint is 5 W Charger. After all it's cost over 40k.",
            "First off all what a fantastic delivery flipkart made. I ordered the phone on 9th July 5:20 PM. Received the the phone on 10th July 9 Am.\nNow coming to the phone. Its already been reviewed by many tech reviewer nothing more to say.\nPerformance is great. Battery part is ok. As u have to compare the battery with iPhone 7 and 8. Not with XR or iPhone 11.\nOne thing I did not like was there were no first charger only 5 volt charger is packed.\nOther then that it's a great purchase.\nIf it's your first IPhone then go for it u will not be disappointed.",
            "My first ever Apple product.\nIt's small, snappy, has Touch Id (Apple pioneered in it).\nI am astonished as to how such a small phone can outstand every other phone.\nReasons to buy:\n1. Camera (Don't get fooled coz of one lens)\n2. Performance (A13 bionic chip)\n3. Screen (Small and reachable by single hand)\n4. Power packed features (4K-60fps, water resistant, A13 chip, more secure touch ID, wireless charging, quick charging)\n5. Price\nCons:\n1. Outdated look.\n2. Battery is very small although it lasts a decent amount of time.\n3. Display is HD.\n4. There are other phones in the segment which have double the features.\n\nPro tip: Buy the 128Gb version as it is the sweet spot (5k extra than the 64Gb)",
            "Fantastic product super fast speed no lags like android phones no advertisements fabulous response to touch good battery life there is this wrong saying that battery life is not good",
            "This is more of my legal first iPhone. Been using borrowed ones or sticking with android this whole time.\nComing from the world of android, my first word to describe iOS is \u201ccool\u201d. Bye bye heat issues from android phones. Believe me I tested this phone to enormous stress but still there\u2019s no heat issues.\nMy old Samsung note 8 didn\u2019t boil that much but my one plus did. And bye bye blotwares.\nRegarding this phone, chick to carry. Enough screen space to read e-books, see movies.\n\nBut adding media to view is like going from chennai to Delhi and back.i hard tough time updating my PC and then get approved iTunes and get media stuff.\n\nThe ear phones are the best. But it\u2019s better to get Spotify or Apple Music subscription. Apple Music though 99 per month is worth it.\nWaiting for AirPods to pair up with.\n\nCalls are impressive.\nThis is the phone for basic telephony.\n\nAnd battery life, I felt draining was not like my old note8. But still not a marathon runner. This phone Holds more juice in standby than androids, I feel.\n\nOn the whole, it\u2019s like a new cool luxury car to drive with. Have to see the performance in the long run.",
            "I have using iPhone XR except of the screen size\nEvery thing is great about this phone se 2020\nSpeak about battery it\u2019s far better compare to iPhone 8\nThe new processor is helping a lot and fast enough\nSmall in size",
            "This is my first apple phone, previously I was using OnePlus 3T.\nUpgrading from android to IOS was a tough decision since I was getting the latest oneplus 8 in the same price range with offers.\nHowever I stuck with my decision of upgrading to IOS since I have found that IOS technology is better than android phones.\nOnly CON with Apple is the battery. The battery runs out pretty fast.\nWell that is something I miss, nothing else.\nGreat phone, slim and very fast. cheers!!",
            "I would like to say only one thing iPhone rocks. The stereo sound quality is just at par with other phones in this range. Connect to your external HPs or soundbars and your are ready to rock and roll. Deep bass level are so clear u would fall in love with this. I really don\u2019t mind bulky bezels because that is what makes this handy and your very own and personal phone. It\u2019s a powerful beast in a small size. :)",
            "Tremendous purchase and awesome device . First of all it\u2019s as per the latest lifestyle like 2 sim option and in a pocket size at such a great price. I am very happy and satisfied.",
            "One of the best thing about this phone is its Apple A13 Bionic processor speed. You can buy a phone with 20000/- of another brand with high RAM capacity but no one focuses on processor benchmark number. Lightning speed in a small pack of phone is very satisfying and really good for working people who want to make a fast call, want to check WhatsApp quickly etc. The camera is also very good for the given specs and takes video with 4K resolution.\n\nI highly recommend this phone for people who are very busy with a full-day work schedule and need to check emails, WhatsApp, messages, make calls quickly etc. Games should keep themselves away from this.",
            "Ahhh where to start.!!, yes simple and daily usage mobile, one day battery life for normal usage. Great performance with A13 Bionic chip. Apple selling this mobile without technology, there is no great things to do, iPhone 8 with latest processor, if you can afford go for iPhone XR or iPhone 11, else go for one plus 8 series.",
            "This is the best phone you can buy in this price.\nWith this #banchinaproducts moment, this is the best option.\nI know this product is assembled in china but its a American product so I am satisfied.\nIts a breakthrough of great performance and minimalist design.",
            "I have been using the iPhone se 2020 for close to a week now and I am super happy with the experience. As you might have seen in multiple reviews of the device, the battery life is a setback. But the battery easily lasts for a day with a good amount of gaming and video streaming and that works for a user like me.",
            "It\u2019s a great IPhone. Those who are using 6 and 6s should definitely upgrade. But those who are using 7 and above should not as 7 is still a fast phone and it will get atleast one more year of update. Coming to iPhone se it\u2019s a great phone. Camera is great. Features are great. Battery is issue. It won\u2019t last you whole day if your a heavy user. Expect 5 hours of screen time of your heavy user. Otherwise overall good value for money.",
            "se Apple is good phone , quick delivery, good camera, handy, easily useable but without gst reverse bill . ipurchased this phone for my company but flipkart not give me gst reverse bill",
            "Excellent phone. For budget-minded users, this SE version is about half the price of the iPhone 11 and is easily comparable in its operations, even using the latest A13 processor which is new in the 11. All said this is a great phone, very well worth the money, and a great deal from Flipkart...Kudos!!!",
            "I used windows phone, android phone (Lenovo and Moto) and now this. I am not impressed more than my previous phone Moto X4 to this. Be it charging, ease of using. I got used to Moto actions so much that I unintentionally do the same operation here and then realise that I am no longer using Moto.\n\nSince it is still a week when I started using iPhone would like to wait for a month to see to find the ease of use.",
            "I gifted it to my girlfriend she is very happy with it but it\u2019s not for show off, people might make fun of you using this product, I\u2019m thinking of buying 12 pro for her in sometime",
            "It is an awesome device, you get all the perfomance you need in this small form factor size. Display quality is good, camera is awesome (could have been better). The only disappointment is battery, you will get an average of 5 hours after full charge. If you are looking for a device with excellent perfomance in a small form factor and can compromise with the battery then this one is for you.",
            "Design is awesome and one of the primary reason to buy. But build quality have compromised as in one month the back galss got scraches but its ok and vary from user to user.\n\nCamara is best in this price but if you use it it eats battery like hell which I dont liked.\n\nGamming is also good but again eats battery not good If you play games more often you need to charge it.\n\nIn my opinion I am not happy as my usage remains same for old iPhone SE and new iPhone SE 2020. If you need a phone and you want it to be iphone go for Old SE. Both works same on moderate usage.\n\nUse Clash of clains, Whatsapp, Instagram, Youtube and 2-3 Phone Calls on Mobile Data congratulation you have low battery.\n\nI spend 38k for Camara, small size, eSim , A13 chip and future updates to use my Phone in low power mode(AppleSupport Suggested).\n\nPersonally I will not buy apple's any new budget phone. I expect this to be best but unfortunately last. Will sell it in some time. Please connect to buy.\n\nIf any one dont have this I guess you are blessd !",

Camera is good and the feel premium and is very light and using IOS for first time was not easy , almost took 2 day to understand this phone completely, now everything is very easy , Screen size is actually small but good for those who like compact phones , all last this phone justifies it\u2019s cost for me",
            "I am happy to share here the experience I acquired on Flipkart. Apple and a great creation. Awesome in terms of performance, not like the company said in terms of battery. It takes a maximum of two and a half hours to fully charge. As far as the camera is concerned we can only take the best portrait we know of its function after use, overall awesome. The best phone for this price ...",
            "Just wow. This phone\u2019s a breeze. The apple ecosystem is obviously extraordinary and with the phone\u2019s chip and ram management one wouldn\u2019t have no lag whatsoever. The camera is excellent and for my usage the battery is sufficient. Better carry a powerbank if you\u2019re a heavy user. If you want a small form factor device and doesn\u2019t want to lavishly splash money, then just go for this.",
            "Its my first iphone. Always wanted to own an iphone and boy its such a great first one. Its really refreshing to use a small screen after such a longe time and it'll surely take some time to get used to it (again). I seriously don't like to use my old oneplus 6 now but ios has some limitations or rather it would take time to get used to it. Thanks flipkart for delivering it the next day, something that i didn't expect from flipkart.",

CHHOTA PACKET BADA DHAMAKA\u2026.\nI love this iPhone model. Great camera for pics and videos\nBattery life is good so far with some setting turn of which i never use and when i use i turn those on and i use it in power saving mode all the time so a full day with light gaming of 1hr or more using camera for 1hr or more listening music in my car on youtube and Bluetooth on for couple of hours it gives me full day of battery varing from 4/5 to 6/7 hours sot per day\nPerformance is top notch plays every game and every task with ease\nVery premium phone looks great in black colour small handy phone",
            "It's a good buy. If you want to experience the apple brand. I would suggest you to buy the product. Apple phones are actually good for around 3-4 years post that because of software updates they become quite slow. So a good phone if you usually change your phone post 3 years of usage.",
            "Keep it simple.\nTo be used as a phone only :\nSocial media apps, video calling , navigation., Quick HD photography , all your day to day utility apps etc...\n\nSpecial call out on the camera which is brilliant and allows you to take amazing pictures and editing features.\n\nNot suitable for using it as a gaming , movie watching , high screen time consumption activity device - the screen and battery are just not made for it.",
            "An iPhone with duel sim capability and a decent battery life. What else do I want?? Extremely handy. Switched from android and loving the decision. a phone that\u2019s better than one plus in all aspects (including price as well). A beautiful piece of equipment.",
            "Compact yet powerful. It\u2019s small size is what made me buy it. Small phones with decent performance and good build quality are a rare sight these days. Go for it if you don\u2019t like to carry phones as big as chopping boards in your pockets.",
            "1. Camera is too good.\n2. Performance it's also good just like a beast in a small pack.\n3. I don't know why people said about its battery is not good, I think it's good for this phone size ,screen that's why it's a beast in a speed test.",
            "This is a great phone with old school features as required by me. Been using for a week n performance great, no lag n only small screen as compared to samsung s10. but that what i wanted a small phone.\n1 very important thing battery is very good pls dont read too much as a normal user doing office mails n taking calls battery lasts for 10 hours. for gaming n watching movies perspective its not a great phone but dats not what i wanted so fits d bill for me.\n\nguys planing to buy this - its a good buy at 30k, great performance, good camera n a compact phone with a decent battery.",
            "Cons:\n1. Finger print response time is very slow compared with older version iPhones..\n2. Apps are hanging and restarting ..\n3. left side loud speaker is very low compared to right side speaker.\n4. Reachable facility is not working properly as home button response is very bad\nI never felt this kind of issues in older iPhones ..\n\nPros:\n\n1. Good display\n2. Good camera\n3. Good network coverage",
            "Great phone. Tough to find such compact phones in the android world. If only Apple had given a charger and earphones, it'd have been awesome. Battery life is fine but not that great. Rest everything is 10 on 10",
            "The best cell phone for those who likes smaller screen size and same performance like XR. Camera clarity is awesome. I am a fan of iPhone, used 4S, 6 and 6S. SE looks like 6/6S but performance is far better.",
            "This phone is all that you want it for. All the high end phones from other brands may give you good experience but so does iPhone SE and some more. It is splendid in rendering anything you want it to do. Whether playing games, taking photographs, enjoy watching videos online or in an app, everything is smooth and a pleasure to do. The haptic engine enhances any game you play (as it\u2019s described in other brand phones description and reviews). No complaints, except that the battery is just decently good and cost is slightly higher end but if you could get it at a deal price, then it is completely satisfactory. The phone is as good as one plus or Samsung or any high end phone in the market. I loved the fresh experience it gave. Its damn good.",
            "I am writing this review after 9 days of use. I didn't play games but my son install pubg mobile and it works fine. I use it for various bank transactions and official use only for the reason for security purposes. And the battery works upto 36 hrs. I am happy to have a nice mobile like this though it is little bit pricey.",
            "One of best phone, I upgrade from Iphone 7.. as said battery mAh is 1821 only but it is far better than 3000 mAh of other android phone.. and so fast, I love it..",
            "Like many others this was my first iPhone. Being an android user I was very apprehensive at first but decided to give it a shot. At first the only thing that looked out of league was the screen size, but trust me once you get used to it this won\u2019t even matter.\n\nAs for the performance it has everything for your day to day need. A stunning camera, premium glass back look and smooth performance will be more than enough for you to win over. Read a lot of negative reviews about battery but if you are an average user the battery won\u2019t disappoint.\n\nFive stars",
            "Fabulous performance with improved battery than previous model which i bought in 2017.....worth buying ....single camera is enough with improved quality ....and better than its rival one plus .......if you want a smaller size phone with great performance than go for it",
            "Have been using iPhone right from years now , upgraded this iPhone Se from iPhone 6s plus , It is simply amazing how it feels and is a very smooth and small phone which i loved .\nIt has small design which makes it very easy to use and it simply doesn't feel big , people who don't like big phones can simply go with it .",
            "This phone is good but not as good as iPhone 5s when we compare with that phone of its time, yet this is much upgraded with that now as up now but 5s is master piece",
            "The best phone ever..\nI like small size mobiles & this satisfied me\nBest Phone 5*****\nCharging also full day with normal usage\nI don\u2019t play games\nI use wallets & calls mostly\nIt was the best iPhone\n128gb ..",

            "Very Good product I love my iPhone, it is very good I good deal and exchange my old phone.",
            "In today's bigger screen and higher refresh rate age of Android phones, it is going to be treated as small screen, lower battery etc. But as a new entrant in apple eco system, it seems to be a good buy. Bit tough to use after 8 years of feature phone use and another 8 years of Android use. But love this challange. \ud83e\udd70\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc4c",
            "This phone is real value for money and I just got it for 29990\n\nIf you give your old phone you can get it at much lesser price\n\nJust ensure you put a tough screen guard for top and a tough mobile cover which is slightly raised from the sides",
            "Everything is awesome in terms of the product and delivery time . The product was delivered within less then 24 hrs .\nthe iPhone SE 2020 which I ordered came as per the expected delivery date and time .

In my point of view iphone is always iphone they wont compromise the product quality for the cost cutting . Within the price range you cant find any android phone which is having these much features. Im an android user for past 9 yrs initially faced some issue but going on i used to it . If you dont have enough money to get larger iphones like 13 13 pro 13 mini you can simply buy this one.",
            "I got 64 GB, product red.. it is very handy and ios 15 is stunning . considering battery if you are a heavy user this phone is not for you, But for my usage its good..\nCamera is good, but it will detect only face in portrait not objects, obviously due to Apple\u2019s new environmental policy they will not include charger in box. Its compact at the same time its slippery too. A13 bionic can handle games seamlessly but battery will drain fast. There is no heating issues so far. I installed all the productive & entertainment apps that i used in android but still my storage is 18GB occupied. For storing photos i was using google photos and for files google drive.\nIf you are a casual user and in need of good camera, high performance and compact phone you can go with this cute little SE\nI am in chennai & flipkart delivered in 1 day",
            "Firstly great thanks to flipkart for the offer price and also for the quick delivery and genuine product\nI have been an iphone user since almost 8 yrs now and wanted a secondary phone and I bought this, absolutely handy device and awesome in every way, battery life is also really great, no complaints \ud83d\ude0a",
            "Received my device in 48 hours, that too at a remote place. This is my 3rd iPhone ( After iPhone 4S & iPhone 6). Well\u2026. The device is slim & display is top notch. Interface is super quick. Camera is Ok. But I ain\u2019t disappointed since, I use iPhone for official purposes. For photography my Samsung A50 is doing a terrific job. Battery life, I feel, is better than previous iPhone 6. What really disappointed me is\n\n1) No charger came with the box. Luckily I had my previous charger\n2) No earphone jack. Although my Sennheiser earphones are in perfect working condition, I still had to order a pair of EarPods",
            "This is a very special device with much comfortable in hand. Cameras are very good compared to previous gen iPhones, just a major drawback is the battery. Usually it gives 4 hours of SOT which is satisfactory. Those who are planning to buy an iPhone which has good in hand feeling and nice cameras with super performance, then go for it",
            "Absolute compact phone.those who need one handy phone,pls go for it\nPerformance at the best level\nCamera also good ,except night photographs\nVideo quality at the super level\nBattery up to mark as its 1821 mAh(screen on time:5 hours if not play BGMI or COD)\nScreen LCD panel still bright and colour\nSound quality also the best\nNetworks good(as i use airtel ,no issue at all)\n100% recommended",

I would suggest you to go for the iphone 12 mini as it not much of a price difference : )\nThank you",

            "Great value for money phone. Coming from the big phones this was sleek, smooth elegant great comfortable to hold. This is not for the heavy usage people because of the small form battery. But a very decent battery for normal use like calls and whatsapp. White color looks more premium and no ear piece and phone heating issue on long calls. Nice phone and Flipkart service is also goods.",
            "I'm writing this review after the usage of 6 months. Its a classic product. Performance is above our expectations and camera quality is awesome. The most impressive feature about apple products is its stabiliy for longer periods. Even after receiving numerous updates for the last few months, its stability ha not gone down unlike android phones. The only disappointed fact with regard to SE2 is battery. Really disappointing. Else its a great phone with powerful chipset.\n\nI recommend this phone for those are not that affectionate towards YouTube, Web sires or games. With its 1820 mAh Capacity battery it hardly last for a day.\n\nOverall 3.5/5\nIf battery issue can be solved its gonna rock.",
            "Its a great phone in value for money. Works fine with A13 chip.. all good.got it from 33k .\n\nPoint to be considered. It dont have face recognition , finger print works fine .\nAlso with no headset no or usb charging cable coming. One lighting cable and the phone will deliver only. You have to change this from laptop or buy usb type charger cable and adapter later",
            "This is my first iphone and its great !!! This phone is fast and smooth, Camera is par with iphone 11 except the wideangle ofc. I am writing this review after 4 months and till now no major problem or anything just a con is the battery. If you a couch potato and wants a phone for netflix and video streaming then this wont be the perfect choice for you. The battery life is pretty good is your usage is less. Pubg and other games run like butter no lags no shutters just you wont be able to play for long hours as this phone has less battery",
            "1. Camera is good in good light condition in indoor camera is decent\n2. Performence is superb\n3 . Look premium",
            "While we go deep in review we need to understand a fact that this phone is not for heavy users and for photo enthusiasts.\nnight pictures are not up to mark, but that even apple isn\u2019t claiming for this particular phone.\n\nThis phone is very light in weight and delivers very well for what it meant to be.\n\nThings which I like about this phone:\n1. Light in weight\n2. Having A13 chip set, which delivers all task smoothly\n3. Cost effective phone to enter in apple eco system\n\n\nIn the end while purchasing this phone consider your daily phone usage in mind, if you are a heavy gamer or in video blogging then you must buy a fast charger and power bank.",
            "Great performance,great camera and fabulous product at reasonable price. Thanks apple and Flipkart for fast and secure delivery",
            "If someone ask me for to make choices between iPhone and android phones\n\nI always choose iPhone only\n\nAbout IPHONE SE superb and fantastic who are looking for handy phone with 4.7 inch screen, with all the latest features and choices.",
            "Light in hand it\u2019s an Apple product which easily outperforms any and all of its contenders. Packed with all the features it introduces the concept of esim in dual sim with one physical and other esim activated through network provider. It takes just 2 hrs for activation and SMS after 24 hrs. Bandwidth performs slightly better compared to physical one. Image quality is always best and gaming rendering is perfect without lag. Storage and app availability is also good. Not to mention the Audio quality it\u2019s simply the best in class. Best phone for transition from android.",
            "One of the best mobile with fantastic camera really loved it but coming to display size and battery backup just little bit disappointed rather then this iPhone se simply good \ud83d\ude0d",
            "Best iPhone at this price range. If u want handy iphone with best processor. Then it will suits for u.",
            "Wow worth for money for this price\nI still use this last 4 months superb performance\nGreat quality I dropped many time no damage in body and display thank u iphone and Flipkart",
            "If you are not into playing games on mobile, then this is the best phone. Quality is amazing. Each and every component is premium whether we talk about camera or even microphone. Most people don\u2019t realise the amount of tiny compromises made by Android phones to reduce cost. iPhone is expensive because it doesn\u2019t compromise on quality even for things that people barely notice. And the best part is that you will continue to receive free OS updates for at least 5 years.",
            "A powerful beast . iOS is smooth as always. Camera is wow , you can use this as portable camera for your road trips , size is just perfect . Everything is fine from my side , I will update regarding the battery backup after using few months .",
            "Absolutely fantastic product for the price. It's handy, good for people who prefer small phones. I love the performance.",
            "I'm no one to review this product, since as everyone knows it's APPLE and they maintain the quality as usual. The feedback I can give on this is regarding Flipkart, the package was good, delivery was fast & safely handed over the product.\n\nAdding some personal feel-good points;-\n\n1. Pure piece of tech art\n2. Red color is something really needs to look, touch n feel\n3. freaking handy [better to use a case to maintain that look for long]\n4. Not recommended for hardcore phone addicts when considering battery backup.\n5. Camera is natural.",
            "Don't wait too much to think , just go for it if you have this in mind. Yes it's a compact device and if you have been using phones with big display then it may feel tiny at first but you would get used to it.\nA13 bionic is a charm and this brings out camera performance out if the older hardware that this phone has. It's a hybrid beast of a device and can suffice any day to day task. Yes if your intention is heavy gaming then the battery won't last long as it's tiny body holds a small capacity so heavy gaming and extensive camera and videography would dry out the juice pretty quick, other than that if you take photos and videos time to time and not continuosly then it's perfect. The display quality is pretty good too. I purchased this Device 1 year after its launch and am not having any issues yet , so no regrets.",
            "Display, Performance, Handling is awesome.\nOnle two issues you have to mahe with:-\nContinuous use of phone will drain out battery very fast.\nCamera performance in good light condition is awesome, it's unbeatable. But in low light you will not get such performance. Otherwise it's an awesome product.\nBattery standby performance is awesome. As I go to office, after charging it 100% at 08:30 am, battery after 12 hours stays at around 50% in normal usage. However coming back home and then using for around 2 hours continuously on Video calls through Whatsapp, Email checking, web browsing etc it goes down to 10%. Then I charge it back to 80% and and leave it overnight it goes to 70% in morning.\n\nOverall only downside is BATTERY. Otherwise it's a pretty good handy phone. You should not expect continuous usage of more than 4-5 hrs when you are playing a game or playing video over YouTube. You can take it for day to day normal works- For me it's Calls, Whatsapp, Email, Photo capturing, Insta etc..\n\nI am still exploring other features of the iPhone, will update once done.",
            "I switched to iphone from android its an very good option. Ios is just awsome. And size of SE is very compact. For i feel like screen size is little bit small but after use of 2 days its very nice experience. iPhone just nailed it.",
            "All are well Good and much better than 11 .but battery backup is too bad. I give this rating after 3 months..",
            "Its small,sleek and handy. Powered by A13 bionic. So this one is a performance beast in a small body. When it comes to design,its same as iphone 8 but the internals are quite different. It has only one wide angle camera but that one is great. The display is an ips retina display which is not bad. The main drawback is the battery. This phone has 1821mah battery which is too small. If you are a hardcore user then it wont last for a day. And this phone is Ip67 rated and supports wireless and fast charging too. At this price point these features are awesome. Literally to get this phone in this price we need to sacrifice something like batteries and design. Even its an old design its always looks premium bcoz its \uf8ff",
            "Upgraded from 5s, feeling great while using it the touch is smooth and iOS blends perfectly with the hardware",
            "Great Product In terms of Camera and Processing the image\nThe A13 Bionic chip does its job Great The battery could be better. Overall great product",
            "nice product...just be cautious to use the phone judiciously ....in general with light gaming i am getting around a full day with 30% battery left...mostly use it as my primary non-gaming purpose. love the size..fits well unlike a 6 inch phone",
            "I prefer small phones so this was the perfect choice and the rate at which it was available made it possible for me to buy my first iPhone. Thanks to Flipkart for providing such amazing offer.",
            "The phone is very fast and smooth never gave me any issue the battery is on low side but camera to gaming all are on top of the line for casual people you don't need a dslr this phone can take some great photos and videos",
            "i love it just amazing in every field. those who love small and powerful phone they can go for it. superb performance",
            "its really good especially the red colour. among 2 variants of 64 gb and 128gb , i will recommend for 128 gb unless it is not for elderly people. It is much cheaper as compared to IPhone 11 and 12 though u get almost everything .",
            "I loved it... This phone gives a sense of luxury, security, and good worth of money. Highly recommend this one. Surprisingly the size of it is perfect, never thought it but it is just perfect.\nOnly one con i.e battery performance is just average will give you 4-5 hrs of SOT but it has a great stand-by time.\nGo for it!",
            "Phone reached me safely. Packaging was nice. Happy with the seller\u2019s integrity. A Mighty handy phone for everyday use. Battery is on the lower side and hardly needs a charge every evening depending on the usage. Otherwise A class.",
            "Most affordable classy phone in the market , I bought this product red for my mother and this color enhanced the glamour of the person holding it.",
            "I am writing this review after few days of use so it is just awesome. Camera quality is not satisfactory as the video made by this phone are yellowish in colour as compared to other phone videos.\nSpeed is just awesome as A13 Bionic chip is there.\nBattery is 1800 mAh so it doesn\u2019t last long as iPhones are not made for long lasting batteries but they are light in weight and high performance with no problem of hang.\nI used my Iphone 6s for 4 years 8 months so I expect this one to last ling at least for 4 years.\nI have downloaded itunes in my PC and previous phone 6s was synced so when I synced new iPhone on same PC I got all the settings and data as it was in previous phone. That means I got my previous phone with new performance hardware.",
            "Excellent investment if you want to experience ios at such a low price with flagship features. If you love classic phones, it is just made for you. You can do everything in this phone. Battery is not so good, but if you are not a heavy user, it will work for you. Camera is excellent as compared to other android phones but not as good as other iphones. It will feel glossy in your hands. And rest all the features are just brilliant.",
            "I\u2019ve been using this iPhone since last 6 months previous to this I was using iPhone 7.\nIt is the awesome phone without a doubt.\nBut if you want a bigger screen you\u2019re not going to enjoy this, if you want a compact and comfortable screen this is the phone to purchase.",
            "Overall it\u2019s a good mobile for daily usage, those who like compact phone and don\u2019t not play much games and don\u2019t watch much movies can buy this phone as battery and small screen are concern.",
            "If you like to use a premium phone, solid buildup design and processor then don\u2019t give it a second thought. It\u2019s so gooood I love it!!! There is no comparison between android and apple",

            "such a really nice phone but is this only undar 30k best its value is only 30k is ok more than not good",
            "Writing the review after 6 months usage-\n-no lags, battery is good for one day usage.\n-not for gaming\n-u get good \ud83d\udcf7\nNext powerful after 7, 8 with latest processor.\nIt\u2019s just better if u want to upgrade from 6s or later, like I did.",

            "Iphone doesn't need any major review as it's already a pioneer in its own field. However qeith Iphone SE, this works well for those who have tight budget and can't afford high end iphones. Works well for single hand usage, quite good screen to body ratio and latest processor (iphone 11). Will not disappoint anyone who would like to go for iphone.",
            "A good phone I say but not the best As battery life is not at all to the apple standard. Otherwise value for money if available during offer period.",
            "Awesome phone, small and handy, I got it for just 21,500 with exchange ....so it was a great deal.....performance is top notch ,display is at its best, ,sound quality is good,camera is at its best with great video recording at 4k 60 fps and portrait mode is also good\nOnly problem that I found was that iPhone starts vibrating when speakers are in use .\nOverall its good ..go for it guys",
            "It\u2019s been almost a week since I\u2019ve started using the phone and it\u2019s pretty impressive for the specs it gets. I upgraded from the 6 which happens to have the same battery as this one but the phone has been lasting a complete day easily and definitely way more than my 6 did when I bought it. Coming to the highly complained 1821 mAh battery, I charge it in the morning around 9 and it has 20% left before I go to bed. Then again, it\u2019ll vary from user to user.\n\nThe iOS experience along with the A13 bionic chip is simply insane. The battery optimisation is unbelievable and although it has a 3 GB ram, it works like a monster.\n\nThe display is an LCD but the colour contrast is superb and the blacks are surprisingly good. Honestly, unless you\u2019re a technical nerd, the 60Hz LCD Display will not be disappointing.\n\nThe bezels might be concerning for some people who have been using recent android phones which have the full screen displays but if you\u2019re upgrading from an older android or an iPhone 8 or older it\u2019s nothing to worry about.\n\nThe camera is excellent and is easily comparable to those of flagship androids or even the iPhone 12 series. You\u2019ll be capable of shooting videos at 4K 60fps with brilliant Stabilisation. Yes, you do compromise on the night mode and ultra wide camera but then again, people upgrading from older phones or those who don\u2019t use the camera constantly will not miss it.\n\nThe biggest buying point should be the fact that it\u2019s going to last you at least 5-6 years for this price compared to the maximum of 3/4 years on androids for the same price. It\u2019s extremely durable with the IP67 water and dust resistance and servicing (both Apple and 3rd party repairs) is also cheap due to a majority of its external hardware coming from the older iPhones.\n\nFor the record, the SE 1st gen (launched in March 2016) is still getting iOS and security updates. That\u2019s 6 years of software support. My 6 has been running from 2015 till now. It stopped getting iOS updates 2 years back but I\u2019m still getting security updates and it\u2019s only gone through a battery replacement and 2 screen replacements till now.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for the cleanest, safest and the most reliable and smooth software experience along with pretty good hardware, this one should be a no brainer.",
            "I bought it for 26k during sale, so it was a good deal. These are the pros and cons which I listed after using it for 2 months.\nPros\n1. Good Camera.\n2. Incredible performance.\n3. Water and dust resistant.\n4. Tells your usage time.\n5. Handy to use.\n\nCons\n1. Pathetic battery(android phones with price < 6k have outstanding battery)\n2. Takes too long for charging(1.5 hr from 0 to 100)\n3. No physical slot for second sim card, it has esim feature. (Not all service providers give this facility)\n4. No MicroSD card slot.",
            "I always wanted to buy an iPhone, to myself experience the Hype surrounding it. Finally, I bought it during the Big Billion Days Sale on Flipkart & below are my observations after using it for almost 3 months.\n\n1) Sound: If you not using any earphones, headphones or any other Bluetooth Devices for getting Sound output, then Sound output of the Mobile in use plays a very important part. While on a call in a noisy Environment & having patchy Network, it becomes very difficult to have a proper conversation without having to ask person at other end to repeat, every now & then. This is where iPhone SE scores full marks. The Sound output is really good while talking normally. If you put the phone on Loudspeaker, then you can easily do multi-tasking on the phone or otherwise. Even for listening to few songs, iPhone SE is quite good.\n\n2) Camera: What impressed me most about the Cameras is that inspite of it being Single Camera (on both back & front), it manages to click very good pics under proper lights. Apple does not boast about high Mega Pixel Cameras, but photos clicked with my iPhone seems natural. It does not make us artificially beautiful like its Chinese Counterparts. Also, the Software optimization & bokeh effects available on iPhone SE can easily compete with any other smartphone in sub 25K range & easily beat them hands down. I will not talk about Night Vision, because it is simply not made for it. The nearest competition it faces is from OnePlus Nord & Google Pixel 4A, both of which have Night Vision.\n\nIn short, it is having the best sound output & camera (Photo effects) if you get 128 GB below 30K.\n\n3) Battery: It is the biggest let-down of this phone. Though it supports wireless charging, you will have to buy it separately for minimum 1K. Even under moderate use, you will have to charge the phone more than once a day. I have switched on the Low Data Mode & started using Low Power Mode regularly, to get more battery backup from my Phone. If you are using Wi-Fi or Mobile Data & Siri, then the battery levels drop drastically fast & thats why I use them very less..\n\n4) Updates: You cannot do software updates through your Mobile Data. If you do not have a Wi-Fi (like me), you will need to switch on the Mobile Hotspot of other Device & connect your iPhone to that Mobile Hotspot & only then, the download & install button becomes available for use. Using Mobile Data, it will only show the availability & size of Software Update. Even after connecting to a Wi-Fi, the screen will be stuck on estimated time remaining for many hours, without any progress.\n\nTill date, my Phone has received 3 updates (the latest being IOS Version 14.3, received yesterday). But everytime, I have to connect iPhone to my Laptop using its Cable & upgrade using iTunes downloaded on my Laptop using Recovery Mode on iPhone. One more thing that I have observed is that while the update size shows approx. 533 MB on my Phone, when I connect it to iTunes on my Laptop, it downloads almost 5-6 GB of data everytime. It takes 30-45 minutes of time to install the IOS update.\n\n5) Miscellaneous: It does not allow you to disable the dialler sound without putting the phone on Silent using the Slider button. It is Water-Proof to some extent, but I have not tried it till now. It supports fast-charging of 18 Watts, so use a good branded Power Adapter for charging (less waiting). Its back is glossy, hence is a fingerprint magnet & its screen will easily get scratches. So use a back cover & go for a toughened glass for the Screen. It supports Dual Sim (one Physical Sim & one E-Sim). Jio & Airtel users can get E-Sim for iPhone SE in India. You will get Apple Music free for 90 days & Apple TV free for 1 year, but I have not activated either of them till now.\n\nThanks & Regards,",

Great phone, just be aware that you'll have to charge it multiple times a day, so don't forget to carry a power bank!",
            "Best in the market\nSeriously no android phone can compete with this 4.7 inch beast performing device. A13 Bionic is far more superior than Snapdragon 865. I am an hardcore android guy & I am giving my genuine review after 4 days of extensive IOS usage",
            "The iPhone SE 2020 is a real value for money mobile device. It has got the latest processor (A13 Bionic Chip) which is said to be the fastest processor that is present in the current market. The camera is a real catch having support for high definition video and photos that can be shot in portrait mode which adds a certain depth to the photos. The 4.7 inch screen is a real compact and comfy size for those who do not prefer large phone sizes. The battery life is great as well. All in all the iPhone SE 2020 is a great device at a reasonable price and has a set of great specs like those of the higher end Apple devices.",
            "Best camera quality a. A good option to buy at a reasonable price too. Would totally recommend buying this mobile",
            "Best phone at this range battery backup is also good display is awesome it is best phone for gaming and all other use Ram management is too good. This is best phone it is value for money.Just go for it",
            "If you are looking for a handy phone with best display and camera, go for it. Battery backup isnt that great, would know if you had been an iphone user before, but overall its so worth it !",
            "Apple always best if you know how to jailbreak. Much faster processor battery too good and dual sim management better than non iOS device.",
            "It's lighting fast and picture quality is marvelous. Excellent battery except that if you are more on online streaming and gaming then you need to carry a 20k mah power bank. Shipment was delivered before the mentioned date and packaging was firm and sturdy when received. Overall I rate 5/5. End of the day an iPhone is an iPhone. Thanks flipkart for the best online offer.",
            "Best phone at this price...camera is also great with right lighting... Very easy to use in one hand. Very light in weight but still gives a good feeling in hands.....battery backup is also not that bad as everybody says...the A13 chip uses the power very smartly.overall a good quality product at reasonable price.",
            "I am writing this review after more than a months usage, so here are my observations and findings.\n\n1. Excellent OS, super fast A13 chip no lag at all. Nice animations, highly customization now with ios 14.1 update. It will amaze you.\n2. Superb display especially when you zoom a picture it retains its pixels, awesome.\n3. Amazing 4K video at 60 FPS, absolutely amazing clarity.\n4. Very good speakers.\n5. Very light weight infact you wont feel its in your pocket.\n6. Camera is great with good clarity in day light.\n7. 64GB default space which is really good.\n8. Free apple tv subscriptions for 1 year.\n\nOnly downside is less capacity battery one day max use.\nIf you are heavy user this phone is not for you. If you use for just calls and texting then battery will last a full day.\n\nIf you can overlook battery then this phone will amaze you in many ways. Definitely worth every single rupee you put.",
            "I was using iPhone 6s earlier. So for me this phone is not an upgrade as such because the features are almost the same in both phones. Only in iPhone SE there is dual sim and front camera is of 7MP. Still I\u2019m loving this phone. It has got a decent battery life (as compared to iPhone 6S) and the look and feel of this phone, especially in red colour is awesome. The camera and phone performance obviously are good as with all iPhones. For first time iPhone users, this should be the best phone to upgrade to. This phone won\u2019t disappoint. Thank you Flipkart for delivering this phone within 24 hours.",
            "This is my 1st iOS product and I am loving it\nGrate value of money\nGreat performance\nGreat camera\nOverall it\u2019s best\nLess to expend\nLots of love\n\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",
            "For a Advanced Old School freek.\n1. Battery backup is quite good as most of working type guy like me frequently use call, whatsapp, email on a daily basis in such case it will last for 11 hrs .\n2. Handy for me it's smart & fast but not a phablet like device for me Its 4'7 inch display is called phone .\n3. No need for Fast charger as it get full charged with in 2.30 hrs just put it after wake up & take it once you are ready .\n\nRest things are mentioned by others for me I just want a smart speedy basic mobile phone ....loved it",
            "I bought this phone with excitement and its really a fast phone. I like its fast processing and camera clarity but battery is little week in this phone.",
            "Nice single camera phone with average battery backup but I feel the price should be less than 40k as per the features of the phone. Overall I don't recommend to buy it just because of the price. But if you want an iPhone its the cheapest option(launched in 2020)",
            "It\u2019s a pretty robust phone. Powerful then my Mac or my windows laptop. My screen time is around 7 hours as I do most of my stuffs from my phone. Be it a presentation or a photography- this device is very powerful . Thanks to Apple",
            "Compact size for those who want to use mobile phone with one hand, performance very fast and very smooth thanks to Bionic chip 13.",
            "The phone just works ok. The battery backup is worst. Its only a few months and the battery health is reduced to 97%. The battery lasts less than a day. The display is just ok. I have a 3 year old iPhone xr which works great still.\nRecommended for only those people who need small size budget iPhone.",
            "Pretty good device for the offer price, not that great battery life, everything else is top notch.",
            "Super phone and super camera and batter performance is bad and display super value for money also good and phone is very fast",
            "Average camera quality if you love best camera phone then this is not the product for you\nAverage battery life also can't comment much since it's only few weeks before I purchased but definitely it's not a good battery\nApart from camera and battery rest of the phone can match with expensive phone features. It has A13 chip which means performance will be better than iPhone 8 and 10",
            "This thing is crazy fast and captures crispy photos but doesn\u2019t have nightmode ( now a days 10k phone\u2019s have nightmode) . Display is good but not bright as 2021 standards , battery optimisation is great I get around 7-8 hours of screen on time , fast charging works great , smaller display is bit of problem here otherwise this is a beast",
            "Ossam phone,my first I phone so very much excited to use this.everything is great except battery but u may optimise battery usage by making suitable settings and after that all great. Finally want too say only one thing No I phone user will never use any other brand phone.",
            "Pros :\nExcellent performance\nZero lags\nGood software support\nExcellent camera\nBetter / stable apps compared to android\n\nCons :\nMediocre battery life\n\nNote: display is good enough for a 4.7'' phone. No pixelation\nIt can run all the demanding games and can take really good pics . The only thing you need to understand is that for a heavy user the battery will last from 10 am - 4 pm",
            "Apple products are the best designed and architected devices with leading industry standards.\nthis one is best for casual use. one of the fastest devices in this price range.\n\nOverpriced as per tech experts.\nThe battery is best in ios devices.\nThe camera is average but you can click stunning pics in Daylight.\nYou can Opt for these Devices if your use is decent.\nIf you love Android Os and Chinese phones such as Redmi, one plus then don't buy this one. Sometimes it is difficult to adjust industry standards when you stuck to basic products.\n\nIf you need performance, speed, and durability buy it without hesitation.",
            "It is fully hawa Naz phone . Back bottom on top so it is not comfort to easy back chapare to other phone.\n\nCharger need to be commonized\nBattery need to be increase",
            "Switched from iPhone 6 to iPhone SE 2020.\nNever wanted the big sizes, this is the best option as a beast in a small shell.\nBattery backup is fine which is around 6 hours in a single charge with dual sim.\nOther all functionalities are excellent as expected.\nIn a short note, giving 9 on 10 for this product.",
            "I had no other option so opted for this as I have been using iPhone for the past 12 yrs now. People who love to be on most of the time(gaming n browsing), this piece is not good for you as battery still sucks.\nMusic lovers you can have a superb feel on speaker as apple has got it better than previous ones.",
            "Apple is very nice but battery life not bad and Flipkart very wonderful support and delivery nice payment very fast thank you so much Flipkart very useful every time good keep going my support anytime thank you sir",
            "Everything is excellent about this phone. Compact size, nice bright display, superb performance. Except for the battery. It hardly covers entire day. But over the time battery performance improved a little as it understands the usage.",
            "This is perfect phone for the people who like small mobiles. Camera and Sound Quality is good. Battery could be better. No dedicated headphone jack like old SE , Charging cable cant be used directly to charge on laptop USB as it doesn't have USB supported cable. For headphone/earphone and charging cable you need to buy connector from the market as it wont support your old charger and earphones .Apple needs to increase the battery power of this mobile",
            "Performance and camera is great. Screen is about mediocre. Battery is really bad and hardly gets to the end of the day if charged in the morning. This is a good buy if you\u2019re low on budget and you get a great deal. Looks very neat and attractive though. Go for the black color if you\u2019re in doubt, though it\u2019s more grey than black but looks very classy. About a month now and had no issues apart from small battery.",
            "I was worried about battery life because of negative comments. But it\u2019s really has good battery back up for which you don\u2019t need to worry about. If you love compact size phone then just go for it. It\u2019s really amazing masterpiece from apple. I am really loving it. Thanks Flipkart.",
            "This is a superb affordable product from Apple.\n\nPerformance : This phone\u2019s performance is nothing lesser than Flagships, it\u2019s top notch. Butter smooth experience.\n\nDesign : Feels and looks premium.\n\nSoftware : Superb and easily adaptable. Mostly importantly no junk and unwanted apps. After being a Android user for years, this is the first time I felt I have full control over my phone and my apps. Privacy = Apple and Apple = Privacy.\n\nBattery: If not for it\u2019s poor battery backup, I would have given 5 stars. Despite being a moderate user, I end up charging it twice a day.",
            "Buying a basic camera phone this price is not justified unless it is apple product. Camera quality is not good as expected from apple. Far better camera is available at half of price in other brands",
            "It is one iPhone that\u2019s value for money. Has the same processing capability of iPhone 11. Only disadvantage is a step down on camera. Works amazing like any other iPhone.",
            "GOOD BUY FOR FIRST TIME APPLE USER ALL WORKS GOOD BUT BATTERY IS NOT SO GOOD FOR HEAVY USERS IT WILL GET FOR 7HRS FOR SURE FOR FULL CHARGE AND EASY TO CHARGE FROM 0 TO 100 IN 2AND HALF HOURS GOOD CAMERA QUALITY NO LAG IN MOBILE SMOOTH OS",
            "Overall best phone for apple fans and who use their phones for light to moderate work.The A13 chip makes the processor faster and the camera of this phone is just splendid ! I would surely recommend this phone to the people looking for an iphone in a low budget :)",
            "I have purchased this phone just for the sake of Brand to gift it to my wife.! My Mi Note 9 pro max is way better to enjoy than this. Overall a good phone.",
            "This phone is awesome nd value for money all Functions are smooth superb .. camera is not on my expectations ..I gifted this phone my frnd ... nd she likes this. Nd we are happy from this iPhone SE 2020. \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a",
            "I recently bought iPhone se from flipkart at very good discount price. Great entry level phone from Apple. The camera quality is awesome and speed of iPhone is fast as well. Got a quick delivery from flipkart on the very second after purchasing it. So far I am very happy using this phone. Would recommend this phone to others as well who are looking to buy their first ever Apple iPhone. Great buy.",
            "Pros:\n1. Good camera\n2. Fast processor\n3. Secure\n4. Fast charging\n\nCons:\n1. NO CHARGING ADAPTER & EARBUDS (Although they are writing that it is included but it is not)\n2. Battery",
            "iPhone SE 2nd Gen. massive to use A13 processor for multiple application and camera clarity extremely amazing with awesome feature its so cool to handle phone and compact... battery level rating its 4star.\nRequesting to iPhone: phone is so massive try to improve battery part backup for usage.",
            "It's an outdated very very tiny phone, with a very poor battery life for a tiny phone. Only thing that's good is maybe the camera which again is useless in low light.\nEven the Netflix movies don't appear in full screen, imagine having a top and bottom bar while viewing movies on netflix on such a tiny phone. The front facing ear speaker too fades away and becomes in audible in just 2 months despite cleaning it with rubbing alcohol. The performance and the chip is useless if the phone is so tiny. Plus the back glass is extremely brittle and ready to shatter on the slightest of impacts. For those who watch movies on their phones ignore this phone. Only good thing is legendary music quality which apple is famous for.",
            "Everything is so awesome about this one, only thing is display which is quiet small. Battery life is good for me . Having 6-7 Hours of screen on time on normal usage.",
            "Woww. It's an amazing experience with such a small high performance phone. Really loved the working of this phone. The sound quality is tremendous than any other phone. Better than Dolby atmos in android as far as i felt. Better to go for it. One major difference which I have observed with respect to android is that the phone glass is so rigid that it did not have a single scratch even after it got slipped from a 2 ft height. Really awesome quality. Dont think much about battery as they made it light weight so battery capacity reduced. Overall superb performance.",
            "I am very happy with this new version, which is actually a super-improved iPhone 6. The design is a bit different, and my old 6 case covered the camera lens, but with the new case added and everything running, she's about 3 times faster than my 6, has a much better camera, and is waterproof (even better with the case). The battery also lasts longer. Obviously the processor is a lot faster, but a lot cooler as well. I was really surprised at how fast this new SE 2020 is, and you can't beat the price. Transfer was easy, and basically is a super-upgraded version of my 6, Anyone who is still using 6 or 7 should get this phone, but if you have something larger and more complicated, this would be a bit of a downgrade with the trade-off being much faster than what you have, but smaller size, with different functions (you would have to re-learn a bit). I would suggest it to almost anyone looking to upgrade at a very reasonable price.",
            "Fantastic phone using it as my secondary iphone\nIt\u2019s smooth and fast thank you Flipkart \u2764\ufe0f",
            "I am giving my opinion after using 2 days...flip kart delivered it extremely fast...it\u2019s a good budget phone...processor is very fast at least as off now...camera is very good...battery is not that up to mark like other iPhones...I think those who are using iPhone 7 or 8 won\u2019t find much difference but yes this is a value for money product...it\u2019s a sure buy in my opinion",
            "I got overheating issues with this phone that I received yesterday, can be a software bug\nBattery drains extremely\nPerformance is better than 11pro\nCamera is better than XR\nVery handy and comfortable to hold as I like bezel displays",
            "1. Amazing performance: the speed in opening and closing apps is amazing. iOS always had anyways a much sophisticated feel. The speed has increased it manifold\n2. Camera is good but not as much as you\u2019d find in android phones of this budget. That can be foregone considering other advantages. Though I would say that there are some neat features like good quality HDR, slow-mo, Live Photo, ability to move from photo to video. The best feature here is the shutter speed which you will not get in any android phone of this budget, not at least in lower RAM versions. Losing the moment because of slow shutter speed is most annoying. Here you\u2019ll never miss a moment.\n3. Size: real estate is less but after few weeks of use I find it an advantage\n4. No Face ID: again an advantage because the android phone I have of this same budget has Face ID but it was irritating and slow to recognise even without using mask. Now it makes even less sense with having to wear mask.\n5. Apple ecosystem: for someone like me who has other apple products like iPad and MacBook but stopped buying iPhones because of their high price, this is perfect.\n6. iOS: the ios13 is amazing and by virtue of having apples latest chip this phone will have greater longevity in terms of iOS updates in future\n7. Bye bye google: amazing opportunity to say bye bye to google and it\u2019s privacy-invasive apps. Even apple maps have improved considerably and one can easily use it in place of google maps. CarPlay is also a much suave and sophisticated option to android auto.",
            "Best quality phone.One of its kind,this size phone with A13 chip is unbeatable.For me its size its USP.It comfortably settles inside the pocket & can easily be handled in one hand with tea in other hand.\nCamera is excellent even night time clicks are very good.",
            "Bought this for my mom and she absolutely loves it. It\u2019s red coloured variant looks really beautiful and elegant. The size is absolutely perfect for her hands, though people with bigger hands would feel little uncomfortable using it. The camera is good except for the portrait mode, that\u2019s not as good as the ones with physical secondary lens, needless to explain that. The performance is pretty amazing for general use though I doubt it\u2019s suitability for gaming (would play games like PUBG, COD very well, but would you get immersive experience playing it on a small phone like this?).Battery life is pretty decent too. Overall, it\u2019s a amazing phone, if you are not much into games and performance demanding borderline stuff.",
            "This phone have serious battery problems , it didn\u2019t last the day. If you are playing game or doing video call then battery would drain very fast. Signal strength and wifi reception is also not very good due to old hardware.Even cheaper android phones have better wifi reception now. Camera is good but no night mode makes it weaker. And yes performance is too good but that cost your battery. To a new person who switches from android to ios, I would like to tell you that this phone gives tou privacy and security but not comfort and easiness in functionality and apps you used. Many apps which works well in android don\u2019t work properly on ios like truecaller, blocking spam Messages,download music. Choice is your guys. For me its not worth the money. Probably high end iphones would be good but not this one.",
            "Awesome product... Super fast processor.... camera is good... cool design... Red is really nice...",
            "Small compact package that is light and easy to use. Comfort of the Small screen is refreshing, premium feel and excellent build quality, doesn't have the gesture controls but very powerful and good camera (Day light photos are spectacular). Battery life is a day on moderate usage with occasional heating during Camera usage.\n\nFor those who need a phone that can last for 4 years but are not looking at it as a primary entertainment device.",

            "Expected a better battery management. Looking forward to the next IOS update from Apple and hopefully they fix the battery management in that update. Everything else is super smooth.

            "I\u2019m pretty much satisfied with my purchase of this phone. For all those commenting on the battery life of this phone , it gives a decent 9-10 hrs backup after a full charge which is normally acceptable if u are not a phone frenzy.",
            "Very smooth functioning and battery part is average will work for 6-8 hours if you are moderate user.Camera is awesome overall worth buying and satisfied . complete package of this segment as it works on A13 bionic chip which makes performance better ...can go for it without thinking twice...",

You dont get a night mode in the camera but if you focus on an item and then increase the exposure you will get satisfactory photo in night.

Along with heating. Didn\u2019t expect this. FaceTime is heating up too a bit. As of positives? Well... iPhone users won\u2019t find anything problematic except what I noticed as above and get back their home sweet home button. For new iOS users things would be a breeze.

The delivery boy came & have not exchanged with the old phone saying glass has scratch & half of touchscreen is not working. Instead he forced to pay exchange value of Rs 3000. Even on cancellation these fraud platform is saying it will charge extra money on cancellation of EMI. This is the last product I am buying from Flipkart.

            "May end I decided to but this phone ! But I did research for one month and finally bought in last week on June. I have been using this device now more than three weeks. So I can give my two cents here.\n\nNote: I am a moderator user. I spent 70% of mobile time on YouTube. Then browsing, what\u2019s app and others. I play basic games such as sudoku, call break games. Hence my usage is moderate level.\n\nI love this phone. Everything is perfect. I know you are looking here about battery. My straight answer is it\u2019s very good as per my usage. I will give 4.5/5 to battery. It\u2019s small but do remember so does everything. It\u2019s a lcd screen i.e no oled, hence video play use less battery. Only thing I faced a bit of issue is battery consumption on video call. For 1.5 -2 hour battery drains near by 50-60% but again that\u2019s fine. Who talks that much ?\n\nApproximate Reference of battery from 100 to zero percent from my experience.\n\n- Prime videos : 2 movies easily in one charge\n- prime videos : 5-6 episode of 45 minute each\n- YouTube - I watch cricket videos for 1-2 hours. Battery drains by 30% appx\n\n\nWho should buy it: if you are someone who had never spent more than 30k on phone and now looking to take Apple. Go for it. Just order it.\n\nWho should not buy it :\n-if you are already an phone user who been using any set above I phone 8. No need to choose this. Go for 11. Tum logo pehle hi bhot ameer ho. Tum rehne do yeh!\n\n- if you are a hardcore gamer. Avoid it. If you play pub g once in one charging set, then yes you can think.",

Sad part is in just 15 days of use and hardly 16 to 18 charging cycle my batter health is now showing as 97%. Called apple care and they are telling it is normal.

I would honestly suggest you all to stay away from this device in 2021 unless there is a budget issue / you need a small form-factor device for one hand usage. The battery on this device is literally a shame, it dies out in 10 hours. I had to charge my new phone twice a day without any significant usage only minimal web browsing, few calls & app usage. I had done multiple factory resets, removed all the battery sucking apps, disabled animations, background app refresh and all the tips suggested by various forums. There is however an improvement post installing iOS 14.7 but not much. The battery drain on this device is significantly high. Even after showing it to Apple authorised service Center there is no respite. They had reset the phone and reinstalled it\u2019s software. I am left to use it now since I have exceeded the Flipkart 7 day return policy",

I got the 64GB ROM variant on 18th July at thirty two thousand Indian rupees but from 19th July onwards the rate has become twenty eight thousand Indian rupees.....

Battery life - a full charge lasts for about 12-16 hours only - needing me to charge it twice a day!\n2.

            "Amazing performance value for money writing this review after almost a month of usage :\nCamera- amazing quality competes with with some of the best android camera device such as one plus nord 2\nThe studio effect could use a little optimization otherwise completely packed\nDisplay- amazing crisp quality and true tone makes it even more amazing 750p dosent feel like 750p it feels better quality and bright even in sun light very nice for media consumption .\nSound- sound is as good as it gets on a phone you can hear details well sound is clear if you are watching content the top speaker which is used for reciving calls also blasts out audio and makes it much more immersive .\nPerformance- A13 can run every task or game you throw at it no doubt and is highly future proof even though its 2 years old even though games like BGMI are not optimised for this screen ratio but still you can play bgmi on ultra hd with ultra fps and it won\u2019t break a sweat .\nBattery- the battery can easily last you a whole day on a single charge if you don\u2019t play games as games seem to drain the battery quite fast , also I read some reviews regarding people comparing the battery backup with mosquito bats and trimmers so for these I would like to point out that the things you are comparing the phone with are used for only one work other than a phone which uses battery to run your tasks like calling , watching videos and stuff where you require multiple parts to works like speaker processor and vibrating motors and mic or camera which drain battery faster than a motor which is draining on a battery dedicated to run just that one motor on maybe different speeds.\nOverall- the phone is great to work with and for those who are new on ios it\u2019s a good starter phone if you expect the company to give you the performance of a flagship product in such low price you might have to face some cons cause everything has its downside and if you are sooo persistent on spoiling reviews because you are and android fan boy you should have bought from the main flagship range then you might even get better performance than this , also I would 110% recommend this phone to anyone who thinks it\u2019s good for them cause I myself switched to this phone from android and it\u2019s way smooth and nice experience , I have added some pics for sample if you like to see .",

( I had a 5s before and so I found that it was odd)\nTook a month to replace (went to apple service center and got it replaced)\n\nNow, the review of the replaced phone\n1. It is the only phone which is compact\n2. Battery is really small. I charge it 3x a day ( iam always in calls and i regularly check my emails and WhatsApp)\n3. No problems in performance\n4. Camera ( i usually do not click photos . But the autofocus is really in handy while taking quick shots)\n\nWHAT ABOUT iPhone SE (2020) in 2022?\nThe battery is the case where anyone would suffer the most. Even if u think you can manage it, you will blame yourselves later.\nI prefer to get a phone which has better battery. I got 128 gig for 29000. I think still in 2022, the offer is more or less the same. Try to wait for next gen iPhones or what abt seeing iphone 12 mini?",

Performance- butter smooth and lag free experience, the a13 chip is top notch processor and delivers ultimate performance and also multitasking is a breeze, heavy games are lag free.\n2. Camera - clicks the pictures way better than a beginners dslr, can click very good pictures with a good clarity\n3. Fast charging - supports fast charging upto 20w, charges 0-100% in around 80 min using a 20w adapter.\n\nCons:\nBattery - When using, charging gets down way faster than any other phones, it comes with a 1821 mah battery, though there is an optimisation it makes us feel that the charge comes down fastly. On continuous usage, getting hardly around 4-5 hours and not beyond that.\n\nVerdict:\nIt\u2019s a phone with power packed performance and at an affordable price. Guys with minimum daily usage of phones can go for it.\n\nHope that helps !!!",

I was shocked to the fact that I won\u2019t get charging adapter along with mobile and I need to buy it separately by investing 2k more and one more thing for new buyers they should keep in mind is that the phone doesn\u2019t have headphone jack and that\u2019s again a separate buy. When it comes to battery, it struggles to last for even a day which most of the android users may hate but the new apple adapter I have bought charges mobile fast but you shouldn\u2019t forget to carry your charger wherever u go.\n\nOverall it\u2019s a nice experience to switch from android to iPhone but it\u2019s bit a costly of an upgrade, there are both pros n cons n people should decide based on their priority if they have to chose this iPhone over number of higher end android mobiles at this price range",

The usb c cable does not fit older or standard iphone chargers, so you pretty much have to buy a new wall charger for this cable. This is only for the Iphone SE 2020 sold in India sadly :( as the US version contains earpods, charger and charging cable. Unfair and wrong on Apples part. But we cant do anything but complain :(\n\nAlso the exchange experience was horrible - the agent argued with me that it was me who needed to give him a passcode when the iphone showed create passcode screen as it was unlocked!! Inexperienced agents should not be sent to exchange iphones when they cant understand basic english.",

Had done a thorough research before settling for this phone as it fit my budget and my reason for getting into the Apple ecosystem. The phone does has its fare share of cons but the pros outweighs them.\nFirst of all the phone is not a replacement for any dslr or mirrorless camera. I believe none can take each others place so let\u2019s stop comparing them. But the pictures coming out of this phone are way better than those 64MP, 108MP phones, again proving that MP does not matter in digital devices if you\u2019re software is pathetic. Though this phone lacks a night mode which I feel is it\u2019s biggest con, as Night Mode is a software versatility and Apple could have added it to this phone without upgrading any hardware.\nNeed not say anything about the chip as it is the fastest among all, until this update of mine i.e June \u201821.\nAnother drawback of this phone is the miser battery capacity Apple has provided with the phone. It won\u2019t even last a day if you are a normal user. Which means you have to plug it at night before you go to sleep. Caution : Heavy gamers stay away from this as this is not a gaming device even though the chip and gui supports.\nAs a first Apple product I\u2019m quite satisfied with it.\n\nMight update my review after a few months of usage",

Don't worry about what people keep saying about the battery and worry too much about the form factor. Just use it! Much better than androids in this price range. Smooth experience. No lags or stutters. Coming from android small software changes takes a small learning curve. where sometimes i feel android is a little more user friendly. but that's nitpicking\n\nI've been using for 10 days now and coming from a 5.8\" stock android phone. I must say i'm loving the experience. Texting, calling, social media and streaming music and video gets me from 100% at 8am to about 30% at 9pm (ON WIFI). If you're constantly on your phone using (MOBILE DATA), then you will have to plug it in by evening. A must is a case and tempered glass if you looking to keeping your phone in good condition for a few years.\n\nOne hand is such a good feeling. the haptics on iPhones are the best I feel compared to other phones.\n\nThe choice of the SE2020 was between the pixel 4a and the only area the pixel lost is on official physical support as of now in India. Apple has better build quality and support IMO.\n\nIf you want a bigger screen... get the XR. Apple gonna support you for a few years down the line compared to android at this price range.",

Very delayed delivery and no proper response from the delivery team.\nThere is only one reply from the customer care saying the same thing that shows in the tracking system in the app. I couldn\u2019t find a higher authority to complain my query. Even the email complaint method is not present. Every time I had to speak to the same level of customer care and would get the same response.\nOriginal ETA was 2 days, but it took 2 weeks for them to deliver.",

            "Good deal if you're looking for a brand new, powerful iPhone under 35K. Been using it for over a month now and I am more than satisfied with the overall performance. The overall performance is solid. Faced no issues with games, multitasking, or web browsing. The display feels vibrant and rich, colors look great, pictures look crisp, and frame transition feels smooth. For a moderate user like me, the battery backup feels pretty solid. The phone easily lasts for over a day and a half after a full charge. Photos and videos captured from the camera look crisp and detailed, as long as there is ample light. It doesn't have a night mode. so photos captured in low-light don't look as good compared to other high-end phones, but by no means do they look bad.\n\nOverall, I am really happy with the iPhone SE 2020, especially the performance. Thanks to the A13 Bionic processor, the same processor used in the top-end iPhone 11, apps and games open instantly with no delays whatsoever. Navigating around the phone and web browsing feels super smooth.\n\nHowever, I just found the phone a little big when it arrived, maybe because I've upgraded from an iPhone 5s. Though I guess I'm used to the size by now. The iPhone SE 2020 feels compact and lightweight when its in your pocket. At times, Ive forgotten that the phone is in my pocket as its pretty lightweight. Besides, the phone fits perfectly in the hand, which makes it easy to use one-handed.",

Being not a heavy user it gives me about 5.5 hrs to 6.5 hrs of battery usage with casual gaming which is good for me.\n\nCons.\n1. Battery (Only 1821mah battery. For heavy gamers, I don't recommend this phone to them, though games are running very smooth in this phone.)\n2. Small Display (Those who like big 6.4+ inch display don't like this phone's display because its too small to play games and other stuffs.)\n3. Charging Time (2 to 2.5 hrs to full charge the phone from 0 to 100% when charged with in box charger.)\n\n#Opinion - This is my 1st iPhone and I personally liked it and I'm not so heavy user so it worked perfectly fine for me.

Overall a fair package, not for those who expect the best out of an iPhone.\n\nPS: would like to update my review after using the phone for 1.5months. The phone took some time to settle down, but jow performs like a beast. Gaming, application loading and many more features work seamlessly without glitch. Apple has many more features integrated in it, but in different ways. The only issue found was the battery life. If not in battery saver mode, the battery drains out pretty quickly and you will end up charging the phone more often. One more annoying thing is not having a location turn on/off button in control center. Rest all works seamlessly good.",

Form-Factor & Display size: For me the size is an upgrade & fits in a Hand or pocket perfectly. It falls in the Goldilocks zone nor too small nor too big.\n2. Camera: Can shoot 4K at 60 FPS, Takes crisp images & has a brilliant processor from the iPhone 11 that stitches the image together. For me this is all I need\n3. Processor: A13 bionic I don\u2019t have to say more\n4. Battery: Everyone told me about how underpowered battery was and they may be right, But for me it has been a non-issue given my Usage style and the built-in Wireless charging option gets me through my day without plugging in and any battery Anxiety\n5. Storage : 126 GB + Cloud Storage (WD My cloud of 3 TB in my case) is beyond what I will ever use\n6. Dual Sim: The e-Sim & Nano SIM has been my blessing, in a Post-Pandemic era it takes care of my Work-Life balance without adding the hassle of carrying an additional device.\n7. Practicality : After over a month of usage when the Novelty is over It continues to be a very practical product since it fits in the ecosystem perfectly. Checks all boxes just right !\n\nWho shouldn\u2019t buy this Phone\nGamers, Social-Media addicts, Basically Battery Guzzlers of all kinds .. even if budget was a constrain This phone is not for you.\n\nWho Should Consider\nPeople who exactly know what they expect from a smart phone , Who appreciate the convenience of an Apple Eco-System , People who need an efficient Phone.\n\nTip: Don\u2019t look at it as a \u201cBudget iPhone\u201d it\u2019s a convenient iPhone.",

My calculations were simple\n1. A phone that fits in my pocket easily.\n2. As I normally use phones for 5 years atleast. Around 5 years of software & security updates.\n3. Smooth Performance for daily tasks for longer term.\n4. Scanning documents and recording quick short videos with ease. And\n5. Smooth integration with my iPad and Asus Laptop.\n\nThis phone checks all the boxes. Instead of changing 10k Android phone after every one or two years, this seemed logical.\n\nOf course there are cons to this phone such as battery performance and apple charging for few things which are free on Android ( Video Casting etc.). But those can be overcome eventually.\n\nMy verdict: If you are getting latest iPhone around 20k just buy it.\n\nTip: For better Battery Performance switch off Siri",

Using Samsung Flagships for past few years S6to S10+(Still have it).\nGot the latest A13 bionic chip and cheapest 26k iPhone, so without waiting immediately purchased it.\nHere are the Pros:\n1. Apple brand. Yes it feels premium holding in hand !\n2. The 1821mAh battery keeps the phone well charged for a day of normal usage(3hrs of net and online shopping surfing+30 mins of Appld music+1 Mirzapur2 episode+4incomming calls total apprx 30 mins+5 outgoing calls total apprx 35 mins and one WhatsApp video call of 8 mins still have 17%)\n3. As mentioned I am using S10+, yes Apple's 4.7\"LCD screen seems to be on lower side. But trust me it doesn't matter. Normal daily usage will work fine and that is why they have given this so small battery!\n4. Call and music sound quality is good and the headphones provided are also very good.\n5. Camera image processing is awesome. It wont let u down of being single lens.\n\nCons:\n1.Charger. 5 watt?! Why apple? It take 110 mins to do 90%charge!\n2. All accessories are too much expensive!",

            "I think, this is the best mobile phone presently in the market. Other mobile phone being Samsung M01/M11.\nRest of the smart phones from all other companies are actually Phablets, not mobile phone at all! 6.67\" Phones were called Tablets or Phablets not few years ago!\n\nI am not particularly Apple fan, but I think, this phone with this form factor is just awesome. Can carry in any of your pockets ( pants, shirts) and do any activities like walking, running etc. Not possible with all other Phablets!\n\nSome people may not like it for video consumption, or playing games. I use a projector or 43\" TV for video consumption and go to theatre for video consumption. I dont play games, so for me, this was the best mobile phone.\n\nIt takes very good photos, even under water. I have tried and took many pictures. It has IP67 rating, may not be water proof, but one can surly do few minutes of under water photography without any worry. and Thats enough. Those 48MP, 64MP are just good to hear. In any case, when I have to take some photographs, I use a full frame DSLR.\n\nSo, if you are looking for a phone, not for consumption video contents and playing games, but for smartphone activities like check emails, do some social media, take better photos, charge once a day, make and receive calls with ease, IPHONE SE ( 2020) is the best phone!",

            "Good camera and performance and good price",
            "The best compact smartphone ever made. And when that smartphone is from Apple then nothing much to say. Phone is currently running extremely smooth. Battery life is below average. Camera quality on the rear is almost at par with its biggest sibling 11 pro max. Performance - The most powerful chip before A14 bionic arrived. Finally I have entered the Apple Ecosystem and just falling for it again and again...My first iPhone??",
            "I would not suggest this phone, being an apple user for years, this phone has battery issues and not worth to buy",

            "Thanks Flipkart",
            "What would I say about Apple product. I won\u2019t say much about IOS, camera , performance, you can check YouTube for that, but you as a user experience then you can refer this comment.\n1) Camera is good in daylight , in artificial light you will really not be happy so if camera is your priority then don\u2019t go for it. For front camera same comment don\u2019t buy it if you are too much into social media.\n2) Performance - No one can beat this phone in performance even iPhone 11, you can play any game with no lag. And you will get an update for next 5 year.\n3) Battery- It is not at all good, if you are a heavy user then you have to charge after half day usage but the good thing is it gets charged 50% in 30 minute with fast charger.\n4) Size - If you don\u2019t like big phone then this phone is for you, my main reason of buying this phone is the size, you won\u2019t feel that you are carrying a phone in your pocket. Don\u2019t get confused with the bezel you will not get trouble with that.\n5) IOS- No android phone can match iOS, even stock android. If privacy is your priority then go for iPhone. Personally i feel privacy and security is most important more than camera , battery, size. Experience of iOS is so smooth i have not have a single glitch till now while using this phone. It\u2019s completely premium experience.\nAs a while you can\u2019t compare iPhone with any other phone in security, privacy and premium OS.",
            "Not worth for the money.",

            "It\u2019s just Awesome. Got it on big billion day sale for 26. It\u2019s a beast, with unbeatable performance. It\u2019s battery life is really good for a normal user. Camera and build quality as usual awesome. It\u2019s the fastest smallest phone in the world and if you need performance you can go for it. It\u2019s wireless charging and ip67 water resistant features really makes the user comfortable. People think it\u2019s just a 60hz screen with lcd display but it\u2019s not so. The screen is really so awesome and it\u2019s so fast and you can only feel the smoothness while using it. It can run with max graphics and FPS in all the apps whatever you use. I think this is the best flagship in 2020 which is worth more than this price and if you wish then surely go for it. And one more thing i just got it with a charger and EarPods too, instead of spending for it separately. :)",

Sometimes single camera on rear shows that how much poor you are.\n\nBuy it if you want an Iphone..you can buy this as a secondary phone.. otherwise go for iphone 11 if u have money.

Overall it is good for a student like me although it may not be a good choice for a business man because of it\u2019s small size of the battery which may drain quickly.

If it\u2019s just social media every now and then, you\u2019ll make it through the day. Given the new work from home scenario for most people, I doubt if plugging your phone in for charging towards the end of the day would be much of an issue. As long as you don\u2019t compare it with any other phone, you\u2019ve got an absolute peach of a smartphone. It already is breaking all sales records for Apple, so that definitely should be an indicator. Best advice would be to try out the phone at a store, and then decide.\n\nP.S. - I have been an Android user ever since the LG G2, and my last phone was the Samsung Galaxy S10.

The camera is just awesome which is an usual thing for iphones.\n2. The a13 bionic chipset is super fast .. can easily perform multitasking and can literally play any game on app store\n3. Its my first ios device and i simply love the privacy and security it provides us\n4. Being a 1800 mah battery it provides pretty decent backup i get around 5-6 hours of screen time which is more than enough for my daily usage\n5. The form factor .. it feels sleek and it is perfect for single hand usage\n\nCons-\n1. Battery could have been better but no complaints since i can use it a whole day after a full charge\n2. Display is quite outdated size wise but being a lcd display still performs better than any midrange oled out there",

It is light and compact.\nSW and performance : once you update to iOS 14 it gives lot of additional features. Performance is excellent with A13 chip and the phone never stutters.\nCamera : Pretty good in daylight. Yet to test the low light performance. Video is very good as well.\nBattery : I have seen reviews that battery is not good. But for my usage at the end of the day I am left with about 40% which is good enough.\nScreen : my main phone is OnePlus 6 with 6.28 inch AMOLED screen. So the 4.7 inch LCD is small and contrast level is not comparable. However as a stand alone device it is decent and bright. Advantage of small screen is it is usable with 1 hand.\n\nAll in all it is good value as I got it for about 25k during big billion days.",

I saw a lot of reviews were people received locked phones, phones that were not exactly what were described, and phones that were damaged. Also people had received phones that did not work up to par. However, these reviews were only a small margin of the overall reviews. I bit the bullet thinking maybe I could just return it if it wasn't what I wanted. It came in original Apple packaging, was unlocked and worked with my Sim card immediately, and is exactly what I was looking for. I'm beyond pleased with this phone so far. I've only had it for under a week at this point. Chances are I will update this review in a few months as to whether or not my satisfaction changes. I expect to get at least two years out of this phone if I treat it right. And I hope my review helps other concerned consumers make the right choice for them.

            "Rewriting my review after 25 days of use. I got one plus 7t and I phone se at the same time. Sadly the I phone loses the battle by a very large margin. The beautiful amoled display, gaming performance, battery back up, brilliant camera and clean oxygen OS outperform the I phone. The I phones small and dull display, average camera and battery doesn't give you a feel to watch a video or read a document. I just don't feel like doing anything smart on this so called luxurious I phone. All you have is a brand logo at the back and a decent phone to make calls. A cheap Chinese phone less than 10k has far better display, battery and overall utility features. I phone se is just a name, nothing of a special thing it boasts. So if you just need a Chinese phone worth 6k with an Apple logo behind, this is your right choice !",

            "Beautiful phone. Single camera is not great, but for sure the usability of it with the power of a13 chip is good. Plus very simple and easy to hold in hand without dropping it.\nNo need of a back cover as it's easily held in hand.\nLoved it more than my 11 Pro. Flipkart sale was awesome, I got the best deal for waiting to buy this phone for a long long time. I got it at a deal of 30k after all discounts. Brilliant one for the price point. Best phone for any one. Thank you Flipkart for making my dream phone affordable for me.",

No doubt the A13 Bionic chip is simply flawless.\nOne thing you need to keep in mind while buying this particular beast: battery backup is really low! For that you can keep a power bank!\nExcept the battery backup, the phone is really unmatched and top in performance. Great pick instead of One plus Nord!!\nPicture quality is really great with so many options in it.\nI\u2019m writing this review after using for 15days.",

            "Got this product at 23K during recent sale, i must say for this price this product is worth every penny. However, the cons for this products are :\n1. Feels 5 year old technology with all of the bezels and finger print lock\n2. Feel really small as compared to display of other phones at this price range.\n3. Display being LCD, felt little inferior to Iphone 7(my previous phone)\n4. Battery back up is not huge, not sure whether this is an side effect of IOS 14. (My suggestion is not to move to iOS 14)",

Ios 14 is just amazing and for 26000 you get the fastest processor in the market which is just next level. Totally satisfied",

            "Bought it for 20K with exchange during BBD sales. Best performing device in that price range.\n\nDesign is old and could be a deal breaker for many but this design has its perks too. Extremely comfortable to hold and type. One hand usage is a pleasure and it sits in your pocket like you're not even carrying any phone with you. Stereo speakers sound great but media consuming experience is bad due to the tiny screen and big bezels.\n\nWe have a single camera at the back and it's very reliable to click great photos in good or artificial lighting conditions. Though no night mode hurts its performance in low light but installing neural cam may help in some scenarios.\n\nOverall at a price of 20k it's a great device to get into apple ecosystem and test some of the lastest features of iOS.",

            "I don\u2019t usually write reviews, but man ! This is a great phone ! So had to write one !\n\nDisplay: If you think this LCD panel is comparable to others you find on normal androids, you\u2019re wrong. Retina display is really good. Of course not as good as Amoled, but trust me, it\u2019s not gonna disappoint you !\n\nBattery life : somewhat less, but easily lasts a day, as opposed to what some youtubers been complaining. I watch some YouTube, play a couple rounds of video games and then some surfing. Easily lasts entire day for me. If you want huge battery life, go buy an inverter or a samsung phone.\n\nPerformance: A13 Bionic chip is a piece of art ! Way better than the top chipset (SD865) found on android phone. I wonder why apple never showcases it as a gaming beast ?! When it is !. Absolutely 0 lag when playing on top settings.\n\nCamera: The only phones that have better camera are other iPhones and pixel (somewhat) . Do not debate about megapixels , trust me ! This bad boy packs a single back camera, but damnit ! The photos that it clicks are unmatched ! Idk how but seriously.. it\u2019s magical. Even videos, you can shoot upto 4K 60fps !!\n\nScreen size: now this is debatable. I, for one, like to have a phone I can operate with one hand, and this is perfect for me. Infact I love the form factor . But maybe some people do like big phones to overcompensate for their little brains . Just kidding ..;) .... or am I ? O_o\n\nHeadphone jack: yep. This sure is annoying. I did although get earpods in box, but I guess they stopped giving those out, recently. Considering this is a budget phone, not a good move :( anyways, Bluetooth headphones are really cheap these days, so it\u2019s not that big of a problem.\n\nSecurity: This is why people buy apple. Your data is YOUR DATA. No snooping, no selling user behaviour to ad companies. Love this ! But definitely, it has a price tag to it. Its a choice you have to make...\n\nOverall impression: Go for it !!",

If ur using it with vodafone or airtel go into settings of sim & change the mode from 4d to 3g under data settings as the 4g uses more battery but 3g uses less though u will get a data speed of 3mbps but thats just fine for youtube & rest of the social app to work smoothly...",

Apple say about A13 chip and all these but the reality is once you start using it , it drains off as fast as it can.\nSpend so much for some thing with very less battery back up is not worth\nBrought the phone last week and charged it for full started using it , no video games, no app running in background , only very few calls made, with in 5-6 hours battery went down.\n\nUltimately if u dont have battery back then what Is the use in Having other features",

            "Battery is pathetic",
            "After researching for over 4month.\nI decided to buy iphone Se(2020). On this billion days.\nOrdered the 128gb varient. Now I have some things to tell regarding the phone.\n\nFirst of all its an iPhone which every one should keep in mind. Iphone is always the best except it's pricing in india.\nType of iphone models always depends on person to person and the type of use.\nI have given a 5 star rating which I will justify below.\n\n1. Display : My friend has OnePlus 7T . He having such a big phone and large super amoled display with full hd plus panel was stock with the display the iphone SE offered .\nIphone SE's display is crystal clear. It is at a par with OnePlus 7t's display.\nSo no comments on iphone display resolution ,and pixel density from my end . It's great.\n\n2. Camera : Single rear camera system capturing stunning photos. Having optional image stabilization.\nPortrait mode will make you happy.\nSo, 2,3,4,5 cameras are not important what's important is the quality and it's optimization.\n3. A13 bionic chip gives super smooth performance.\n\n\n4. Battery : The most talked about part.\nAccording to my point it's okay. Why ?\nI am using it as a secondary device.\nA person like me will be happy with its battery life.\nIt gives a decent backup. I am no complain.\n\n5. 128gb varient in 33k is worthy.\nHowever, 64 gb is not worthy because in apple store apps sizes are larger than in android store. So, 128gb always safe and a step ahead for long use.\n\nThe only thing which is little bad is the thick bezels.\nI personally have no problem because I like small iphones it's very handly and the bezels don't not change my taste.\n\nSo, according to me SE as the name suggests will not disappoint you at all if you buy it.",

            "This review giving after 7 days of use from the date of purchase (got this product on 17 oct). Awesome, superb, insane phone. Bought many products from Flipkart but this is the best deal I ever had. Very much happy n satisfied with the product this phone got everything u need good display, camera, smooth touch, performance, most important privacy security, etc. you will get to know more after using it. No regret after buying iPhone SE small phone in year 2020, though it\u2019s screen is small and has only 1 camera but not an issue for me because it\u2019s display quality is awesome everyone will love it, according to my hand size i like handy and slim phones. And the most important it\u2019s battery life, honestly telling I didn\u2019t have any issues with the battery life because I am not a gamer so it gives me backup of more than 12 hrs in 100% charge that\u2019s enough for me in an iPhone. So if you\u2019re not a gamer and if u like slim n handy phone plus fingerprint lock then u can definitely go for it, u won\u2019t regret after buying. At 1st i was thinking of buying XR and then I don\u2019t know what happened i got confused between XR n SE which one to buy, then after thinking a lot i decided to go for SE 2020 because it has fingerprint lock. And i can save my money too. From the difference amount i can buy Airpods that will be very useful to me. So as I decided i did that and now I\u2019m happy n totally satisfied with the decision i took.\nThank you Flipkart big billion days and to the seller #supercomnet for giving me such a great deal and 100% original product.",

I have been using this for 5 days and privacy and security is the best in apple devices even the 64 gb model is more than sufficient for a person like me and ios 14 rocks and i must mention it will be getting uptades more than the XR and X which were launched 2 3 years ago.

If you are a person who is constantly making Audio/Video calls, then the battery will last only 1 day. All in all, a very good phone for 25000 rupees. Compared to Android, the security features and privacy features are better in iPhone hence it is better to pay a little extra and be safe.",

(This is my personal opinion not that I'm apple fan boy I'm a hardcore Android user) I would I don't need a display with notch, punch hole this is the perfect fit for me now let's get to battery life this is the serious issue battery life is really bad but I made a mindset while purchasing this that I need a IOS device with powerful processor and great camera so I focused on that and each and every thing on this world have good and bad side so that's my opinion and lastly the main feature that only iPhone give no other phone on this planet give that is vibration feedback means haptic feedback this is best in this phone...",

But thats okay once work from office resumes no need to do that i guess(pun)\n\nIn short this is intended for ppl who will use mostly for calls and a bit of social interaction and casual gamer(all games will run very smoothly) as battery and small screen will be a issue for serious gamers.\n\nFor someone switching from Android let me tell you I used android for 8 years and hands down IOS has got me .\nThey kept it simple and on point. Yes will miss some features of android but its very very secure .\nDidnt got a chance to take photos outside else would have updated.\nNot upto mark for low light photography but it manages somehow.\nRAM management is very good no lags no flickering whatever you throw at it.\nIf you can manage this go for it surely hands down.\nThanks",
            "Hello,\n\nI bought this during the BBD sale in October at the price of 26k and with exchange and Credit card discount came to 19.3k. iPhone at this price that too a newly launched one is very Awesome. The Box contains the Headphones and Charger in the Box (not provided by Apple after iPhone 12 launch). As I already was having an iPhone 7, it was easy to move to this one as the backup restore made it same as my old phone.\n\nOnly issue was the reduction of the Exchange value by Rs.2700/- for a very small dent (which was due to a case). I was not happy with Flipkart for reducing such a huge amount for just a very small dent. The old iPhone 7 was in excellent condition otherwise and I would have liked to get the mentioned exchange value which was correct in my opinion (not high and not too low).\n\nThe performance is very good and the videos taken at 4k 60 fps was awesome. The space will not be enough to shoot more 4k videos as I went in for 64gb model. If you are into Videos and Photos, then go for bigger storage option.\n\nBuild - Awesome glass build with wireless charging and IP 67 rating.\nDisplay - Very high quality 720p 4.7' LCD screen (But at this price, I'm okay). But Not for binge watching and game play.\nCamera - Awesome camera (only issue is no night mode & No portraits of objects can take portraits of human subjects only).\nSize - Compact (which is why I went for this model).\nCall quality - Stereo speakers so loud and clear. You may need to get an e-Sim for 1 slot and can have only 1 physical sim.\nPerformance - A13 Bionic is a very good flagship processor along with iOS which will let you have a good experience for atleast 3 years to come.\nBattery - Not good for power users. Okay for 1 day though. Supports Fast charging upto 18W and wireless charging at 7.5W.\nGaming - A13 Bionic will support all games available in the app store now and will be fast enough for everyone. Though I'm not a gamer, I can say this phone will support all high end games.\n\nOverall a satisfying buy (except for the issue with the exchange). Don't buy if you are expecting a great battery life if you are gaming.",

Second, I wanted a phone that would last for atleast four-five years. This phone is certainly compact (frankly I'd have appreciated a newer model the same size as the original SE) and easy to use one-handed. It's also very well built and blazingly fast, so I'm sure with proper care it should last a long time.\n\nOn the negative side, the battery life is poor. I'm not a heavy user. I don't play games or do a lot of photography. On an average day, I might watch a few youtube videos and listen to about an hour of audio. With this level of usage the battery is just enough to last me through the day, forget lasting more than one. So if you use your phone heavily or travel a lot, do not get this phone.",

            "If you are thinking of buying this phone then my review will give you some honest advice.\n\nCAMERA:- The camera is just ok. I don't know why all the youtubers were saying that camera was excellent. I found it ok. The only great thing about the camera is that you can record 4k in 60fps.\n\nDisplay:- Display is not amoled. But you can never say that the display is poor. I even find it better than some of the amoled displays on mid range redmi and realme phones. But on full brightness you can feel the videos are gray. The display size is insanely small that is 4.7 inches.\n\nDesign:- The design is old but not outdated. The phone is tough. Dropping it will not break it easily. This phone feels so much premium in hands. This is the phone you don't want to put somewhere. You always want to keep it in your hands. The design is a little old but awesome.\n\nPerformance:- With the A13 Bionic Chipset this phone is way ahead of all the other phones in this price section. You can run any app which is possible to run on a phone. Its one of the most powerful phones in the market right now. You can compare its performance with any flagship of any company.\n\nPrice:- Since i got this for Rs26,000 during the sale i will say this is the best thing you can get at this price.",

Yes, it is a small device with the screen considerably smaller than present generation models, but it is for those who love smaller devices. Only negative I felt was that the edges are more than one would expect (the home button occupying bottom and the camera and ear piece at the top). Overall, at a relatively lower price tag, I believe the mobile is a good choice for its smaller form factor.\nEdit: As everyone has been complaining, the battery is the deal breaker here. It takes forever to charge from zero to 100! In the age of super fast and ultra super fast chargings, this age old approach from apple and that too at a premium price is seriously a crime in technological era! And combine that with no adapter and ear pods hence forth is a sure shot deal breaker!!",

The feel is very premium and lives up to the apple name tag. This was my first apple phone, and after using it for some time, I could clearly feel the difference in this and an android phone. It can\u2019t be explained with words easily. Go for it, if u need a new phone and u get it at this special price!\n\nHowever, if u are addicted to changing themes and customising your phone very frequently, it would be better that you stick with android. If u only like customising accessories or covers, then you will find more and better options for apple products!",

I personally preferred this phone over iPhone 11 just because I was an average user, who uses his smartphone just for YouTube and Instagram, occasionally I take photos... And that's it.... If u don't like small screen and want bigger battery for long gaming hours... Then I recommend u to consider iPhone 11.... I love small phones because I have have small pair of hands... This phone gives me around 5 to 6 hours of screen on time every day which is more than enough for me...",

            "Let me clear this question first\n\nDo we get the adapter and earphones ? Yes , the box contains the earphones and the charging adapter along with the cable\n\nNow coming to the mobile, this is an excellent mobile overall.\n1. For those who wants to move from Android to iOS this would be the best purchase as a first time experience.\n2. The design is excellent. It's pretty sleek and pretty light weight. I have purchased Product (RED) and it's just brilliant\n3. Processor is like damn fast. No lags nothing. Just premium\n4. Cameras are top notch. Night mode is just good, but just think how many times you would click pictures at night ? The pictures in the daylight are just excellent.Portrait shots are on par with many high end phones\n5. The size of the phone is what I love the most. Vexed up with the bigger phones, this is a life saver. So easy to hold and use\n6. iOS - This is the biggest pro of any iPhone and this one too. The new security features that are given in the latest iOS14 are no match to the Android Security. Just brilliant\n\nBattery might be a major concern for many, but I get a screen time of around 6-7 hours which I believe should be more than enough. Why do you want to use a phone for more than 7 hours per day. Haha\n\nOther noteworthy things - You get a 1 year of apple tv plus subscription and 1 year of warranty\n\nThe only issue I have faced is with activating iMessage and Facetime but the apple support damn its so good that I have got it resolved within a day or so.\n\nDo whatever you do perfectly - This phone redefines it. Go for it",

            "I am a first time iPhone user. I've been using android since Android 2.3. I'm still using Android through Samsung Galaxy Note 8 as my primary phone.\n\nSo my review should help any prospective iPhone users to make the right decision.\n\nOverall summary - A good phone to begin your iPhone experience. I bought it during BBD festival offer & for the phone for Rs28000 after discount. No I didn't exchange any phone for it. Ordered on Thursday night around 11pm. Phone delivered Saturday afternoon.\n\nPros.\n1. Size - 4/5 I was apprehensive first to buy 4.7\" screen iphone since I was using big screen of Note 8. But to my surprise, the phone is not that small as I imagined. It's compact & the screen size is also good enough. Initially, the experience would be different but nevertheless it would be a good experience. The bezel is the only slight which could have been avoided. But this is iphone 8 except for the internal specs change. So just a small compromise.\n\n2. Display - 5/5 I couldn't notice any difference between iPhone's LCD display & the Samsung's LED display with naked eye observations under normal conditions for any user.. Obviously, at maximum resolution & maximum brightness, Samsung display was way better. But I'm not going to use the phone in that settings & conditions. So it doesn't matter. The display is clear. Colors are vivid. Truetone technology definetly gives more accurate skin tones. Best display at this price. (please note the expert reviews and ratings that you see in YouTube are all based on extreme settings and not based on normal user settings & conditions.)\n\n3. Camera - 5/5 this is the same primary camera from iPhone 11. It's an iPhone camera. So definetly it is different. Even the expert reviews in YouTube have concluded the same. Except for some very minute details missing. But that's OK. This is below 30k phone. Iphone 11 is atleast a 50k phone. So no complaints whatsoever.\n\n4. Performance - 4/5.the processor & ram are is the same as iPhone 11. So it's supposed to be the best performance. But it's just that after I've been using Galaxy Note 8 for nearly 3 years, I felt the phone is slightly slower. But it is obvious to expect because Note 8 has a Octa core processor. iPhone se 2020 has a hexa core processor. But in a week or so, you'll get used to the pace of the phone and it won't be a problem. (please note there is no Octa core iphone) . The latest iPhone 12 is also hexa-core. So performance cannot be compared. Youtube comparisons are not for normal layman user experience. They'll use the phone for 2 weeks and will post a review and then will never use the phone. But you're buying a new phone to use it for atleast next 3 years of its an iPhone\n\n5. OS - 3/5 - this is the biggest disappointment of all. Except for so called \"privacy\" & \"security\", there is nothing that I found good in iOS 14. If everything was uploaded to icloud and as we have seen in the past, icloud is hackable I don't understand how is it secure. Especially transferring selective data from Android to iPhone, file management, photos management, cloud back up management & app library management are some of the things I found very difficult to do. Transferring photos into iPhone externally is one of the harrowing experience I have gone through recently. If this is your first ever smartphone, then this is the best phone. But if you are coming from nearly a decade of Android experience with obviously considerable amount of data, iOS will frustrate you plenty of times. In my opinion, iOS is absolutely not at all a welcoming & user friendly OS whatsoever. May be in long run you will get used to it.\n\nIn conclusion, anybody who wants to experience an iPhone & then decide whether to buy a Rs1lac phone 2-3 years down the time, then go for it.. Have the experience & then decide for yourselves.. Low expectations will definitely help you a long way.",

But instead of that this phone built quality is wonderful and have no regrets of spending 25k.\nOnly con is the underpowered battery. Which dies in 10 hours of moderate use.\nIt's glass on the back and a huge camera bump so I Immediately bought a case for the safety and a matte screen protector which costed me around 750 combined.",

The moment I started it , it got the iOS 14 update and is running amazing . This is a good strategy by apple , to sell a cheaper phone , which is high in quality to get people hooked to the apple ecosystem. I can safely say I am happy with this phone , but then it's a secondary phone for me, not because it's bad , it's just that the battery capacity it has , I doubt it will suffice as a primary phone with my usage.\n\nThe phone supports fast charging, but apple has bundled a slow charger as always, so go and buy the fast charger from apple and this phone will charge like a charm.\n\nPerformance, feel wise it's a fab phone, and ya about the screen, it's proper for the battery I feel and I didn't feel as such it's too small. This screen size feels just perfect.",

I will not spend time on that.\nEverywhere it is written or said that phone has very poor battery life. It is true for someone who plays lots of games or views lots of videos on his phone. I purchased this phone around 25K for my father and trust me with basic internet browsing and other phone applications battery life is okay, after full charge in the morning my father comes home with 60-70% remaining battery. If you are getting this phone under 27k, this is a good deal, I mean,you are basically buying iPhone 11 inside Iphone 8's body except few camera functions and large display.\nI am using iOS (First gen iPhone SE) for 3 years. Android performance fades as phone gets older but I haven't experienced a single lag on iOS till now. So below 30k, you can think about iPhone SE.",

This is much more value for money than iPhone 11 because there is a 20000+ price difference for very few features. This can do almost everything the same and it's the cheapest and best option to get into the iOS environment.\n\nIf you have a budget for a phone, the iPhone SE is definitely a top choice. It's much better than most Android phones for the same price and you'll need to pay much more to get the same performance on Android. I switched to iPhone SE after using Android phones for 10 years.",

            "Tis is a good phone.",
            "I bought SE 2020 from flipkart bbd and i got it at a very good price. I have always used android but i must say that SE is far better than most of the android mobile which comes in this price segment. Some of the issues that people have with SE 2020 and my view on that issues:\n1.Battery - I think that battery life is pretty decent. It lasts full day for me. I use my mobile for social media apps, youtube ,music, prime and all the other basic mobile functions. I am not a heavy mobile gamer so battery is not a problem for me.\n2. Screen size and bazzels : I feel that the bazzels are big but that is the thing i already know before buying. so its totally your decision if you like bazzels or not, but the screen quality beats many hd and full hd screens available in market. Thumbs up for that.\n3. Gaming : This device is not for heavy gamers although every game runs perfectly without any frame drop but the screen size is the problem. Lite games can be played easily.\nWhat are the things that I like the most?\n1. First of all the mobile is launched in 2020 so i will get ios update at least for next 4 years.\n2. I don't know about previous IOS versions but ios 14 is awesome. It is the whole package. It comes with so much cool features like shortcuts, double tap, triple tap gesture from the back etc. definitely check them out or watch some video you will get the idea.\n3. It is light weight and can be operated via single hand.\n4. Camera performance is next level. You might have already heard about iphone cameras(don't go on megapixel of camera).\n5. It has many other advantages like security, privacy, no hickups , best ram management etc.",
            "Nice phone",
            "today in first day some heating issue during software updating, now it is okay lest see after few days. delivery is very quick and delivery person also very nice.\n21-10-2020\nbattery life as expected. value for money.",

Other than that, in good lighting, the camera takes some premium clicks/captures.\n\nInsane phone, insane user experience as is the case is with all Apple products. Feels extremely premium. It\u2019s a proper work/business phone. Not good for content consumption or games, only because of the small screen size. If you can live with it, then it\u2019s 100% fine.\n\nBattery is not that bad as everyone claims it is. Yes it\u2019s not that good, but with the iPhone you don\u2019t have to use your phone a lot to get work done, and it\u2019s standby time is incredible. So in that sense, the battery life seems pretty okay.\n\nOverall a good business/work phone, if all you want is seamless performance and a good user experience. It gets all the basics right.",

BIG DISCLAIMER, not a gamers phone, a good phone for any Apple ecosystem lover. Overall a decent buy.Only regret bought it 2 months prior to the sale so paid a premium extra of 6-7k compared to current big billion sale.",
