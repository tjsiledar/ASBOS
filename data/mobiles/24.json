The bettery is good but still my 2 years old phone gives more screen on time than this.\nPerformance is good but software is not that good.\nThat's it, it is a really good smartphone.\nBattery:- I am getting battery backup same as of my 2 years old smartphone in this brand new smartphone (my old smartphone also has 5000mah bettery). So not that good.\nHope we get Android 12 as soon as possible with stable software. And get updates to Android 15 with stable software. Than I will rate it 5\n\nCamera sucks! My Redmi 8's camera is better than This!. The camera sensor is good but the colours, optimization is what makes the camera very average.",
