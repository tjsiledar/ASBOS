Screen & display is ok but i don't find anything great with amoled screen\n2. Lot of bloat ware some of them are hard to remove. for e.g. google pay, gallery app etc\n3. Not a gamer so can't comment on the performance.\n4. Camera is bad. Very bad and even in day light lot of noise in the picture.\n5. Speakers are worse. Even though it says dual stereo speakers but performance wise keeping on high volume it is low and also not having clarity with tones. Literally I need to keep the phone close to hear while talking to someone.\n6. Battery is decent\n7. Didn't find heavy compared to m2 pro but didn't feel grippy without use case. Felt slippery without using the case provided.\n8. Color is bit darker compared with poco m4 pro 5g even though both are mentioned cool blue.\n9. Software wise i found even issues for e.g. when i set app to run in background but still the app is closed after some time.I play music all night while sleeping which is quite annoying.\n\nDelivery was good but experience with flipkart customer service team is bit of nightmare this time :(\n\nWill keep update further more about the phone performance and also with once gcam app installed with comparison with stock one.\n\nFor the price spent its not at all worth. I suggest don't buy this poco at all.\n\nI hope flipkart team wont modify my rating and reviews.",

            "Hi I am writing this review after using a 5 days. While using very first day I have not got proper battery backup, but after 2 days phone internally got settled and giving good battery backup. If u r a heavy user also it will give u one day battery.\nNet charging 33watt charger is really amazing, it is charging the 1hr - 1hr 5min for full charging\nCamera : in this main camera 64 mp camera, but after I have taken some pictures I observe it is not performing much well and even I am not feeling it is 64mp. After enabling AI feature in camera it improved lot more, but still require so much improvement from software side I am feeling it personally. Remaining 2 back cameras, I am not talking about these because I am not using these cameras mostly. And front camera also not upto the mark it need to perform much more I am thinking here also due to software problem.\nSterio speakers: these sterio speakers are not loud enough and even not performing like single speaker and the sound also not even in both speaker compare with bottom speaker head speaker little lesser sound output.\nProcessor g96 is decent processer and is handling all type games good and well as budget considering.\nOver all phone look and in hand feel is very good and feeling lite weight in hand and stilish back design attracting lot more.\n\nAnd finally I am telling it is a good battery phone with decent performance and good look and need little more software optimisation.",

Literally I need to keep the phone close to hear while talking to someone.\n6. Battery is decent\n7. Didn't find heavy compared to m2 pro but didn't feel grippy without use case. Felt slippery without using the case provided.\n8. Color is bit darker compared with poco m4 pro 5g even though both are mentioned cool blue.\n9. Software wise i found even issues for e.g. when i set app to run in background but still the app is closed after some time.I play music all night while sleeping which is quite annoying.\n\nDelivery was good but experience with flipkart customer service team is bit of nightmare this time :(\n\nWill keep update further more about the phone performance and also with once gcam app installed with comparison with stock one.\n\nFor the price spent its not at all worth. I suggest don't buy this poco at all.\n\nI hope flipkart team wont modify my rating and reviews.",

            "Hi I am writing this review after using a 5 days. While using very first day I have not got proper battery backup, but after 2 days phone internally got settled and giving good battery backup. If u r a heavy user also it will give u one day battery.\nNet charging 33watt charger is really amazing, it is charging the 1hr - 1hr 5min for full charging\nCamera : in this main camera 64 mp camera, but after I have taken some pictures I observe it is not performing much well and even I am not feeling it is 64mp. After enabling AI feature in camera it improved lot more, but still require so much improvement from software side I am feeling it personally. Remaining 2 back cameras, I am not talking about these because I am not using these cameras mostly. And front camera also not upto the mark it need to perform much more I am thinking here also due to software problem.\nSterio speakers: these sterio speakers are not loud enough and even not performing like single speaker and the sound also not even in both speaker compare with bottom speaker head speaker little lesser sound output.\nProcessor g96 is decent processer and is handling all type games good and well as budget considering.\nOver all phone look and in hand feel is very good and feeling lite weight in hand and stilish back design attracting lot more.\n\nAnd finally I am telling it is a good battery phone with decent performance and good look and need little more software optimisation.",
