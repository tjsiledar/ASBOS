            "Best selfie on this segment\n1. Design is excellent its slim and lightweight\n2. Display is perfect amoled and 90hz is smooth brightness is good enough. Always on display is here.\n3. Battery is good even with 4000mah ts lasts for a full day charging is super fast. Screen on time is more than 5hours\n4. Earphone and usb c to 3.5 mm jack is here\n5. Funtouch OS is fun to use. It has lot of feature and customise option\n6. Processor is good enough i can say its not in this segment you will get better processor in this price range but this has advantage of zero heating. Phone never gets heat.\n7. Camera is extremely good with lot of feature pro mode is nice raw is here but no wide angle support. night mode is good but not the best. Video quality is good 4k 60fps on main and 1080p on ultra wide. OIS works good on rear camera. Low light video could be better . Portrait Mode is excellent works good in low light too. Macro is sharp you just need perfect light\n8. Main focus on this phone is selfie. 1st time i am satisfied with the front camera in my 1st impression. Low light photos are better than S21 ultra. Portrait mode is amazing and video is sharp with 4k. Night mode is also here with lot of filters and effect.\n\nOnly thing to concern is processor else everything is excellent. Ultra Wide angle could be better and sound should be loud elese everything is fine.\n\nI must say its one of the best looking phone and it has best selfie capabilities. Loved it.",
            "Camera wise very great in day light condition. But in low light it's need improvement.\nLooks wise little bit of outdated in front side.\nBack is good for giving matte glass but side frame must be metal.\nDisplay is awesome in every lighting condition.\nBattery is ok for moderate usage.",

There is no comparable phone with Vivo v21 5G in Selfie. No high end phones also. Only one Telephoto and SD card could have fulfilled my wish. Build quality? Superb. Sound quality? Superb. Very loud.

            "Vivo v21 5 G Best selfie cemera on this segment Design\nAmazing\nI am very happy best looking mobile and best selfie cemera i loved it vivo v21 5 G mobile",
            "Loved it... It's a fantastic smartphone with very premium design. Thanks to VIVO for making a beautiful smartphone and thanks to FLIPKART for very fast delivery.\n*PROS - CAMERA, DESIGN, DISPLAY and BUILD QUALITY.\n*PROS - LIGHT WEIGHT and VERY SLIM & SLEEK DESIGN.\n*PROS - IN HAND FEEL is very GOOD, LOVED IT...\n\n*CONS - PROCESSOR ( \" DIMENSITY 800 U \" ) is used. But it should be higher than this\nmay be (DIMENSITY 1000 or 1200) should be better at this price range.\nBut never mind it performance is good but not so good for gamers. Beside this FUN TOUCH OS is very nicely optimised. I am very happy to see this performance.\n*CONS - BATTERY is 4000 mAh only. It should be little bit higher. But still E3 AMOLED display and the 7 nm processor are battery efficient. So the battery consumption is very low even in full brightness and heavy usage. Overall I loved it. Only i want is a good processor higer than 800 U will be good.\n\nNow if you are a selfie King \ud83d\udc51 or a Queen \ud83d\udc51 an want a Good Camera with a premium and light weight with slim and sleek design. go for it.\nThat's all.\nThank you",
            "I went on many reviews about the phone and ordered it and I am really happy about it. The phone as a real classy look and looks ultra cool with many features inside.. the fingerprint and face detection works really fast and there are many dynamic efforts which are pretty good. About the camera yes it's one of the best picture quality and front camera is also good with spotlight effects . But more features could have been included in the camera settings like short viedo, vlog mode or some other effects. The slow-motion mode is really bad with poor pic quality. Other than that it's a good handy phone.",
            "As expected vivo has made great 5 device which has all features.Super design & elite look,front camera dual spotlight flash very amazing,Good camera,good performance,good network speed than other smartphones.Battery is good.Mic is good But vivo need to improve speaker's sound quality for call & music..Over all 9 points out of 10. love it..",
            "You just have to live everything about this phone. The look, performance,build, display,software and everything. The camera is the best one i had ever seen in a phone which in my opinion is better than the latest iPhone as of now. There are only two things that I wish were different about this phone.\n1. The battery. 4000mah is not something you would expect to have in Phone of this range. It should have been a bit more like 4500mah.\n2. This is specific to vivo users only. The latest funtouch OS is very different from its previous versions. The shortcut center of the previous versions (mine was vivo v15) was such a great feature that came in handy. There\nused to be only notifications in the notification bar ,all the shortcuts used to be in the shortcut center which you had to drag from the feature. It was a cool feature and takes time to get used to the new one.\n\nThe notch (water drop design at the top) looks a bit weird for the people who used popup camera phones which has the true infinity display. You'll need some time to get used to it too. It's only been two weeks tho since the time I bought the phone. I'll use it for considerable amount of time and edit my review again.",
            "Nice experience with Vivo V21, camera \ud83d\udcf8 clear and focused very good, Battery \ud83d\udd0b about 25-30 minutes charging until full \ud83d\udcaf% and 1.5-2 day perfectly uses.\nPerformance like awesome",
            "It's a camera centric Phone, sufficient proccessor for daily task, well balanced in every aspect whether it's camera or day to day work , people who are use Phone for camera or any other day to day task can go for it",
            "1) Phone looks good\n2) weight is seems to be okay\n3 display okay\n4) Performance okay\n\n5) Camera features are good\n6) back camera okay, but image quality is not for the worth of 64mp\n7) front camera image okay, buts it is not quality of 44 mp camera, totaly disappointed on this.\n8 ) I am not sure what kind of fast charge they given, from 40 to 100% it tooks 2.5 hrs, for Just 60% of charge,\n9) overal not worth for money.\n10) I Just gone through all the reviews, where all are given 5 star and I had seen 2 star also, but by seeing 5 star reviews only I bought this phone, but now I am worrying to bought this phone.",
            "My review after one week of usage.Camera is too good specially the selfie camera which has flash.Battery is also too good and the weight of the phone is very light. Overall I am happy \ud83d\ude0a",
            "It is one of the best camera phone in the market till now at this price range. Average performance is quite good enough though I am not a gamer.",
            "Camera superb focusing superb\nBattery superb\nDisplay superb\nAll are superb\nBut one this they didn't give 3.5 Jack and they provide a hybrid SIM slot .\nIn this range many mobile give all features .",
            "Best cemera selfie phone in india\nI use almost 5 days I feel better experience from other phone\nAnd aslo thanx to flipkart to provide such a best phone\nBettety \ud83d\udcaf",
            "Product quality is not upto the mark\n1. Back camera is not good\n2. Front camera is not good it adds extra layer which makes pictures look like artificial also night mode camera pictures look weird.\n3. Performance wise it's also not good, since two day it hang twice.\n4. Only after using for 1 week, it's earphone has stopped working.",
            "Camera: Nice camera with ois \ud83d\udcf8 Night mode working good.\nDisplay: amoled\nBack build quality: glass\nIn hand feel: premium\nRAM: 8Gb & 3Gb expandable\nBattery: 4000 mah with 33W fast charging\ni think phone is decent but price is so high according to features..",
            "Previously I was using oppo F7 for 3+ years..\nI purchased this phone on exchange offer..\nOverall phone is good..\nBut while comparing to my old mobile oppo F7 , Display quality looks little bit low in Vivo V21..\nCamera quality looks like same as my old phone.\nNight mode works good in Vivo, front 2 led spot lights gives more clear picture..\nGood battery , fast charging..\nOverall it's good.",
            "After 2 weeks of my usage iam giving the review that this mobile performance is very good.\nIn this handset The more advantage is that chrging backup.If u charge for 50mins u can use it 24hrs without ant disturbance.\nComing camera it's awesome\nOverall I can recommend that this is best",

            "Wow simply superb 5G mobile in 2021 better than Samsung phones. Performance,Camera and battery is simply amazing ... researched a lot finally got a outstanding vivo V21.. many posted negative comments make me confuse but I ensure u lots of great features and lovely mobile of the segment., Go for it friends.. I am fully satisfied with this Mobile and value of money too.,",
            "Terrific Camera. Good performance. Good battery life. Happy to have bought this phone",
            "Writing reviews after using around 1 week.\n\nThis phone is best phone in V series segment upto date. Every thing is upto mark in this phone. The only thing which i don't like in this phone is hybrid sim card slot. Every thing works great in this piece. As the officials are saying about night selfie camera is really worth saying.\n\nNight selfie camera does outstanding job portraits are improved a lot specialy edge detection. Rear camera also does decent job.\n\nLets talk about performance, Vivo 21 5G does quite good job in terms of performance which feels quite smooth as compared to previous V-Series Phones due to 90Hz screen refresh rate.\n\nVivo V21 5G have battery capacity of 4000mah, which i feel little less in this price segment But i am really surprised as this phone provide good battery life, this is just because mediatek demensity 800U processor and vivo does good job in optimising funtouch OS, which drain less power in background process.\n\nOverall it is a good deal.",
            "Its a camera centric phone and camera is awesome .\nDesign is so beautiful .Very slim and handy to use .\nA very nice phone by vivo in this price range.only thing missing is battery it should be 5000mah .Charging is super fast.Guys camera is excellent .loved it thanks flipkart very prompt delivery .\nOne thing more flipkart packing is not good at all.",
            "Overall good choice. But as per the price segment processor is not up to the mark. Should be used SD 8 series processor. As ViVo known for good camera phone so again they did good job in this area.",
            "Amazing mobile best ever I bought...and great service thank I flipkart..",
            "Excellent Product from Vivo which is as expected. They are much better phones even better than Samsung . You can always rely on Vivo.\n\nSpeed performance is great. Camera is excellent . Gaming experience great and perfect value for money",
            "best selfie cam arround 30k thanks to 44mp ois.\nnight mode is very empressive.\nbut i'm heavy camera user it should have addtionally, portrait vedio/ bokeh vedio option for vedio recording as this device is very capapable if uts cameras it just need a update for portrait vedio option.\nback cam is also satisfactory\n\n4000amh battery is upto the mark battery runs 1 day upto normal usage heavy usage may need charge twice a day.\n\nchaging speed: the charging speed is good enough as it comes with 33watt chager .it takes approx 1 to 1h 10 min from 0 to 100.i would suggest turn on battert saver to prevent extra darinage anf for good vattery life.\n\ndesign is very premium.feels handy and very slim light waighted .belive me you could forget that you are carriyng a phone in your hand or pocket while you are busy or talking.\n\nAll over it will empress your friend circle specially front camera and design. picture taken from the device and etiting it from lightroom gives mind blowing result with great details.",
            "Phone performance is very good .\nCamera is superb but I am thinking may be after a system update there may be a change come .let's see.\nBcz it's 44mp OIS so it's not so impressive as I thought so .\nBattery \ud83d\udd0b is -5 Star .\nDisplay -5 star\nLight weight phone that's a good thing.\nRest it's 4 star phone .",
            "Its nice Phone\n1st time purchase the Vivo model phone\nAm very impressed in all those Camera, Memory, Apps, Phone performance.\nAm review in Flipkart app and other Websites after I purchased Vivo V21\n1st am choose Vivo V20 pro at that time Vivo V21 launched am impress in model, Phone spec.,\nSo am very happy to purchase Vivo V21 in Flipkart am awesome delivery and very good process in EMI options\nEvery thing am purchase in Flipkart in every time at any time",
            "Simply Superb, One of Best Mobiles. Value for Money.\n\nAfter Using, Great with Battery, whole day usage still Battery charge about 50%\n\nMore faster charging, time saving. Ultimate Camera both Front and Rear sides.",
            "I bought it considering it to be great camera phone, but it turned out to be a disappointment.\n\nBody - It felt good, but side frame is plastic which indeed feels cheap. An Aluminum frame could have done much better.\n\nDisplay - Its really, which is expected from a AMOLED panel. But the fingerprint scanner is slow, which is also expected from an indisplay scanner.\n\nCamera - Not satisfied. My primary requirement is camera and I am disappointed from its performance. Photos are not coming out to be natural, they are being digitally enhanced. When we zoom in, you won't see much details. Front camera with OIS does not justify its hype. EIS in many phones is better than V21's OIS.\n\nProcessing - Performance is also not worth the money and the reason might be the processon. Snapdragon is way better than its competition. RAM management is good though.\n\nBattery - It is decent and the charging is also very fast.",
            "1.Slimmest, Lightest and beautiful phone.\n2.Both Camera and overall design awesome.\n3.Battery for me does its purpose for full day as I m not a gamer, no heating, fast charge awesome.\n4.Sound is good, if anyone have problem with sound so it's a phone not a woofer, mind it.\n5.Processor does its job very well.\n6. Funtouch OS is smooth and user friendly.\n7. Archtic white is best colour as compare to others.\n\n\nOverall I am satisfied with every aspect of phone.\nMy only issue is cost of phone which is slightly high..\n\nThat's it from my side.. go for this phone u all are not going to regret.. thnku..",

            "Camera is good. But not as per expectation.. Especially considering this as camera centric phone.\nWide angle lens does the job but quality could have been better\nMacro lens is of no use.\nPrimary lens is good but behaves abnormally when it sees human face. It adjusts the picture which you won't probably like.\nSelfie camera is very good and does the job efficiently.\n\nOperating system:\nThe look of os is very bad\nIt is user friendly..as such no issues are there in using but you expect the colour combination/overall looks of what you're operating to be better. I'm sure you'll find it a bit disappointing.\nDisplay is very good.\nYou'll find the screen colour to be yellowish. However, you can adjust the white temperature but at the lowest point also you'll feel little yellowish colour. This is as per personal taste but I felt this yellowish colour not satisfying.\n\nAlmost all the available themes are payable. So if you're theme lover who wants to change looks by frequently changing themes, you'll find it annoying.\n\nOthers:\nPhone is very fast, connectivity is very good. Fingerprint sensor does the job fast if not very fast like Mi back sensor. Face detection is really good.\n\nSpeaker: very disappointing at this price point. How can you provide single speaker. Come on..\n\nThis product comes with wired earphone who's sound is good. Comfort level is not ok at least with me. It hurts however I don't use it as I have other option.\n\nOverall if you are spending above 30K you can have better phone in this market.",

Dont believe me, try turning ultra stable on off, you will see that the camera zooms in when ultra stable is on which means it crops the image or video to make it seems that it's stable now. This is not OIS rather EIS which is present in cheap phones.\n\nExtended ram is a scam because if you use part of your rom as ram then basically it will slow down your phone as ram is much much faster then rom.\n\nProcessor is also underpowered for the price point.",
