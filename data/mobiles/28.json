            "I'll give a detailed review after using the phone for a week.\n\nPros :-\n1. Big 6000mAh battery\n2. Ad and bloatware free near-stock Android OS with the latest update\n3. Customisable user friendly UI\n4. Nice clear camera (I'm not a camera person but I liked both the front and rear cameras and the options which we have in the camera app)\n\nCons :-\n1. For those who haven't used big screens like me, getting used to this screen will take a while.\n2. Moto promised an upgrade till Android 12 but they didn't comment about anything after that. They need to be clear about that like other brands like Samsung, Nokia, etc.)\n\nDidn't find any other cons after that.\nAfter all this, I think it's a good phone.",
            "Performs admirebly well in most scenarios, thanks to the clean UI. The real-world performance is impressive and sails out with ease in day-to-day tasks as well as gaming.\n\nCamera is good in daylight scenarios but lags behind in low light.\n\nEverything else is impressive, be it network reception, call quality, outdoor visiblity, battery performance or speaker output.\n\nI wish the phone was a compact one.",
            "You will fall in love with how the phone works literally !!\nPerformance is butter smooth, internet is blazing fast, downloads and installs are pretty quick.\nCamera is good you'll just need to get used to clicking pictures with moto because it requires some practice.\nA lil bit heavy but you'll get used to it in a day and after all it is power packed so you won't mind it much.\nDefinitely go for it, it's a perfect phone with clean UI.\nLots of Love to Moto for this !!",
            "In one word it's worth buying this phone ... battery is good and charger is also turbo so it takes 1hr to 1.5hr to fully charged .and last but not the least camera quality is super .......",
            "Very big screen and little bulky. But very good mobile.\nAny how we make it bulky by putting a fancy case. But screen is so big and it might need 2 hands.\n\nWhatever, stock Android, awesome price range, good features. Definitely value for money.\n\nOrdered 2 more after seeing first one.",
            "From a student point of view,(after 1week of use)\n\nIt was really great from.batyery as a full charge last almost 26-28hrs (with useage). Display is good. Buy can't say anything about gaming. And as i am a moto user previously also its easy to manuever this device. Really liked the notification feature of Android 11. But there no option to reduce screen size to one hand mode as it was available for new moto g series. And there is no option to customise Assistant button.\n\nOverall its a great purchase. Hope screen guard and good cover will come soon.",
            "Motorola is very awesome phone. As well as I'm using Motorola since 2013 it is launching very good phones .it has very good camera and crazy' performance and many more",
            "Adding this comment after 4 days of heavy use\nFirst thing to mention is the battery backup. Lasted for 3 days without gaming.\n\nCamera is good enough and is stable. If you're looking for a better camera, go for G60, has the same specs but 108mp camera. Rest is the same\n\nSpeakers are working nice at high volumes and have a good pitch to it.\n\nUi is stock android 11 with latest updates installed. It is pretty smooth and free of bloatware which is not the case with poco and mi phones. But if you're from the background of any of the above 2, (like I am), you'll find some useful features absent here,, like floating window, blurring aap in task manager preview mode and others fancy things. But life can go on without these hassle-free anyways.\n\nPhone is little bulky when compared to others but that shouldn't be concerning as we always use heavy back covers. Screen is very big, so if you're looking for a big screen (people with big hands will find this phone appealing) go for it.\nScreen refresh rate is 120heartz, which is unusual at this price range. Really feels smooth and fluid.\n\nOnly con is that the battery capacity is 6000mah and to charge a massive battery like this, motorola should have provided atleast a 33 watt charger instead of 20watt.\nAnd yes, a notification light would have been a nice add-on :)\n\nOverall: low budget, maximum battery, good performance and a big screen with smooth stock ui. I guess that's all you need for day to day work.",
            "Previously i used moto phone for 2 and half years (Moto one power) which is still working superb,, recently i changed the battery and all good,,\nThat's why i am choosing moto again,\nMoto g40 fusion 6/128 (Frosted champagne)\nI am using this device from 6th Oct 2021\n\nHere i am talking about some points, that u should Consider\n\n1. IN HAND FILL:- This phone is tall slightly heavy and bulky too, if you use cover with it. But after sometime u will get used to it, not a big deal.\n\n2. CAMERA:- Daylight photo or in naturel lighting condition it is good but in night or low light performance not good,,\n\n3. AUDIO:- when i was searching review about this phone i try to find some audio review about loudspeaker and headphone but nobody talk about it,, my previous moto device loudspeaker quality is good but headphone jack quality not very impressive,\nThis device has a mono speaker and its good but not very impressive, my previous moto device has better loudspeaker comparing to this\nHeadphone jack output is good if u adjust equalizer and use good quality headphones.\nIn calls earpiece is ok and loud enough\n\n4. They giving security patch update in quarterly\nPatch is still on July 1, 2021\n\nSome points what i likes\n1. Moto gesture\n\n2. Performance 732G great,, easily handle heavy task no lag no heating problem\n\n3. Awesome battery \ud83d\udd0b easily give u 10 hours of screen on time\n\n4. Charging speed is ok with 20w charging,, 2 hours plus to 100% but its ok because of optimize night charging feature is there to charge the phone overnight, it will protect your battery\n\n5. Screen is big and good, viewing angle is also good. For multimedia consumption its perfect. Outdoor visibility is ok\n\n6. 120 hz display is smooth. Once u used it u can clearly see the difference between 120hz and 60hz\n\n7. It has Carriar aggregation (4g+) i got 4g+ in jio in my area (Airtel not provide 4g+ in my area)\n\n8. Fingerprint print sensor is fast and reliable\n\n9. Awesome Ram management\n\n10. Vibration motor is slightly good,, its not like old one. When you type it feels smooth and premium\n\n11. No bloatware, no bugs, no unwanted notifications. Simple UI close to stock android\n\nTips:-\nIf u need good performance (for games) and good ram management then go for 6/ 128 and if u need higher camera and NFC go for G60\n\nGo for Frosted Champagne colour it has matt finish back. Fingerprint or smudges are not easily attract comparing to Dynamic gray.\nDynamic gray color verient has glossy finish its attract smudge easily.",

            "The phone is exactly as I expected. No disappointment at all. I would recommend buying the G40 Fusion instead of G60 because the camera is almost the same. I exchanged my G6 for this and got a great price. Charging is a bit slow. I usually charge it at night so I don't feel the charging rate. After a week of usage my review is\nPros:\n1. Camera is good in daylight.\n2. Sound system is good and offers audio styling as well.\n3. Build quality is nice.\n4. Clean UI is its best feature. No \"un-deletable\" bloatware.\n120Hz refresh rate works like a treat.\nPhone feels premium to hold.\n5. 6000mAh battery lasts more than 2 days on decent usage\n\nCons:\n1. Might heat up a little when using while charging.\n2. The Google assistant button is a waste. (Why press a button when you can activate the assistant by just saying \"Hey Google\"?)\n3. Even though the back looks amazing, without the cover, it's a bit of a fingerprint magnet.\n\nNote: weight of the phone is not very noticeable. The first time you hold the phone it might seem heavy, but you get used to it within hours",
            "Phone has many pros and cons, pros include good display, terrific battery life, good gaming experience and an absolute treat to use stock android. Cons include camera it could have been a bit better at this price range there are better camer phones than the phone is a bit bulgy but if you look at the pros than it's fine to trade off with this con. Overall a good product at this price range. Must buy if you are looking for mid range non chinese mobile phone with a secure stock android OS unlike the chinese UI which offer less security and more data breach.",
            "This is very good phone with sd 732g at this price. It camera is very good. Battery very good. Display very big. And clear picture quality. And clean and clear UI system with android one. I love this phone. My first moto g40 fusion is very fast. Love to play battle grounds mobile india and this phone handle very smoothly all the game purpose. Very premium look.",
            "Anyone who is hesitating bcz of the weight beleive me I also have the tension about the weight but when I unboxed and took it in my hand I was totally surprised (also to be mentioned that I'm moving from a 5 inches phone) , it is lighter and handy than I expected.\nOs is fantastic bcz I'm moving from miui . Though there is not a lot features like miui but every essential day to day usage features are there I'm not facing any kind of problem .The experience with the os on 120hz screen is so buttery smooth .\nPerformance is also nice. No overheating\nCamera I would say in the price range it captures decent photos even with the wide angle camera\nThe haptics on the keyboard is very good.\nMy favourite and most useful feature is peek display it's almost like an always on display.\nAt the end I would say if anyone like me want to move on from Miui then definitely go for this you wouldn't regret it",
            "Hi guys, yesterday only I have received the product from Flipkart, ans it\u2019s a big surprise for me that opening of the box I found the phone totally handy while in many reviews on YouTube it was informers that\u2019s it\u2019s so heavy and very thick but it\u2019s not at all like that. Yes due to the 6.78\u201d screen and 6000 mah battery it\u2019s big but not that bulky.\nI love the display of this phone as it\u2019s so smooth to use and the stock android experience is always amazed.\nCamera of the phone is also good in performance.\nSometime I feels very minor lags otherwise it\u2019s working awesome.\nIn this price range u can\u2019t buy any other device like this for sure. So just go for it.",

I remember back in 2017 motorola was making good build quality phones like g5s & all, but I don\u2019t know what happened to motorola they are now making cheap build quality phones that can easily break & that display can easily crack.

It has better connectivity both for phone calls and internet.\nConnected really quickly to my Car Bluetooth as well. Since I moved from the Moto Z Play to this phone, this was a super upgrade in terms of speed and memory space.\n\nThe data migration / transfer was smooth between both these phones except for the fact that I am still facing issues restoring my WhatsApp back-up. No idea what the problem is.\nThe battery has been holding steady when used for work related video/voice calls and there has been no indication of heating at all.\nLove the camera and looking forward to use the features (there's a lots of it as compared to my Moto Z Play, so pretty much hyped about it)\n\nNo cons accept for the back-up restore issue that I have, but its not really a phone problem.\nWould recommend this product at the price.",

Good camera experience good outputs but disappointed in night shots and processing time.it takes 4 or 5 seconds to get process a photo i think they fix with a future update.\nApart from display LCD is good enough but other brands give amoled at same price moto giving LCD panel.another thing I noticed is the brightness of display.Brightness is low when in sunlight we set it to full at that point...\nWhile came to the speaker's quality it's above average\n\nTotally a good phone with some cons...I tell you what no phone is perfect,every phone has its pros and cons...",

Moto g40 fusion is little bit heavy, but trust me guys...you don't have to face any trouble regarding bloatware compared other Chinese co. phone. I really trust moto as my first phone( not android ) was also from this brand and I used that for 7 long years.\n\nPros:\n1) stock android...so security from Google.\n2) battery pack up...6000 mAh... enough for regular use. ( I played pubg and other games also)\n3) extra protection comes with inbuilt think sheild.\n\nCons:\n1) A little bit heavy compared other same configuration phone.\n2) default ringtone and other software are useless.\n3) sim tray support either one sim+ memory card or sim+ sim....",

Rarely you would get all this amazing feature combo at this price point.\n\nOnly drawback is lack of NFC, but it's not a deal breaker at all.\n\nDefinitely go for this. This phone will also last long as it's durable both hardware and software wise... In love with the phone.",
            "This mobile is best for gaming because of its powerful snapdragon 732G processer. and its battery is unstoppable. and the main highlight is 64 superb cameras.",
            "THE best at the price of 14k.\nUsing this for some weeks now. Device looks classy and clean inside and out.\nIn short, it is recommended for people who need clean UI, enjoys watching videos, and wants to keep device for more than 3 years.\n\nGoing into details:\nFirst nd most obvious thing is it's size. It's MASSIVE in size. Definitely not recommend fr short hands. However, it's 6.8 inch IPS DISPLAY is just great fr media consumption nd sound output is also decent.\n\nMoving on to BATTERY, it's surprisingly great. I am easily getting 2 to 3 days in single charge with around 12hrs of screen on time. ( I don't play any games, I only use fr media consumption nd calls). Charging time is around 2hrs.\n\nNetwork reception is also good . at this price ( got it fr 14k) it gets 4G+ aggregation for stable nd high speed 4g net.\n\nCAMERA is giving great results. Specially in day light it easily competes with my OnePlus Nord. It's ultrawide angle camera can also take macro photos witch are best at this price point. Selfie is decent as well. Although, night shot are not that great.\n\nPERFORMANCE with snapdragon chipset nd stock android combination with 120Hdz display is buttery smooth with no noticable lags. It can handle all daily tasks easily and I haven't noticed any heating. I am not a gamer. But it can handle games good as well.\n\nOn this flip side,\nOne major DRAWBACK is it's weight and length. It is so heavy and large. Although u get habituated to it, U cant hold it for long time to watch movies while sleeping.\n\nPLEASE ENSURE WORKING OF ALL SENSORS AND CAMERAS AFTER PRODUCT DELIVERY:\nAt first I have received a device with a defect, it's ultrawide angle camera is not working and it's showing an error in camera app. But thankfully I requested fr replace nd Flipkart have replaced it. Now on this device it's working properly.",
            "Reviewing after using one week.\n\nCamera: Stock camera is good, but I recommend to use gcam. You get dedicated front flash light for selfie which is awesome (this feature is available only on stock camera, not on gcam).\n\nBattery: When you use 120hz refresh rate, it drains faster as compared to 60hz. Battery backup is good, I am mid heavy user, I got battery backup for around 9hrs, for avg user and normal user phone will obviously give you 1 day battery backup!!\n\nPerformance: SD 732g performs very well. I didn't notice any lag and hang as of now!!! ( I have 6gb RAM and 128gb ROM variant)\n\nNetwork : It supports career aggregation which is awesome!! The call quality is good.\n\nDisplay: 120hz is awesome!!\n\nWeight: Motorola has done well job in weight distribution. You might see it's 225gm but believe me it doesn't feel that much!!\n\nSound: Sound quality is also good.\n\nOverall phone is awesome!! Go for it",

Camera appli also good catch photo. Performance very smooth 120hz wow truly fantastic. No extra boat ware app\npersonaly i used whole day 8 hour mobile for game and video some call and still 30% battery remaining. Battery charging techniq best\nPro. Who love crystel clear smooth experience so this mobile definately for you.\nCon. IR blaster not available in moto device. Camera little bit increase quality.otherwuse ok",
            "After 10 Days of extensive uses-\n\nPros-\nI didn't experienced any regarding battery. It will easily run for 2 days when charged 100%. Even if you play heavy games in high settings it won't lag. Display is good, processor is good, Radio is average, Camera is nice. It heats after turbo charge and heavy gameplay but not much..\nOptimisation, customisation features are just awesome.\nBest for those who spend more time on smartphones.\nThey provide back cover but that doesn't protect camera glass.\nData Speed is fantastic. It's superfast.\n\n\nCons-\nOrder Camera lens protecting back cover and Tempered Glass too.. Just like service center, Accessories are also only available through online process. Screen is very big. Weight is lil bit more. I have used Redmi 5A earlier and the thickness, weight, size of that smartphone was perfect.",
            "Bought this phone after I watched the durability test of this phone performed by Youtuber - Gupta Information Systems.\nThere are other brand phones which are cheaper than this and with better specs. But I chose Moto over them as Moto phones are more durable and the specs of this phone is not bad at all for this price.\nMy suggestion - Go with G40 6gb version instead of G60 as you won't find much of a difference between the photos taken by both the phones.",
            "Writing this review after 5 days of usage.\n\nShort Review: If your main priorities are stock android, a good processor and a decent camera, go for it.\n\nPros:\n1. Big display and near AMOLED-like colours. Previously I was using a IPS LCD screen itself so I was okay with IPS LCD. Nevertheless the quality of the screen is superb.\n2. Battery - according to my usage (online meetings, music, COD mobile for 30 minutes) it lasted about 1 and a half day. With light usage it will easily give more than 2 days of battery life and charging speed is quite good. Slow charging is safe too :)\n3. Weight distribution - If you're hesitating because of its size and weight, don't worry. The weight distribution is superb and within a few days you'll get used to it and other phones will feel light. It also fits easily in any jeans pocket.\n4. Stock Android - Awesome experience. Only Google apps were there and some Motorola customization apps which don't take up much space. So you're getting 112GB of free space out of the box (For the 128GB variant). And of course, no ads, junk or bloatware.\n5. Durability - This phone is built like a tank! Very strong and sturdy.\n6. Security - As you may know this comes with ThinkShield Mobile 4-layered hardware and software security so the phone is quite safe compared to chinese phones. Yes, Motorola is owned by Lenovo (which is chinese) but our data is stored in Motorola's U.S servers. So in security, this is a very good phone.\n7. Plastic back is of premium quality and I took the Frosted Champagne colour and this one even resists fingerprints!\n\nCons:\n1. Camera night shots could be improved a bit. Daylight shots are beautiful considering the price point and macro is just mind-blowing. Only night shots are a bit dull and can be improved.\n2. Hybrid SIM slot - this is not a con for me as I use a single SIM but for people who use two SIM cards and a microSD card, this is a problem.\n3. Misses stereo speakers although the mono-speaker is quite loud and clear.\n4. People with small hands will find it difficult using this phone. People with average sized palms won't have much problem but you cannot use it one-handed.\n5. You might have problem seeing the display outdoors with strong sunlight. You need to find shade and then check your phone.\n6. People who want just AMOLED screen only, then this is not a good choice for them.\n\nOverall this is a good value-for-money phone. If your budget is below or around the 15k price mark, then do consider this.",
            "Writing after 15 days of purchasing.\n1.Well the camera is average not worth the hype, please use G-CAM for better results.\n2. Phone isn't too heavy it is comfortable but the screen size is large so folks with smol hands won't be able to use it comfortably.\n3. Performance wise quite good, didn't face any lags or stuttering while playing games or normal use.\n4. Charging ain't a issue because the battery stays for a long time so you can charge it while you're sleeping and it'll last the day easily with moderate use.\n5. I moved from my primary Redmi Note 4 so it was quite annoying for me in the beginning because the stock android doesn't have many basic features like notepads or app lock but yeah it is acceptable.\n6. Calling and chatting experience is quite good.\n7. Bluetooth connectivity is strong.\n8. Wi-Fi/Data seems more speedy.\n9. Over-all about the phone,\nYou can buy it if you're looking for a budget gaming phone or a phone for normal usage it'll do, but don't expect too much from the camera.\n\nThats all, will update if i get any future updates.",

            "1. Processor is awesome, giving smooth performance even when 8-10 apps are open simultaneously\n2. RAM being 6 GB does it's magic\n3. OS is bloatware free, near-stock android, so could remove all default apps & keep only those which I want, giving me the power of full customization which is the best thing about Motorola smartphones\n4. Battery backup being 6000 mAh is one of the features to kill for & can go 2 days without charge\n5. Fast charging is also there taking about 1.5-2 hours at max for full charge from 15%\n6. Needless to say camera quality is mind-blowing\n\nFound no cons yet & hope not to find one in future.\nJust a thought, why near-stock android & not full-stock android cause Motorola used to be one of those brands to give full-stock android, then why not anymore?\nI'd still be waiting for a full-stock android from Motorola even though near-stock android does it's job pretty well.",

But there is a 6000mah battery inside and what can we expect. It seems heavy for the first 2 days incase you earlier used a very light phone.But otherwise there is no issues with the weight.I would recommend you to go for the 6-128gb variant.And don't forget to buy a tempered glass along with the phone.",
            "It has really a nice design,\nI'm really satisfied with this phone, I recommend G-cam\nThe main con in this phone is image processing time\nAfterall this value for money \ud83d\udcb0",
            "It's a value for money phone. Haven't checked the camera (it's also not my priority).\nMy priorities are 3 things :\n1) Performance : Performance is adequate and upto the mark wrt to the price. Stock android also helps in giving a better user experience. It's not blazing fast, but good for day to day use.\n\n2) Battery : Battery is good. Easily can run along the whole day with heavy usage. For moderate users, it will be good for 2 days. Charging is slow and will take 2-2.5 hrs to charge from 10-100.\n\n3) Speaker : Even though it's a single speaker, it's loud and clear.\n\n4) Call quality : Call quality has been good and didn't face any issues.\n\n5) Screen : Screen quality is good. It's a decent LCD panel. Haven't seen any specific diff in the refresh rate, may be because I am not using the phone very rigorously.\n\nOverall : I think it's a good vfm phone. In this range it's better than Redmi/Realme options. Don't fall for 5g or Amoled screen gimmicks. Amoled panels at this price range are not great in quality and users are facing diff issues w.r.t to touch and quality.\nThough the phone is a bit bigger in hand compared to others, but it's relatively narrow and easier to hold. Stock android experience is always an added advantage with Moto phones.",

            "This is one of the best phones to get at this price range.\n\nPerformance:\nAt this price, I would say this is one of the best performance phones you would get on the market as Motorola provides stock android so that it doesn\u2019t has any bloatware or any unwanted background running processes. This phone uses a Snapdragon 732G which is one of the best 4g processors under 20k so overall performance is smooth and it can also provide above average gaming performance.\n\nDisplay:\nThis phone has a 120hz IPS LCD display with HDR10 support. IPS LCD is one of the few cons I see in this phone as some other phones in the same price range provide AMOLED but the video and gaming experience would not affect that much as there is 120hz refresh rate and HDR10 support.\n\nCamera:\nThe 64MP main sensor produces great quality images but the wide angle and macro produces average images. The wide angle quality can be solved by using a GCAM port. Also it does support video recording up to 4k@30 fps which is pretty good.\n[Few camera samples are attached (some images went through basic post processing)]\n\nBattery:\nThis has a 6000mAh battery which lasts almost 1 and half days with average usage. As this is a stock android phone, battery life is higher compared to other 6000mah phones.\n\nDesign:\nThis phone weighs around 210 grams which is slightly heavier compared to other phones with a similar price tag but you won\u2019t feel it as a heavy phone in hand as it has good weight distribution. It is 9.6 mm thick which is more comparatively and it becomes thicker when it comes with a case.\n\nPros:\n1) 120hz with HDR10 Display\n2) Stock Android Experience\n3) Good 64MP Main Camera.\n4) Good processor for the price.\n\nCons:\n1) Bit heavy & thick\n2) LCD Panel (Not AMOLED)\n3) 4g Phone (No 5g support)",

            "Its been few weeks, post purchase of this power-packed device. 6000 mAh is no joke at this price point and this comes handy for an avid gamer like me. Other features including 16MP camera are smooth going so far. Not a regular photographer, so no comments on technical aspects of photo quality but for a normal user like me, its not an issue. However, I feel that since we do not have buttons at the bottom to navigate to the previous screen of an app, gesture controls integrated with any app for navigation would have been an added USP for this device. Other improvement could be in hardware to lighten its weight. I do have a point for FlipKart to provide the correct exchange value of phone. A small scratch (size of a Bindi) on a screen resulted in in deduction of Rupees 2200 which was against the exchange rules. The brand exchanged was a well-known fighting brand still trying to prove its existence like a wounded lion where I believe is still a leader in its space of hardware design. But for Moto G40 Fusion - its a thumbs up!",

            "Sorry for bad English, I am writing this so that everyone can understand.\nI purchased this phone and it was delivered on 31st July. I have been using this for 10 days. I recorded lot of videos. Shot lot of pictures and did gaming as well. With call speaker everything. Let me tell you everything\nThe camera - The camera is good but the pre installed camera software could not produce better results, so I used gcam app. It was really amazing and produced good results. Absolutely raw quality. For people who love original colour. This phone is a go to.\n\nThe battery is nice as well and works for me well. If you game a lot charging once is enough other 1.5 days backup will be served by this device\n\n\nGaming - BGMI works with great graphics and no lag\nCODM works on very high settings and very high frame rate or high graphics and max frame rate well. I think this is enough to give you an idea that the phone is good for gaming.\n\n\nVideo - front camera is good with 1080p recording and back camera can record 1080 60fps video or 4k 30 fps video. Works well.\n\nOther features - Good call quality, no wifi lag, 120hz is an amazing experience and it's not heavy being a large phone.\n\nDisplay - I have my wifi so I watch videos at 4k quality if they video has that much resolution. And it works extremely fine. I am a book reader as well and this phone serves right. So if anyone is look forward for this phone for study purpose it works well.",
            "I ordered if for my younger sister. She was using an MI phone previously, as per her review :\n\nIt's the best in this price segment with no pre-installed apps and bloatware.\n\nNo layered OS. It's stock Android.\n\nSuperb experience of using a stock Android. My sister is loving it.\n\nJust go for it, If you want a soothing stock Android experience.\n\nButton feels premium unlike on Redmi ones.\n\nIn hand, it feels like it will last longer than a Redmi one.",
            "This model am using for the past three weeks is for me by far the best value for money model I have ever bought... Considering the fact that this is the 1st time ever that I bought a high-costing electronic gadget online, am extremely satisfied with the setvice Flipkart has provided me. The humility of the delivery guy and the patience with which he opened the box and showed me if I have got what I have ordered was indeed praiseworthy.\nNow, as for the qualities of the phone... 1stly, Camera-- Very very good and satisfying images, videos r top quality as well. Though the battery is 6000mAh, slight overuse and non-usage of earphones drains the battery quickly. No lags in performance so far. The screen resolution is a-class... The only thing that I found lacking was the absence of a separate phone gallery where the photos and videos are all stored in one place. However, I have come to terms with the files by google by now. All over, it's a fantastic phone am using right now and thanks flipkart for the amazing offers on electronic appliances. \u263a\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude07",
            "Had it for one day now. Size of this thing is massive. Will be really hard to maneuver on it for people with small hands. Weight is relatively on the heavier side but you will get used to it really quick. Camera is not that great. After image processing is basically what you get at this price range. Battery is massive and battery life on this thing is amazing. At the time of writing this review been using it for 8 hours after a full charge and it's still got 68% battery left! Carrier aggregation is very impressive. Constantly getting LTE+. Voice on calls is also crystal clear. Haptics of this device don't belong to this price range, feel rather expensive. Fingerprint scanner is good enough. Got big hands so no issues with its placement. Software wise this device is an absolute delight! No bloatware at all. This was the main reason for me going for this purchase. Even though I come from a Samsung flagship (Galaxy S8: that phone was the Aphrodite of mobile devices) I would still say that overall this is a very nice phone. You're getting what you're paying for and more.",
            "Things I liked in this phone (big thumbs up) - Stock android - big thumbs up to software, no bloat and ad-wares. Phone's weight balance and build quality, Think Shield security, 120 hz refresh rate. Two days battery backup and provision of headphone jack, custom moto gestures and screen size. Proximity sensor.\n\nThings that are missing (thumbs down)-  Phone doesn't come with magnetometer (at least they must include this sensor in future models), No carrier aggregation (I did not find it on my device, maybe this can be unlocked with software upgrade) and NFC. 25 or 30 watt fast charging. Noise cancellation microphone.\n\nThings which need improvement - Ergonomic placement of finger print scanner, due to phone size, front camera punch hole and bezels size also would have been smaller. Hybrid sim slot to triple card slot. Improvement in camera image processing. Didn't like the phone speaker and needs big improvement. Can't play HDR10 videos. Increase in screen brightness for outdoors.",
            "Approx 1 month use moto g 40 fusion. I'm giving review all the information about phone is good and excellent performance.\n\nNote- I recommend only big fingers person buy it",
            "I got this after my JEE results. I do not game, so gaming performance was far from being a deal breaker for me. I wanted a decent camera and good display. This device checks both the boxes. The camera is really clear and the 120Hz display is addictive. Trust me, after using this phone, it's tough to go back to devices with a 60 Hz refresh rate. The processor is an added advantage. Doesn't lag one bit.\nAt this price, nothing comes close.",
            "This is a PHENOMENAL phone!\nPros:\n\n120Hz refresh rate (very smooth experience)\n\nVery good processor (you can play bgmi in high settings max frame rate but I play balenced because at high graphics it stutters a little)\n\nCLEAN stock android experience (better ram management)\n\nBIG DISPLAY! It looks almost like a mini tv.\n\nHUMONGOUS battery 6000 maH.\n\nNO ADS / BLOATWARE\n\nCons:\n\nEven though it is 6000 maH battery, it can drain pretty fast in 120Hz.\n\nThere are some glitches in the gestures like flip for DND. Sometimes it doesn't work at all and you have to restart your phone to make it work.\n\nGaming is good but super high graphics it stutters a little so I play balenced graphics.\n\nCamera could have been better!\n\nConclusion: pros outweigh the cons greatly.\nIf you want a fast phone with big battery and stock android experience, and great value for money, buy it",
            "A value for money smartphone by Motorola, Decent camera, Good display, Good performance in day to day activities, a tad bit on the bigger size ( won't recommend if you have small hands )",
            "This is my second moto phone.. writing this detailed review after a week's usage. New details are covered here for your better understanding.\nCurrently, I'm Using Realme 3 Pro(4GB+64GB) which was bought 2 years back. Realme 3 Pro is good in features but somewhat I'm not satisfied with that phone. MI Mobiles were also on the List but heard a lot of display issues, hanging, bloatware, and inferior quality. So Finally I decided to go with this Moto G40.\nMoto G40 pros:-\n1) Screen size is a little bigger which is good but not needed for everyone\n2) Screen quality is the same as Realme 3 Pro, no worries about the quality\n3) Clean OS, interesting moto gestures\n4) Lot of optimization than Realme 3 Pro (even both phones are having android 11)\n5) Call quality is great, signal strength is good, VOLTE calls are good\n6) Bluetooth & wi-fi connectivity is also good\n7) Interestingly the weight seems lesser than Realme 3 Pro (tried 2 phones in different hands, moto feels lighter than Realme 3 Pro)\n8) Phone thickness is of both moto & Realme is same, so no more bulky feel\n9) Camera quality is awesome when comparing with Realme 3 Pro. Many people are saying the camera is normal in reviews. those people may have not changed the settings. I tried to take pictures simultaneously in Realme 3 Pro & moto G40, Realme captured fewer details and moto g40 captured details than realme. color is natural in moto, Realme 3 Pro is oversaturated. Moto g40 is the clear winner than realme7.\n10) Battery life is like Realme 3 Pro, not seen any difference. withstanding for 1 full day without games. you can optimize the battery, fine-tune app usage details, change refresh rates to extend the battery life\n11) 6gb+128GB of moto is charm than 8gb+128GB of realme\n12) Build quality is good & sturdy.\n13) Sound quality is decent. no complaint.\n14) No heat\nGeneral:-\n1) Tried to charge with 30watts Dart charger of Realme 3 Pro, but moto phone charged like normal and turbocharger mode is not enabled\n2) Turbo mode enabled after connected the supplied moto charger. so there is NO support of other branded fast charger\n3) I liked the backside finger sensor option (my previous honor 8 pros is also having a back fingerprint sensor). Side finger sensor is not convenient in Realme 3 Pro, screen unlocking frequently while holding the mobile in hand. so, I'm okay with a back sensor.\nCons:-\n1) They supplied a transparent case is having sharp outer edges and is irritating while attending calls\n2) Seller delayed the shipment and Flipkart delivery was pathetic this time. Anyhow this is not related to the product\n3) 30watts / 60 watts fast charger is preferable at this price\nnot found any other issue.\nConclusion:-\nThis is better than Realme 3 Pro, Redmi Note 10 Pro, and other similar models. Trusted brand, super build quality, nice battery, and good weight balance. The camera quality is also very good at this price. You can go ahead with this model without any hesitation.",
            "VFM\nGaming processor, fast responsive and smooth clean stock Android experience.\n\nGood for day to day usage, battery makes it hard to handle this device it weighs around 225gm, IPS LCD Display comes with 20 watt charger which charge the device efficiently",
            "Review after one day of continuous use. Great product. The phone is a little heavy. I don't really care for the camera. I wanted a clean android experience after using the MI interface for three years. Very happy with the phone.",
            "Upgraded from Moto g4 plus. Great device. Don't fall for the negative comments here. It's a performance beast. Great battery life. If you're not getting good battery out of it then you just wait for few days to get your battery optimised to your usage pattern. Good camera. Performs well in daylight. Not that good indoors.\nOverall a good phone with great software experience.\nOnly one downside I would say is that it's big and sometimes hard to use with one hand.",
            "Okay so, I got this phone yesterday and I have been using this for a while now and the first impressions that I got were that this is a huge device. Now, by huge I mean to say that the display size and width of the device is a bit large, but weight of the phone as told by many reviewers, it's not that much, even if it is, still you won't feel like holding a heavy device. If you compare it with some average mobile phone(Redmi 5, my previous phone) it is heavy but not to the extent that you can't use it, usage is difficult in matters of screen. Also having a back fingerprint seems odd nowadays.\nTalking about the processor and the phone's performance now, it is good. Here I should mention that I haven't played any heavy games on this phone, and neither do I intend to but it will handle them efficiently, because using several apps at once, I didn't find any lags, hanging issues or heating problems as such. For a general user who consumes some multimedia and does some day to day work on his phone, this device shall not give any problems.\nBattery has performed a bit odd, it's draining rather more than it should, but maybe it's due to the fact that I have locked the screen at 120Hz and this is a big phone.\nBasic features like calling are good, no problems with the proximity sensor or any other thing, I have heard that there is no compass, but it's not problems, for me though, maps is working fine, only thing is you won't be able to see is where you're facing.\nThe camera I would say is average, not bad, but average, I'm not much of a camera guy as I rarely click pictures but for someone who uses camera a lot and pictures are really important, I would suggest looking for something else.\nRest all is good, UI is very clean, lacks features like app lock and many others(like those you get in MIUI) but had they been there the whole point of stock android would have rendered invalid.\nMy final suggestion would be that, if you can take the risk of having \"some\" ads and bloatware and can keep up with issues like occasional heating, go for Redmi Note 10 Pro; It's far better and that too only because of its physical appearance, I say this because a mobile device which ain't easy to carry and use is no good because that's what a mobile is meant to be, small, compact and easily usable. But if general security, software and a feeling of having almost no basic problems(like heating, calling etc.) matter to you then go for Moto G40 fusion because this thing is all you can ask for in this price, and at this price you will have to compromise on something to get something, here in this case the physical appearance.\nNot uploading any pictures as they would get pixelated anyways, so no point of uploading them.",
            "What a beast it is. Extraordinary performance.\nStock Android does the magic. No unwanted Apps & bloats\nScreen refresh rate is like butter.\nCamera is superb, just bit disappointed by front camera.\nBattery is huge & it will take 1 & half day for a person like me to drain all the juice.\nValue for Money.\nI am in love with handset. Thank you Moto\n\nP.S: Handset shown in picture is my another handset, photo is closed clicked by G40",
            "Writing this review after one month of meticulous usage.\n\nI'm a fan of Moto not only for its simplistic near stock and clean OS, but also for its exceptional battery backup and turbo charging capabilities.\n\nThis new phone is truly a power-packed device with an excellent battery, fast processor, ample storage, smooth 120Hz refresh rate, clean OS and a pair of decent lenses. Yes, the camera is generally where moto lags behind other makers, however, for this one, moto added a nice camera (both front and back). The macro and the wide-angle both performs fine and exceeds my expectations.\n\nI've added a few photographs so that people can understand the quality.\n\nAs I already told, I use my phone meticulously, from office work in outlook and excel to booking cabs, bus and train tickets, ordering food, grocery, doctor consultation, online shopping, watching webseries, gaming and what not. The performance is absolutely lag free and 120Hz refresh rate just adds up to make it smoother. The screen is pretty big, so for small-palmed people it might feel a bit bulky, but its okay considering the massive 6000mAh battery.\n\nIn nutshell, it's a value for money.",
            "Been using G40 for a month now, good phone. Always wanted to use the phone with stock Andriod and Moto has delivered it.\nCamers looks good though performance is not great in low light but that's the problem with all the phones.\nDisplay is great with no lag.\nThe only concern is the size of the phone and the weight. With cover it feels a bit heavy but you will get used to of it.\n\nGot in at the price of 13.7k ( 128 GB version ) and not expecting much at this price range.\n\nTurbocharger charge the phone in around 90 odd minutes and it stays live for me than 1.5 days.\n\nAdded both day and night in picture taken today",

I had to buy this phone and after 1 week of usage can safely say that this is a fantastic buy.\nThe display is large and awesome, battery is humongous and camera is very good.

            "I have used it for 8 days now. And I can say that the phone really worth the money. Display is damn good. You can stream content on Netflix in 1080p. And the display colours are good. Battery is also good, it lasts one day and gives me 8 to 9 hours of screen time. You will not face any lagging while multitasking. Sound output is also good via phone speaker, bluetooth headset, earphones it gives really good sound output. And you can play games in high graphics and it really do not get that much heated up as others are saying while playing games (call of duty,genshin impact) the games runs very smoothly.There are a lot of gestures available for easy usage.camera is really good it gives you really a very wide dynamic range of colours,yes it do take 3 -4 seconds to process the photo but captured images are really good.front camera is also good gives you quite pleasant selfies.",
            "Good product. The camera and display performance is praiseworthy. There is no hanging and heat issue. Mobile is working smoothly and the network connection also working perfect. Only drawback is the charging of battery take too much of time around 2 hours for full charge. Recommended for those who want a decent budget phone. Here I have to mention the service by Flipkart too. They delivered the phone next day itself and packing also very good condition. Thank you Motorola and Flipkart. Recommended for other after 5 days using of this phone.",
            "Average quality product.\nMotorola no more make quality standards products after in hand with lenovo(chinese company).\nThere are 2 type of displays as a technical basis, 1- Microtechnology based used in earlier mobiles which uses micro components and was expensive (flagships still uses this technology) and 2-macrotechnology based uses macro components and was cheaper (tablets and bigger display tabs screen were made out of this).\n\nNow, I have a main concern that now-a-days why every manufacturer building a huge display mobile above 6 inch? It's that it uses less components to build and cheaper quality materials are used. That's why they don't make a handy device anymore in the name of BIG ENTERTAINMENT DEVICE, They just use cheap components and displays are of Tablet quality.\nThis device have 6.8inch display now you can think a display from a tablet attached to the phone. Big heavy bulky device.\nUsers don't know this. Now they will.\nBattery is tiny for this huge and cheap display.\nPerformance is good overall SD processors have the best optimisation for android.\nCamera software is not good but it will work great after Gcam apk installation.\n\nOnly one major update from Motorola now. This is purely non acceptable from a brand this old and device at this price.",

Comes with three applications of Facebook (yeah! you read it right)\nThere are facebook's services.\n2. There is touch sensitivity lag everywhere except when using app drawer\n\nPretty much, thats it !\nOverall a good phone you can trust with and go for.",

            "I have used the Phone for more than 2 months. The phone has a decent screen and camera performance. The low light photographs are dark. Sometimes screen (may be due to android or app) response is slow. It works fine overall. If you watch video 2 -3 hrs with other normal usage, still the battery can last upto 20-24 hrs. If you are traveling with GPS ON it can last upto 15 hrs easily. This phone is my 5th moto phone. It is not the best camera phone compared to earlier ones but it is best in battery. If set to battery saver mode can go beyond 30 hrs.\nAlso, it has near to stock android and good new gesture unlike 3 button. Initially you may find difficult, but once you get used to it will be very easy compared to 3 button android phones. Also, you still have the option to go for 3 button.\nIf you need a decent performing camera phone with a great battery backup can choose this phone.",

Good for gaming since the processor is hugh end. If you wish to have more storage , go for 128 GB model. Other 64GB 4GB ram is the best value for money. Between this and G60, only few differences, lack of NFC, 64MP camera compared to 108MP in G60. Same performance, same battery, for a lower price. Great overall feel in hand. Only disadvantage is back is a fingerprint magnet but a cover can solve it that comes inside the box.",

            "Review after 5 days of usage\nTyping this review in moto g40 fusion 6gb 128gb dynamic grey varient\n\n1) Perfomance / software (5/5): At this price range this phone gives you the best performance since it has clean and neat stock android experience and no ads or bloatwares like miui or realme poco etc. Powered with Snapdragon 732g it is just smooth and flawless (better processor when compared to Exynos and mediatek which we get at this price range).\n\n2) Display (4/5): Best thing is it's 120hz display and it's FHD+ display but not AMOLED display, so colors are not that vibrant and punchy, but gets the job done. Screen size is very big (6.8) so it might feel bulky with big screen. This phone is not for someone who likes compact and small phones.\n\n3) Battery (5/5): It has tremendous 6000mAh battery and easy last long for more than one day with moderate usage. Since it is stock android the battery won't drain quickly and it is power efficient. Since it has got large battery and big screen, it is very thick and bulky (220gms), but weight management is done very well, so you will get adjusted to it quickly. Then about charging we get 20watt fast charger, it's not very fast but it's decent since battery is 6000mAh.\n\n4) Storage (5/5): 6gb, 128gb is more than sufficient (4gb, 64gb I doubt), RAM management is done very well since it is stock android and internal storage we get 115gb free (in case of 128gb), since no pre installed bloatwares, storage is not a issue here.\n\n5) Camera (3/5): Camera are not that good because we get better camera at this price range (samsung), but it's decent and it has lot of features like night camera, macro, etc. If you want a camera phone, then this is not a good phone for you. But it's good for day to day usage.\n\n6) Design / Build quality (4/5): The varient which I choose is very good and gives premium look, but it is finger print magnet and it's made of plastic. Build quality is very good looks sturdy with splash proof (haven't tried).\n\n7) Speakers (3/5): They are loud but not stereo speakers and earpiece is very loud so that the back panel starts to vibrate if you keep at high volume. The 3.5mm headphone jack output is also not that great but decent.\n\n8) Gaming (5/5): If you are a gamer then this phone is for you, 120hz refresh rate, large battery and fast processor, you can play lag free.\n\n9) Call quality and network (internet) (5/5): Call quality is good and loud and even clear. Internet quality is very fast and download takes place within seconds. And also comes with hybrid sim slot\n\n10) Finger print sensor (4/5): It's accurate but takes times to unlock. Side mounted finger print would have been better.\n\n11) Other features (5/5): It has very cool gestures by moto like turning on camera and flash light and even some smart features from Google. A dedicated seperate physical button to launch google assistant and sadly it's not customisable.\n\n12) Overall (4/5): It is good phone at this price range with good performance and stock android ui with decent camera performance.\n\nPros:\n1)Great performance.\n2)Stock android with no bloatwares.\n3)Very huge battery life.\n4)120hz refresh rate.\n5)Premium look.\n6)Powerful processor.\n7)Nice gesture by moto and cool features from Google.\n\nCons:\n1)Average camera performance.\n2)No amoled display.\n3)Heavy and bulky.\n4)No stereo speakers.\n5)Finger print magnet design.\n6)No magnetometer so no compass.\n\nOverall it's a good phone, people who want stock android can purchase this without a second thought!",
            "Everything is great. But buy only if you can hold a bit large heavy phone (not for small hands :P) . I wish the speaker could have a sweeter voice (for music) although it's loud enough. The speakers are towards the lower side of the phone which has its pros and cons. The android is pretty clean though comes with quite a few useless apps. I am a basic user so won't really go into the details about performance or camera... But it's good enough for me. Also I wish the phone could have a few more of its own apps. It relies a lot on Google apps - eg files, gallery. Battery backup has been good. Given my basic usage, the phone doesn't heat much. I hope this will help you make a choice here. It's tough to pick a phone today given so many confusing options. But I think this phone is good enough at this price. Need not really run after 5G compromising other features to fit ones budget at this point of time. Comes with security too! And some AI which I still need to understand. Display seems good as well although it's not oled.",
            "I'm writing this review after 2 weeks of usage. Privously I used honor 9 lite. An upgrade this from a 5.4 inch to 6.8 inch had made lot of change. It's display is amazing although it's an ips LCD but Compared with the budget amoled display this is butter smooth. The camera performance is also amazing. Though struggles at night about the night vision keep ups. My priority was stock android with a better camera and a better performance chipset. SD 732 is good. I'm happy with this purchase.\nThe only con I found is it's thickness.",
            "Best stock Android experience. Moto has given high priority to user Privacy. Battery backup is excellent. More than 3days for normal use. Camera is decent with pro features. Hardware quality is best at this competitive price. Smooth and glossy finishing gives a premium quality look. Diplay is lcd but brighness and clarity is equal to amoled. I have used a month. No cons i found so far. Budget mobile but gives a feeling of a high budget mobile. Never worry about fast charging. Reaches full charge in 1.5 to 2hrs. Battery management is excellent which gives good backup of altleast two days when used frequently whole day.\nMoto has given their best ever!! Just go for it!! Budget and yet powerful mobile..",
            "This is a value for money product.\nThe stock android 11 experience is smooth, battery backup is good, IPS LCD screen is top notch (not comparable with AMOLED), decent visibility under sunlight.\nSpeaker is loud.\n\nBased on a few reviews I thought the phone may be bulky, but the distribution is even (I am used to it coming from an iPhone 7 Plus); the fingerprint scanner is optimally placed in the rear. Camera is good. Exceeds my expectations.\n\nIn my subjective opinion, it is a worthy phone. I would recommend this.\nThank you Moto.\n\nEfficient packaging and delivery process. Thank you TREASURE HAUL ONLINE and FLIPKART.\nHappy with the purchasing experience.",

No unnecessary apps, has many gesture and hidden features..\n\nPerformance is very smooth.. Battery last for 1.5days easily for me (review after 10 days)\n\nPhone is little heavy because of battery, back panel design could have been better",
            "Has been using for a week. Was using Samsung M30s before, very good phone, compact and sleek, AMOLED display\n\nPros: Big screen, Good battery life ( increases significantly on dark theme. I get 2 days life with intermittent net use). Clear display. Fast enough. Front flash. Balanced weight. Camera is good, nothing exceptional. Champagne white is an elegant colour. Connectivity is good even indoors.\n\nCons: AMOLED is the rule these days, Software ( Motorola seriously has to improve software versetility. Samsung, Vivo etc have made their user interface much better over years, Moto still dragging on), No LED notification ( Had get a 3rd paty app), NFC could have been nice, Hybrid sim slot.\n\nCan't comment on gaming.\nMy verdict: Good phone for price, great hardware, but a better software and UI would have given it much more teeth.",
            "I have been using this phone for last 8 months. My strong reason to buy this phone is \ud83d\udc93Stock Android\ud83d\udc93. I was fed up with third party apps and ads on my previous phone (Vivo).\n\nI have listed out pros and cons of the device considering various departments.\n\nPROS:\n1. Operating System is clean and there is no junk at all.\n2. Since it's stock Android combined with Qualcomm SOC\nperformance is so smooth. Kudos to Snapdragon 732.\n3. Even though display is LCD, it's quite good for watching\nvideos. For my device there are no tint issues.\n4. Sound quality is very nice.\n5. Great Battery backup, For an aggressive user like me\ncharge will last for 6-8 hours. If you are a normal user\nit will definitely last for one and half day.\n6. Haptic, most of the people won't consider this. But, this\ndevice has great haptic feedback.\n7. RAM management is cool. Most often apps won't\nreload.\n\nCONS:\n1. Both rear and front cameras are okish.\n2. Device is bulky and it's heavy.\n3. Charging time is not so fast even though 20W fast\ncharger is used. Since battery power is heavy (6000\nmAh).\n4. Rear mount finger print sensor.",

I think this is the only smart phone which is equipped with snapdragon at this price point.\n*not a fully gaming phone but very capable .u can play u won't be disappointed\nCons\n-heavy\n-decent camera\n-old designed",
            "First of all the mostly disappointed thing for me is that there is no gallery icon in this phone all of you photos directly save in Google photos...\n2nd one is the brightness I m not happy with the brightness.\nCamera is good this mobile has many good features that I really love and I never knew about such kind of features before..\nBattery is good not very good I guess\nIt heats after 2-3 hrs long work but normalise automatically in few minutes.\nAnd one more thing is the hybrid sim slot you can only insert 2sim or 1 sim and a memory card at a time.\nScreenshot is not supporting during call...I wish there is any alternative of taking screenshot in the mobile.\nOverall \ud83d\udc4d nice",

Struggles in low light condition. Though capture decent in ample light.\n\nVerdict\n\nBest phone under 15k range. Prefer it over poco m2 pro, and redmi note 10 pro etc.",
            "This is the best stock android budget phone one can get. Absolute beast battery, terrific display and 120hz refresh is perfect. Coming to cameras, they are average but if one installs gcam then the performance just goes from average to very good. It's just the processing which is bad for default camera which could be fixed with a software update. Battery is flawless, I charge my phone once in 42-44 hours with screen on time usually goes upto 14-16 hours.",
            "I use Motorola phone since 2016. So I know Motorola performance is very good .\n1. Camera quality is ok. It gives real photos no beauty filter use.\n2 SD 732G is performance is very good.\n3 6000 mh better backup is real. No complain.\n4 Display quality is Average. Because no amoled panel.\n5. Sound quality is also good and clear.\n6. Phone weight not so light. Or not so heavy.\n7. It also supports Carrier aggregation or 4G+",
            "Writing this review after more than a month use. I am currently using this phone and it is awesome.\n\nIt is a great phone for a student 'cause I am a student. Battery \ud83d\udd0b life is good. I charge it once in every 2 days. I have to study so much PDFs and this phone's battery supports.\n\nCamera quality is also good. Portrait pictures are great. Macro photography, cinematograph, colour pop, low light photos, smiles and gestures to capture and much more features are available for a professional photography. It also has a scan feature to capture all my notes and I love that feature, very easy to make PDF with this feature.\n\nResolution is also great, can watch movies so clear and the battery doesn't dies.Selfies are so clear and camera captures stable pictures even when phone's a little shaky.\n\nStorage is 120GB which is enough for me, so no need to worry about space. I have so many ebooks and movies downloaded. All the memories captured are stored without any worry about storage.\n\nIt's 6GB RAM is great and it works so smoothly on 120Hz without any lagging.\n\nProcessor is just awesome, it has the fastest processor of Snapdragon which does not heat up at all even after watching movies or reading ebooks continuosly for hours.\n\nThe speaker is also really good. Music \ud83c\udfb6 comes out so great, can also change the bass, enhance sounds and change audio settings for how we want to listen the music.\n\nMicrophone is also strong that catches even whispers so loud and clear.\n\nTurbo charger charges the phone so quick and battery remains for long.\n\nIt also has Moto Actions for flashlight, camera, screenshot, gestures, swipe to split etc which helps a lot. Moto features are really good.\n\nPrice is cheap in accordance with all the qualities of this phone. Overall this is a good choice.",
            "A overall good product . Looks are good. Camera is outstanding. I am little bit disappointed with display and phone weight and size. It would be better if screen size and weight is less. Another two things is missing that is super amoled display and fast charging.\n\nUsing this phone from past 4 months .\n\n\nOverall very good experience in term of performance and fell. Weight and screen size with brightness is the issue.",
            "First of all, the battery backup is excellent and could easily last upto one day or more of bulk use.However due to this, the charging is relatively slow and take more than 2hrs to charge from 0 to 95.Camera is decent (not a camera guy).No heating problem experienced till now. Face lock needs to improve .\nOverall gives really smooth performance and experience and i would surely recommend it.\nPhone is little bulky(not a problem for me) will get used to it with time. I would recommend to buy all the necessary accessories online as items such as tempered glass and back cover were not available at local shops for me",
            "Best phone ever I'm reviewing this after 1 month of use\n\n1.battery backup is superb but it takes some time to charge it takes around 1 and a half hour to full charge\n\n2.camera is decent but could have been some better but fine\n\n3.games like pubg also run smoothly without lag\n\n4. Overall value for money",
            "It's my first time with Moto..Before that I used resmi Note 5 pro which was my favorite phone but then my phone broke and I nee to buy new phone..So everyone suggest me to go for Moto40 fusion which was under my budget..So ifter buying and using i am really satisfied..It's a Hardy set with stock android that means no adds which is a relief for me ..I was pissedoff by the MIUI adds and bloatwares..Rear camera is good ,display and touch is really smooth , battery is really good,it gives you 1 day full battery without gaming and this phone is not that much heavy , i can handel this phone with my one hand... I like the slow charging method..the 20w turbo charger is not very slow but not super speedy..Bit the selfie camera is not good..Moto could give a better quality selfie camera but it's ok because they have focused on phone performance which is pretty quick and good..It has many cool gestures also..So you can go for it without thinking..",
            "The box was not properly sealed. This seriously made me question the authenticity of the product delivered.\nApart from this:\nCamera is pretty average considering the price range.The shutter speed is very low.\nDisplay is good enough.\nThe battery is phenomenal.\nUser interface is smooth as butter.\n\nFinal verdict: If you're buying it for normal daily use, this is the one of the best in its price range , apart from camera.",
            "Writing this review after 3 days of usage.\n\u202208/10 Camera: I haven't faced any issues with camera so far pictures are colour accurate and maintains good quality even after zooming. Night mode is useless better take pictures in pro mode according to the available lights or with the flashlight.\n\u202208/10 Display: Even though it is very bright LCD but can't outperform sAmoled, if you are in direct sunlight you won't see screen properly unless you set the brightness to 100%.\n\u202209/10 Processor: SD 732G is good enough for any regular app but if you are a heavy gamer I would rate this processor 7/10 You can play BGMI in HD(High) or Balanced(Ultra).\n\u202208/10 Speakers: Lack of stereo speakers even though the built in speakers are of good quality but if you want the best experience you will need headphones.\n\u202210/10 Battery: Its massive 6000 mAh lasts 2 days of normal usage. (@60Hz, social media, camera and light apps)\n\u202207/10 Build Quality: It has plastic back instead of glass. It doesn't feel heavy!!! even though the phone is almost A centimeter thick but it is big in size too so it doesn't look bulky 20.5/9 aspect ratio makes it a long phone.\nOnly Cons I found is lack of sAMOLED.",
            "So I loved this phone so much everything is so good u can make good reels in this phone for vlogging purpose this phone is good everything is good battery display \u263a \ud83d\udc93 and don't think much just buy it \ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd0d best phone <3\nI'm a small youtuber it will be great if u can check out my yt channel \" Akshita Kapoor \"",
            "Excellent phone from Motorola. There's all the pros you can have, I'll mention the cons.\n\n- The phone is bulky. And you add a cover, it makes it even bulkier.\n- The phone is heavier than average phones, but considering the hardware on offer I don't mind.\n- The screen size is too long. It's a 6.8 inch display, forget single handed operation.\n- Being a motorola, you'll have a tough time sourcing accessories. You won't find any covers or screen guards easily in local shops, and I stay in Mumbai. So only option for accessories is online.\n\nPros being the battery, the display, the device, gaming is good, charge time is good. Overall if you are thinking wether to buy or not, go for it.",
            "A great phone..... Big battery life (charge it to 90 to 95 percent and use it for the whole day)..... Good for gaming..... Camera is not great.... But I think future updates will resolve the issues.... It is a bit heavy..... But the phone is perfect at this price range...",
            "This review is after almost 2 weeks of use.\n\nPROS:\n1. Good display even though it's not an AMOLED screen, the 120hz feels smooth and responsive and the color and viewing angles are decent.\n\n2. The phone is fast and snappy and has no problems multitasking and switching between multiple apps. There are certain apps where there is a slight lag but overall the\nphone is fast and efficient.\n\n3. Clean android 11 experience with Motorola's MYUI is way better than any custom UI out there, it is fast, efficient, and simple with almost no bloatware. though it lacks\ncertain customization options if you are coming from MIUI, ONEUI, etc. but it can easily be solved by 3rd party apps available on playstore.\n\n4. Good battery back-up, lasts almost a whole day on my use (fairly heavy usage) and still has some juice left at the end of the day. I had no issues gaming and\nstreaming the whole day.\n\n5. Camera is decent for the price, the pictures are sharp and clear though low light photography could have been better.\n\nCONS:\n1. The size (6.8inches) can be pretty huge for some people, the phone is on the heavier side, it's balanced well but people with small hands will find it difficult to use.\none-handed operation is also quite difficult.\n\n2. The google button is mostly useless and it's placed above the volume buttons which makes it irritating because it gets pressed when changing volume. It should have\nbeen placed on the opposite edge.\n\n3. Fingerprint sensor is placed on the back, it could have been a side-mounted one, as most phones are these days.\n\n4. The camera and the camera software could have been a little better, as it takes some time to process the pictures.\n\n5. Gaming performance is average, BGMI and COD runs fairly well on medium-high settings without any heating and or lag, The fps drops a little while playing Genshin\nImpact or any other demanding games. So not suitable for heavy or extended periods of gaming.\n\nFinal review:\nOverall the phone is awesome and a complete value for money. The overall experience using it has been good as I prefer my phone to be clean, simple, and functional without any ads or bloatware. If you are tired of all those bloatware and ad ridden UIs, Motorola's UI will be a fresh breath of change for you. At this price range, Motorola G40 FUSION is the perfect phone which does not cut many corners when it comes to performance and functionality.\n\nIf you have a budget of Rs21000-25000, I would suggest going for Motorola Edge20 FUSION as it addresses many of the problems of this phone and also is 5G ready.",
            "Moto G40 fusion is worth for price\nStock Android phone at medium price\nAverage camera.\nBattery is good but not full filled the expectation because it's 6000mah battery\nPhone is always warm even using 5 mins also I feel the heat\nWhile playing games Display brightness is automatically decreasing and getting heat",
            "Using it for 3 weeks..Excellent phone at budget price. Camera is good, many reviews say camera is average, but it's not so. Camera images are natural and not fakely saturated like other phones. Weight is well distributed and u don't feel heavy. Display is too good. Got some excellent and unique gestures.",
            "An amazing budget smartphone, that lasted for more than 2 days after full charge.\n\nThis review is based on usage for 2 days on a full charge being depleted after a good amount of gaming, browsing social media, chatting on WhatsApp and plenty of calls.\n\nThe sound quality of the mobile is good and loud on speaker. With the headphones on, the audio effects kicked in to enhance the sound output of whatever you watch, play or listen.\n\nI'm not much camera guy, but the camera is decent enough for capturing your memories like the regular smartphones do.",
            "Writing this review post 7-8 days of usage, overall good phone and I am satisfied with this purchase. A bit enhancement required from Motorola on external speakers, it must be with Dolby Atmos however it's just fine.",
            "This product is so good but after using more than 2 month, I feel little glitch. It's display stuck sometime (it happens only two time but yes this is a Problem so I mention here).\nI am Fully satisfied with this camera, but battery uses time is also good. For normal user like me it last for 2 days.\nThank you for reading my review.",
            "I am writting this after the use of 3 and a half months.\nTouch response time is very slow, even buttons are not so responsive you need to press them hard, screen also is often not responsive. Camera also isn't good, I had moto x4 before which was far better the this.\nDon't buy it . There are better option.",
            "This mobail is better on Motorola price ranges. Display is nice and lettle bet heating were charging and using camera. Don't expect better camera. Prosessor is good. If like heavy and think phone it's better. it's look like classy.",

            "Thermal Review: (3/5)*\nTried CPU Stress Test and it is reaching 85c - 90c in the cores of the CPU... Overall Product feels slightly warmer than rest of the phones even with light usage. (This maybe due to high temperature in CPU core, which leads to throttling of performance)\n\n*Might be possible that I received a defective model which is overheating, so I can't confirm if this is the case for everyone or not... (Please reach out to me and confirm if this is happening for everyone or not)\n\nMy Geekbench Score: Single Core: 557, Multi Core: 1494\n\n\nRam Management: (4/5)\nReally good. Better than usual competitors like Realme and Xiaomi out there.\n\nDisplay: (4/5)\nEven if not AMOLED, you can't go wrong with this screen! It's gorgeous to look at. The phone doesn't feel as narrow as you imagine it to be...\n\nCameras: (2.5/5)\nGood daylight photos but with oversharpening but still decent to look at. However, in Low light performance for video is absolute disaster. Even my 4 year old Moto g5 Plus with 12.2MP (f/1.7) camera had better details and lower noise than the usual camera application provided in Moto g40 fusion.\nI won't recommend this phone to camera enthusiasts out there. But those who are okay with that can still use Gcam and get better results from it.\n\nBattery: (4.5/5)\nIt's just absolute beast! Got 8.5 hours of Screen on time with 35% juice still remaining but I decided to charge it. (My usage does not involve gaming)\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nOverall in my 2 day usage I'd recommend this to anyone who requires a phone with very good performance and best ram management in its price segment with STOCK UI.",

            "The important question is why you would buy the Motorola Moto G40 Fusion phone. In conclusion, you get the best in budget. Coming with a big screen, the perfect refresh rate for gaming, fabulous performance with a brilliant chipset, and huge battery, the Motorola Moto G40 Fusion proves to be the best cost-effective smartphone. Not to forget that there is no 5G support, so if you are not looking for a 5g phone the Moto G40 Fusion is the best option for you.",

            "I used it for 2 months and would say its a decent phone if you are looking for strong phone and concerned about privacy\nIt has great privacy level compared to other brands with nice stock android interface\nWorks fine, No storage and display issue but yes it is heavier compared to other phones at same price\ncamera and other specs are fine\nGood phone if you want a strong phone with best privacy protection",

I felt the screen to display ratio is little less as it should be more at the bottom and the upper part should be more and available to the camera.\n3. The screen guard is pretty hard to get.\n4. It takes slightly more time to charge as the charger is of 20W only.\n5. The clearing interface is at the end, which needs to be updated or you can use 3rd party app.",

Display is a let down in daylight, its good for inside the home usage though. Camera is just about ok. Stock android and processor is lag free.\nCharging takes 2.35 min for full charge. There are obvious cost cuttings evident, but I'm not complaining except for the display.\n\nHow about this idea: Why not give a 6\" screen with 4500mah battery with amoled and 90hz refresh rate and higher nits. 12mp camera with better optimization.",

Comparing the phone to MI was a difficult task. I think both the phones has its own perks. Small things like call recording, image optimisation etc. But after using it for like two months, I have fallen in love with her. Her elegant designs and curves. Oh man..she never put me down. The minimal UI and 128gb internal, 6gb ram and that most powerful processor in the segment. I am happy with her.\n\nI THINK THIS IS THE START OF A BEAUTIFUL FRIENDSHIP.",

I am using moto from last 6years nd I do used to recommend it to my friends and family as well. But not this one. It have disappointed me on this price range.. Device is not even handy and it's very heavy. Evry time you have to use both hands. Even when playing Battle ground. It feels heavy and not enough grip. Storage only you get 104gb from 128 so am not sure if it is pure stock android. And the last battery life.. if you are even a moderate user who uses YouTube for few hours a day and a little bit of gaming you have to charge it twice. This device does not even deserve 2stars.

Also the audio it's in the lower side.\n\nIam facing a some major issue with this phone.If the camera application is opened for 3-4 min the temperature of the phone increases rapidly (I think it's because, when the camera is in use the entire screen brightnens up which is causing this issue). And the DnD and swipe of split options does not work.\n\nI prefer Motorola phones b'cause you get a pure android eand clean UI experience but they miss to test certain functionalities which can be critical to the users and it's target market decide to buy a different product.\n\nIt's a average phone with some issues which can be fixed by some software updates.\n\n\"Motorola please work on the basics\"\n\nNote: This product does not come with NFC as advertised.Might be G60 has this functionality.",

            "Very poor sound",
            "First and foremost, never choose a smartphone based on pure specifications on paper. Moto g40 fusion seems to be a steal deal for one who looks for a Snapdragon 732g phone but it doesn't have any ergonomic design.\nFirst few days of using the phone you have to adjust to the heavyweight of the phone.\nMajor pros:\n1) On paper has good value for money specifications\nAnd that's all for me in that.\nMajor Cons:\n1) Heavyweight\n2) Poor build quality, the phone literally makes creaking sound when you accidentally touch the back panel\n3) Poor overall design, when you move around your palms across the phone, you can feel the irregularities near the display and body joint which is strange for a 2021 phone from a brand like this( just for name sake it is Motorola, it's just a phone made in Padget electronics)\n4) Power button stopped it's working after a month's of use.\n5) My 2019 Nokia 5.1 plus has better camera than this moto 64 mp gimmick.\n\nSo I have very poor impressions on this product, eventhough some brands use less powerful processors at this price range they are atleast having good build quality (eg:samsung from our experience).",

The photos are crisp with natural colours.Night Sight on Gcam is brilliant as well\nThe battery might seem huge, but with a 6.8 inch 120 Hz display to power, it again, is satisfactory.\nThe speakers are loud enough, bottom firing is a bit annoying as they do tend to get covered up\nThe performance is really the top aspect. 6gb of ram with the 732G , couples with 120 Hz and it really feels like you're blazing through apps.\nIt can be difficult to operate with one hand, and is a bit heavy, but you get used to it\nOverall I'd say I'm happy with the phone!",

Recently switched from Moto One power to the G40 and first thing u notice is the Massive Size. It\u2019s easy to hold as it\u2019s not wide but impossible to navigate the whole screen with one hand for people with small to medium hands. Specially ladies might have trouble using this one hand. However u gt used to it in a week.\n\nComing to the performance and battery life, this is Bingo !!! Stutter free scrolling and faster app opening makes it an ideal budget smart phone. The camera is okay (3.5/5) but not bad. Obviously this is not a camera centric phone.\n\nWatching videos in this aspect ratio feels weird as it blacks out on the left and right. The speakers are loud and clear till u reach the max volume where is sounds a little distorted. However I won\u2019t be at the max volume until ur in loud places. The speaker is loud enough at about half the volume.\n\nThe battery is amazing but the charging is slow. A bigger battery needs faster charger which moto is slowly coming upto.\n\nOverall a very good budget smart phone for people with big hands \ud83d\ude09",

Camera clarity is good (I see mixed reviews from customers but I liked it personally)\n3. The wide screen is good to watch the movies crystal clear\n\nNegatives:\n\n1. Could have had 2 inbuild speakers instead of one for better sound quality\n2. Few may feel its hard to carry it in pocket because of the size\n3. Finger sensor lock doesn't seem to work in my set, still I am trying to find time to explore it if not reach the customer service\n\nOverall it's a very good purchase for the price it was offered.

Here are the pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n\u2022 The moto MyUx offers a stock android experience without any bloatware or ads, and offers some customisation for the icons and gestures, eg: live wallpapers and a game mode\n\u2022 This phone\u2019s the most affordable SD732G in India as per the time of this writing.\n\u2022 The gaming experience for PUBG is superb, with no lags at smooth graphics and ultra-frame rate. For free fire max, experience is smooth.\n\u2022 Camera app is a little bit cumbersome to use, but the photos are the sharpest quality in the 15k budget. Also, it offers AR stickers and a good night mode.\n\u2022 120 Hz refresh rate with FHD+(1440p) resolution is a good choice\n\u2022 95 % software is Google services, giving good Google integration.\n\n\nCons:\n\u2022 Heavy weight, large dimension and screen size takes much time getting used to.\n\u2022 The google one ,Yt music and google tv app cant be uninstalled.\n\u2022 Overheats a lot while charging and playing game above 30 mins.\n\u2022 People migrating to Motorola from redmi will miss many features like applock and camera lock screen shortcut (the moto actions has gestures to compensate for that).\n\u2022 Google photos app \u2018s photo editing need paid membership to unlock, but most of the free features are superb and do the trick.",

            "1 Looks & Design-4/5 Looks and design is very good. I like it very much and it looks like a premium phone. Due to the glossy design of the back, fingerprints and scratches are more likely to occur. The display is very good quality, very good for multimedia, punch hole display design gives a very stunning look. Gorilla Glass Protection should be provided which is not provided.\n2 Camera-3/5 The features of the camera are very good and give a lot but the 64 megapixel camera does not give such a good result. Before this I had realme 3 pro which had better photos than this.\n3 Performance-4/5 Performance is very good yet mobile never hangs. Heavy game can also run very well and in high setting.\n4 Bettery-4/5 As the battery is 6000mAh, it can be used all day long, but with the box only a 20 watt charger is provided which takes about two and a half to three hours to charge the mobile full. Nowadays, many companies offer fast chargers with more than 30 watts, even in the lower price range, while a charger with 20 watts cannot be considered as a fast charger.\n5 Others Features-3/5 The app lock defect appears inside the feature. The clone app is also not provided.The fingerprint sensor works well but the face unlock features do not work properly. Otherwise the features of Motorola are good which allows you to personalize. And no additional application is provided which is a good thing.",

Fast loading of apps.\n- Similar to stock android experience without any extra apps.\n\nCons\n- Size may be a problem for some people. Single hand use is difficult.\n- The phone is heavier than average. You can get accustomed to it and after a while it doesn't feel heavy. But if you use a case, it will surely feel heavy and be uncomfortable after long use. For comfortable use, if you aren't clumsy and won't drop it, don't use a case.\n- At full volumes, the sound starts to feel noisy and grainy.\n- Front camera pictures look bad in artificial lighting. They show innacurate colours and face tone looks very pale.",

I have used lenovo K6 power with 4000mah battery before this phone which has given a far more better battery experience ( 2 to 3 days) than this 6000mah battery. After turning on Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and location in this phone no logos are appeared / visible on the display area, which is a new experience to me. Either I have to go to the status bar or I have to go to the settings menu to check the Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and location are on or off. This phone doesn't have any default Massage, File Manager or Phone app, this phone is using Google phone, Google Massage and Google Files as default app. It means if any time Google stop their services in India this phone will be a plastic box, which is not expected at this price point.",

Best part for me is 6000mAh battery and nearly stock android experience. Some improvements can be done in display as it's brightness is a little less when compared to its competitor and for that massive battery a higher power charge would be better, 20W is a little slow and 30W would be a lot better. Also would like to point out that if you play BGMI then there will be a slight frame drop if you hot drop. Overall a great, value for money product.",

I have small hands ,i like medium sized phones .yet this can be handle easily..\n\nOnly \ud83d\udc4e downside I don't like - 224g weight Plus bulky design 9.7 mm thickness which is almost 1mm thicker than other thinner phones (which is not much of a problem when u handle it).if you are obsessed with slim and light weight phones ,then don't buy this.\nCamera is not good as of my iphone 7, .despite this has a 64 mp shooter and other features. It's average for most people.may be it will get better with future AI camera software updates.i am not a camera guy ,so i don't consider it much .I think selfie is also an average one .May be, they use branded lens it may get better .rest is upon camera software ..\n\nI think this android 11 has a smoother feel than ios15.\nThank you \u270c\ufe0f",

This needs to be reduced.\n3) No clarity of minimum OS upgrade & minimum years of security.\n4) Finger print sensors at back are bit outdated. Could have been on side or under display.\n5) Charger should have been 25W as the one given in box is just 20W.\n6) Dedicated Google assistant Button may not be useful to many people.

The aesthetics of the pictures are just very dope\n\u2022 HUGE BATTERY 6000 mAh \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\u2022 overall this device is really GREAT\n\nCONS:\n\u2022 There are literally NO CASED available on market for this device \ud83d\ude02\n\u2022 You can't interact with MEDIA (play, pause and all stuff) through lock screen, it's kinda annoying\n\u2022 Doesn't have NFS and Compass Sensor (I don't care about that)\n\u2022 MACRO LENS, sometimes it takes alot to grab focus \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f hope they fix it by software update.\n\u2022 REFRESH RATE, I felt the phone was struggling alot to keep the refresh rate stable.

            "This feedback is not really on the product, but about the process of exchange. In one word pathetic from Flipkart. I wanted to exchange an old Moto phone while buying a new one. In the site, the checks which determines the value of the phone were given as screen crack / discoloration / touch isn't working / screen coming out; de-shaped / bent / cracks & part missing. The exchange value was given upto Rs. 2650 & payment was also computed based on that. Since my phone had no issues as per the criteria mentioned, i assumed the exchange value will be around that. When the delivery person from Flipkart came, he started saying that the edge of the phone had undulations etc. It seemed he came ready with it - that he will not give the due exchange amount. I asked him to show me the written criteria against which my phone is failing to qualify. He failed to do so. He said the max. value that can be offered is Rs. 1100. Since he could not show me any written criteria and was not able to connect me to someone with whom I can check on the same, I decided not to argue with him and instead, paid the extra amount & cancelled the exchange. The phone is in a very good condition with no cracks, bends etc., and I preferred to keep it as back up instead of exchanging it for a paltry Rs. 1100. But, the overall experience was very bad. The lack of transparency, clarity ..... something I never expected from Flipkart. Very very bad experience, very bitter. I will never recommend a exchange in Flipkart. I am highly dejected.",

BUT WAIT... all that glitters are not gold...!\nThe major problem I faced is that the touch is not very responsive to precise movements, which makes playing games, especially shooting games unplayable, editting photos , writing something on the screen is also very difficult. I thought the IPS display would be of good quality becz it's rivals are providing amoled at the same price point, but again I was wrong.... The viewing angles are bad, when compared to my 5yrs old redmi note 3.\nITS SPEAKERS, They are just disaster on this phone , neither it has clearity , nor they have any base , it's just feels like some cheap chineese phone with loud noise.\nThe CAMERA again is a let down , outdoor pics are somewhat good , but as soon as u come inside, no matter how much light u provide, the pics appear grainy and lack clearity.\nThe SOFTWARE is neither that smooth that it has to be , since it's kind of stock android so I expected to run smoothly, but there are jitters here and there, and sometimes even the UI crashed with heavy usage.\nThe READ WRITE speed is less which results in slightly more app opening time, delay in processing photos, delay in savings photos after editting, slow video rendering.\nSince it's stock , there are no additional features, it might be a con for some and pro for some.\nAnd last but not the least... It's WEIGHT AND THICKNESS.. I don't have problem carrying heavy phone if it's features are good, but this phone doesn't have anything special which will give me the reason to carry that weight.\nAs of now this is my experience, I will update it if there is any improvement after software update.\nNOTE- Many buyers don't even test it properly before posting a review, I have tested it thoroughly and then I found the above problems, so gamers should stay away from this device because the touch really gives an awfully experience while gaming, for casual use its a wonderful phone.\nUPDATE ( AFTER 1MONTH USAGE)- After the 1st software update the touch issue is gone and there is no problem in playing games.\nCAMERA- GCAM is available which improves the camera quality. Macro camera is good but the thing is you have to go very close to the subject, unlike the tele photo lense where you get good macro shots from a distance.\nBATTERY- ITS SIMPLY AWESOME, on moderate usage with single sim and data on always I get 11-13 hrs of SOT, and even with heavy use I never got sot below 10 hrs.\nNETWORK- I get strong 4g+ and the call quality is definitely better than some other devices , it doesn't support wifi tethering.",
