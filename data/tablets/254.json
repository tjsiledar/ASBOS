            "including interest+GST it costs me near about 7300, so this is good to buy at this range, if you have good budget like more than 12-15000 then go for other brands, anyway I am ok with this as I need only for video classes and other videos playings.",
            "The Tablet is good enough for emails and video viewing. Some apps are pre installed for kids. I have been using it for 15 days now, the 3+32 variant, battery life is good as of now. SIM Card slot available, used Jio and it supports Call and Data. A worthy purchase.\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",
            "I have been using this for almost 8 months now. In this period I never faced any problems except occasional non response from the OS. I do not have any games or have inserted sim, and it is just used for studying and videos. It came with a screen protector kind of film. From my experience these are the advantage:\n*Big screen with good display. Movies can be watched without any compromise on picture quality.\n*Great battery life. Lasts whole day with 4-5 hrs of usage.\n*Superb loud sound quality.\n*Price\n\nDisadvantages:\n* Not absolutely lag free performance. Then again, buy after checking if the configuration suits your requirement.\n* VGA like camera quality.\n\nI am satisfied with the product being worth the money.",

            "Wanted to get used to a tab and decided that I wouldn't spend much for this trial! Just then Flipkart sold this tab on a good discount. It is a pretty decent device for 7000 odd Rs (after discount). Videos are crisp if you view it indoor, battery lasts 4 to 6 hours of continuous usage, good enough for ebook reading and editing with office software. But camera is bad, touch is lagging, build quality is poor and material used appears flimsy and cheap.",

            "A well designed machine, but got hurt when you see the plastic polymer body. At this price an Allminium alloy shell body can be provided. The score on value for money could have been enhanced. Otherwise moderately fast processor. Apps loaded are useful. For day to day use at a cheaper price, with a big screen tab - it's good. Acceptable on this price band.",

Camera quality moderate like other tablet . many function input in this hardware system so several number of works properly. Sound quality ( 2 speakers) is vary loud. Network connectivity is very fine. Remember that , It is calling tablet not a high quality smartphone. Some demerits are - -* Outer Design of this tablet is very much pooor . 1. whole body is made from Bakelite plastic materials. So durability & strength ness power is nil. therefore handle properly & gently with extra outer protection is needed. 2. Battery power ( only 4600 may ) is so small & insufficient according to big display (10.1 inch). thus battery exhaust quickly . 3. Touch screen not so good little bit slow . 4. why ? mediatek (mtk-8735B) quadcore processor has been used in place of Qualcomm octacore processor. 5. Since primary processor is just 1.1 GHz so delayed operational response speed. 6. tab is heated moderately under operation & while charging . Otherwise OK tablet on behalf of mine.",

            "Seriously telling i was very excited for this device, but sadly it just can't match my expectations. I am going to try as many relevant points i can to help you guys make a decision.\n\nFirst let's talk about Pros:\n1. Talking over the build quality and display, the device is great.\n2. Ample of storage space for this mid range category that hardly any other tablet provides.\n3. Big screen experience in this price range is just too good to be true, which is very useful for official works, web surfing and reading novels. Screen is bright and easy to eyes while using indoors.\n\nApart from this i didn't find any silver lining in this one. That makes us to look for cons:\n1. Camera is a huge disappointment, both rear and front camera are clearly below average.\n2. Performance of mediatek is below satisfactory. It is that bad that the tab actually starts lagging from the first day if you try to watch videos from youtube.\n3. There are two speaker grills but the sound is not good at all. It feels like the sound is muffled and will ruin your music experience.\n4. Battery drains pretty quick and charging is very slow (thanx to the 5v,1amp charger). However, this can give a backup of about a day on normal usage.\n5. Not a con but i feel that there should be a direct usb port which was there in some of the tablets of the past.\n\nSo, on & on this one is good for official purposes and if you eyeing to purchase it for reading novels and watching offline movies. Anything above this will surely not give you a pleasant experience.!",
            "after using 1 day tablet was good but battery capacity is not so enough overall nice tab i love it",

            "I'm writing this review after using the Tab for 12 days. Performance is good at this price tag. Battery back-up is fair enough considering such big display of 10.1 inch. Device lagging is less as I have played games like Fifa Mobile, Clash of Clans etc. and observed good response. My version is of 3GB, 32Gb and working fine with Android 7 though there are not features included in this OS. Both Front and Rear cameras are not at all appreciable, gives poor quality pictures, also there is no flash. Overall I still liked it as far as it is used for general usage.",
            "This tablet is fast as it has 3GB ram. Speakers are front facing and has good volume. It is the best tablet in its price segment. You won't get 3GB ram along with 10 inch screen at this price.",

This tablet cannot be updated it stuck on nugget 7 everytime you try to update the software it says system is upto date but in reality it's not.\n\nso... This tablet is good for casual use only, I bought this tab thinking it could play Pubg but it didn't, lags so bad in this system.

            "Tha tablet is good. Support 4g volte jio sim. But you can't make diarect video call jio to jio. Even through jio 4g voice app it can't make any video call direct jio to jio.\nCamera quality is VERY BAD also like 2MP\nTouching is not smooth.\nOverall i am not so happy. And i think price 11k is social high for such type of product."
