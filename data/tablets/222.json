            "This ipad is the best tablet for students. Students doesn't really need the Pro model to do daily tasks like note taking, reading, playing games, sketching and media consumption. This ipad can do all these tasks without any hick up because of its powerful A12 bionic processor.\nBattery backup is also on point. For the past 1 month I've been using this ipad with an avg. of 10hrs screen on time daily. At the end of the day 20-30% of battery still left if I start my day with full charged.\nBuy the apple pencil 1st gen. to use this ipad to its max. potential. Pencil is a must needed item for student.\nIf money isn't an issue for you then ipad pro is obviously the better choice. But if you doesn't care about pro-motion display,minimum bezel design, if you wanna save some money, then this is the ipad to go for. And if you can afford 256GB model then its better you buy the Ipad pro 2020 11inch 128gb.",
            "If you are a med student just go for it. It has a larger display than the basic iPad and a laminated display, best for reading books; also good for media consumption. With the a12 bionic chip it's Smooth AF\ud83d\ude0d . You will have a pro like experience. If you are willing to take note u have to buy an apple pencil. Camera is only downside , but having a a good camera phone who needs a camera on iPad any way. Overall I'm just loving it.",

            "Beast at it's price if u are looking into a mid range of an ipad this won't disappoint you it covers almost all good features apart from the pro motion and stuff like that but believe me the optimisation is excellent even for the 60 hz display the internals are beefy and software experience is just on another level given that it runs on Ios 13 overall as a medical student really liked the ipad it changes my experience as a whole\nbattery life is excellent as well can get you around 1 to 1 and a 1/2 day even after quite heavy usage easily overall a worthy purchase for the 64 gigs variant",

            "This is first apple device in my life. Got it in 25may 2020. Packaging was good,product is superrr. As a android guy now I can feel and understand what apple really is. Never experience before such smooth performance in my life. I bought it mainly for UPSC CSE preparation and also heard that ipads are super amazing in terms of gaming also so installed PUBGM and when for the first I opened it I laughed for 5minutes and shocked because I have never experienced such smooth and that big clear view in this game before.I feel like a newly throned KING in PubgM like no one can beat be and confidence goes up to 1000% lol.After using A12bionic in it I feel like what I have just explained(soo over powered omg).... If I write all my feelings about this ipad it will take atleast 1 hour. So I would like to ended up hear with big thank you to flipkart with so much love.",

            "This is my 1st iOS device. And believe me it\u2019s a gem in the tablet section. iPad latest 3rd generation is completely power packed device with awesome stunning display with a charismatic performance. If u planning for a basic iPad with a larger display and good performance just go for it. Thanks to Flipkart for flawless service.",
            "I have been really pleased with the overall experience of using ipad air 3rd generation. It has got an amazing screen and one hell of a great battery life as i am easily averaging about 10hrs of screen on time per charge. Add to this it has A12 bionic chip which is a very powerful processor hence, the performance is buttery smooth. If u like browsing, watching content on prime, netflix & youtube etc. and take ocassional notes you could easily replace ur laptop with ipad air 3. I would also re...\nREAD MORE",
            "I'm using this iPad for more than 15 days now with ipencil of course.. most of the my uses are educational purpose oriented so I make notes, read , underline important points etc... It's best replacement for pen and paper.. sound quality is good.. camera quality is also good and you can't expect awesome camera quality as that is not the primary feature or function of iPad.. overall its best.. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",
            "Omg i was so scared to order now in covid but it was worth ..i stay in banglore nd we are still in lockdown but still received the package safe and authentic in 5days was really happy thanks to flipkart and ekart\nWell packaged no damages\nAuthentic product ..i checked\nReally appreciate ..well little bit frustrated with battery but its ok ..its worth it",
            "Received the authentic product within day, happy with Flipkart for that.\n\nComing to device itself: Best display, battery life and no tablet can beat A12 in terms of processing. Also the audio output is loud enough and you will notice a good amount of bass. The speaker is far more superior from our mobile speakes.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind it does take 3.5hr to fully charge with provided 10W charger. Around 30% in an hour\nOne good thing is it does support Power delivery (pd) fast charging protocol (18w to 30w).\nSo if you want fast charging you will need to spend extra 6200 (4500 for apple 30w charger and 1700 for type c to lightning cable). I purchased both from apple store and charging time is reduced to almost less than half till 80%. After 80% the charging rate will go to normal mode. Within in one hour the ipad charges to 60 to 65% from zero.",
            "If you are a med student, definitely go straight away with iPad air. If you need more storage than 64gb, then go to 128gb 7th generation. But air has more better performance and display than the 7th generation. So think and buy. Just my personal opinion. The display itself is self explanatory for it's performance and cost. This is my first Apple product and I love it so much. Thank you Flipkart for this amazing product...",
            "possibly one of the best Ipad recommended if you are a Streamer who streams Games. Since you have to use 3.5mm jack i woild recommend this ipad instead on wasting your money on Ipad Pro. It does the jib absolutely fine. Touch response is great and so is Display. If you are PuBG player and you are sick of your Ipad 2018 9.7 , then this is best buy.",
            "This is my third month I am using this product. This is one of the most valuable product I have bought in 2019, though I believe IPAD pro 11 inch would be better, nonetheless this is good product if your aim is to read, surf though I have not played any game (not a game guy). I have not faced any software issues, the camera is kind of good for IPAD, the size of the IPAD is perfect it is like a book, so reading book in IPAD gives a feeling that I am actually reading a paper book. If you planning to go for lower version I would say spend little more money and get this product.",

I am very satisfied by the service and the ipad was delivered in time..\n1. This ipad Air 3rd generation 256gb is simply a beast..\n2. From a student to a professional anybody can use it for their purposes.\n3. Battery bckup is simply amazing.\n4. Display is very much like a crystal.\n5. Sound of the Ipad is very sweet.\n6.

(Please do check for some of the comparison videos. It helps us decide on which model will serve our purpose better). In short, if you are planning on buying 8th gen, you can invest a little more and go for air 3 instead. This gives you a better display (Laminated display). But if you don't have a problem with the display, 8th gen and air 3 are almost identical.\n\nI was very sceptical of ordering it online (because I have even heard stories of people receiving soaps and others instead of what they ordered lol). But anyway, the packaging was real good and everything came intact as it was suppose to be. No bends, no cracks, or any scratches. I have checked the serial number to know if incase it is a refurbished one, but no it isn't. Can't review on the battery life because it has been only a week since I had it with me but so far so good.",
