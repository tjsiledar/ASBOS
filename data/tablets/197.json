There is no marking/design given on the SIM and memory card slot as to in which direction the memory card is to be inserted. If they would have given small slip-in-tray to support sim n memory card, it would have been better as these are given in all mobile phones. No Mobile sim is supported in this device it seems.",
            "tablet display is good ,it support hd (9/10) .about battery is quit good it can stand half of day by continuous use .(7/10),.about camera quality it os not good ,it donot have even image stabilization ,which is present on other tablet of this price.(5/10).about performance it donot support pubg even in low graphic. it lag a lot .(6/10) .overall it is nice only if u need for reading and movie purouses.",

Battery on first two days wasn\u2019t satisfactory but then I used power saving options nd reduced brightness to lowest . Moreover pls use iball cable nd adapter to charge , else it won\u2019t give good result .\n\nAfter One week of use, The battery performance has actually improved. Not sure how, First two days battery draining was so worst, but now its working like a pro, battery became efficient. So ppl compaining of draining issue. Please charge using Iball adapter and cable only to 100 percent and use it for two days , then you would see battery draining improves over the time",
            "Speakers are the most disappointing part of this gadget. Very low sound. Display is good. Performance is average for the price. Build quality is good except the sim and storage card slors. Both camera are of very low quality. Would not recommend this device for people looking for good sound or camera. Overall 6/10 rating. Rating is increased only due to the price of the product as the value for money is OK.",

            "Nice tablet for price. Android os is ok. Not a lot of customisation. Performance is good. Note: I mostly use it for YouTube and movies and productivity for my learning. I do not play games. Storage is good as the memory card space can be directly combined with internal storage. Display is good. Better than a 1080p laptop. Battery is excellent. Screen on time is around 8-9 hours on full charge. Lasts for 2 days on moderate use. I use greenify to have better battery. Cases available does not feel good. The drawback is the audio. Speakers are not good . I always use earphones on this tablet and you cannot use a cheap earphones.",

            "good reliable and dependable good to watch movies and tv, worth its price. you cannot ask more for this price.",
            "This product is value for money and I\u2019ve given it a five star primarily from that point of view. Though it takes time to charge if less than 10%, however it holds charge for decent amount of time, good enough if one\u2019s away from a power source. The brightness I feel is on the higher side even when kept to a minimum. Also, the speaker sound is on the lower side. However, I\u2019ve also noticed that the volume is loud when viewing Tatasky or listening to FM. This indicates that there might be a software to hardware interface issue which if optimised will deliver higher sound. Insertion of memory card isn\u2019t a problem. It has to be done in a deliberate manner. Screen is good & delivers crisp picture. I was facing an issue all of a sudden with the powering up of the device with pressing of the power button. However, after inserting a sim card I haven\u2019t faced the problem. If one is interested in a budget tab without compromising on overall performance, then this would definitely be a good choice. And lastly, thanks Flipkart for safely delivering the product.",

            "Hi All,\n\nI am writing this review after using this tablet for a month. This tablet is a great value for money for sure because you could not get a Full HD Display with 4GB Ram at this price point. Plus this tab has Bigger battery (7000mah), 4G and Wi-Fi with good build quality(Metal back) and comes with Android Pie (9).\n\nThe cons for this tablet in my opinion is it's low powered processor(Which could handle most of apps and okay for a tablet at this price range), Double tap to wake up screen, Low speaker volume.\n\nRegards,\nTony",
            "Very well",

At 14,999 one may start having questions over the value for money aspect. Best for students, news watchers and light entertainment. Check YouTube before installing the sim card. User manual could have been better. Comes with two screen protector sheets. Get a tempered glass installed on the earliest opportunity.",
