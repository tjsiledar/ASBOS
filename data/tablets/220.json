            "I\u2019m in love with this device. I feel this is the best tablet in this price range. It is fast and does not lag at all. Some great things about this tablet that I would like to highlight are:\nIt has a massive battery (5100mAh) life. With this, I get more than 12 hours of screen time so I need to charge it only once every 2 days. Isn\u2019t it just cool?\nIt has a beautiful 8 inch screen with a good ratio which is perfect for reading books, surfing the web and gaming too. It comes along with dual speakers which makes watching movies and online series super fun\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\nIt has an 8 mp rear camera which is awesome and powerful \ud83d\udc4cI use it for taking notes and food pictures which turn out to be awesome.\nIt is powered by a 2GHz quad core processor with 2gb RAM which is very efficient and does all my work smoothly.

Simply I just need to tap the Quick panel to enjoy the native apps. Parental Control lets me monitor usage and play time so I can hand over the tablet with peace of mind. I love the camera - It is packed with 8 MP primary camera and 2 MP front camera which is also a great combination for a tablet in this range. Camera is great for video calling with my loved ones.",

It's understandable because it's processor is for entry level users only.\nIT'S NOT FOR GAMING .\nand you'll notice lags and stutters quite often.\n2) camera is below average.\nIt can just take pictures of low resolution .\n3) charging from 0-100 will take more than 2 hours easily.\n4) display is HD+ only. And the screen size is big.\nSo the image quality doesn't look sharp.\ncolours are ok . And viewing angles are good from side.\nNote : there are two variants of this device , 1) wifi only 2)wifi + 4G\nI used the wifi only version.\n\n\nconclusion : this TAB is recommended mainly for light users and for media consumption like watching moveis.\nI use this for study purpose like watching lectures.\nIT'S NOT FOR GAMING AT ALL.\nAND it'll lag often if you do some heavy task on it.\n\nBut according to the price and coming from a brand like Samsung . It's overall a decent deal.",

            "I was really excited for my new purchase from Flipkart. I ordered Samsung galaxy Tab A\n8.0, and this is an amazing product. It\u2019s so light-weight and easy to carry anywhere. And\nnow finally, I don't need to take my laptop everywhere. As far as the camera is\nconcerned, the rear packs an 8 megapixel camera. It sports a 5-megapixel camera on\nthe front for selfies. Also, we don't need to take away the charger everywhere because\nthe battery life is too good. The screen clarity is excellent. It\u2019s affordable, and doesn\u2019t\nrequire too much time to learn to use it.

It's really an amazing product. I really like it!\nSamsung Tab A 8.0 has a good screen quality and it does not lose any charge while the\nscreen is turned off. That\u2019s really good.

            "bought it for media consumption like YouTube, FB, Twitter, hotstar etc pros are - latest android os 9.0 adequate performance for basic tasks perfect screen size I.e neither too big like 10 inch ones, nor too small . good battery backup. lpddr4 ram unlike ddr3 in most tabs like honor ones . cons- ram 2 GB means not much multitasking . screen ppi is low . at least 220ppi would be nice. back is fingerprint magnet and looks dirty quickly, not big deal to many. camera is bad. overall I would rate 3.5/5 wait for new honor ones on the way",

Could have been better if it was 1080pHD.\nI use it extensively, and I am really happy with the battery!\nI love it. \u2764\nBest for students and movie lovers.\nGo for it!",

            "Nice tab under 10,000rs must buy. Battery time is around 2 days with a full charge and charging time is 6hrs. The camera is decent I just nought it for studies and loved it very much. I can do some gaming but not for PUBG lovers. BTW close your eyes and buy it.",
            "I am writing this after 2 months of online zoom classes.\nSpecs are good but it would be better if you invest some more money and buy a better tablet with a high screen resolution. This tab has really affected my eyes a lot. The display is not that good. Abviously what can you expect in this price range.\nNow I am selling it and looking for a better option.\nI am writing this from a student point of view.\nThere are many ways in which this tab has been made so affordable by cost cutting on the places where the company thinks that the users are not going to know.\nFor a comparison, let me tell you, I also have a tab A 8 inch 2017 model whose screen is a thousand times better than the new tab A which is obvious because it's price is also double.\nConclusion- make a wise decision to protect your eyes.\n:)",
            "good product. reliable brand. the camera is just normal, of course, that's not the purpose to buy a tab. the screen is decent. but glaring bit. the power back-up is huge, fantastic - that's something remarkable in this product. 8 inch size is perfect not too small nor big. fits in our palm. the audio is fine, good loudness, in headphones quality is much better. performance is at par, given the price point. good for watching movies, reading books and brief browsing. not recommended for games / multi tasking.",
            "Great product at great pricing.\nThe tablet is very light weight and easy to handle.\nMy first impression is that I can handle it with one hand without much difficulty and it\nmatches my expectations. Android 9 which is the latest version - 2gb RAM and 32gb\ninternal storage is great for me, above 5100 mah battery lasts all day and 64bit\nprocessor helps multitask very well. Gaming experience was totally awesome. I don\u2019t\nreally use the camera features but I\u2019ve clicked 2-3 photos to test it and I\u2019m pretty much\nsatisfied with the clear photos. Speaker volume and bass is very good. Lightweight\neven my 6 year old brother can handle it especially with the new Kids Mode feature in\nSamsung's One UI. It has a good design as well. Hence the overall performance of the\nproduct is awesome with such an affordable cost..",
            "Samsung A 8.0 is a amazing tablet which comes with dual speakers.I personally love this feature as it gives an amazing surround sound and can heard clearly without using headphones.The tablet is light weight so rather than carrying my laptop to college I can carry this tablet and work on it as it is easier and more convenient.It also has a great battery life,to be specific it has 5100 mah battery.Honestly,you cannot find such a battery life in any tablet especially when the price is just Rs 10,000.This by far,according to me is the best tablet in the market if you are looking to buy one.",
            "Dont expect high performance and dont install lots of apps it may slow down little bit.Very good for students for pdfs, documents viewing and especially for ebook readers its amazing. Android 9 and one ui gives nice touch to the tab but there is no theme option in this ui. If you speed up the tab a little bit install only required apps and turn on develeper mode and turn of all the animations and and set no background apps. Build quality at this price range is excellent slimmer than older version.Overall Good to buy. Carry on.",

Gaming experience is good (even though I don't prefer)\n5. camera is ok for me since I don't have much work in it\n6.

            "Samsung Galaxy Tab A 8.0 is a device designed uniquely relevant to modern era and day to day usage. It includes all those features and facilities which actually a genZ\nperson like me would like to have in his pocket. The main highlights of this tab include features like it is very-very light when compared to its manufacturing and handing which shows it is meant for all age group people. The sturdiness and look and feel of this device is also very impressive. An 8-inches screen itself shows its prime behavior when compared to wholeness and 1280x800 pixel ratio depicts clarity and saturation factor.\nIf we go deep with its inbuilt hardware components such 2 GB RAM which gives user its modulation between using applications and videos at once along with 32 GB ROM which provides access to store huge amount of media such as videos, audios, files etc.,\nBattery life is a big yes if you consider because with this giant mammoth you will also receive a giant battery of 5100 mah which protects me from missing my favorite shows and activities while traveling! Great camera features pertaining 8 MP camera giving added benefits with respect of showing my photogenic skills and to be in touch with my loved ones while video calling them. Sound mechanism is as usual very innovative because this product has dual speakers which adds salt to the dish making a song or video clip more informative.\nFinally, the main attraction of this gem is the kids mode having specific kids home screen and parental control facility which gives freedom to any parents let his/her ward learn and grow without letting their ward getting affected with any sort of ill effects of the internet content.\nAll together, this hand piece is a wonderful and effective device which actually can become a good friend of any individual helping them in their daily work life as well as\npersonal life.",

            "Tab A 8 is amazing. Battery life is long, screen is very bright, speaker is loud, apps run smoothly, nearly pure android with little bloat ware and you get all this for less than the price of a mobile phone.\n\nYes camera is bad, but people don't buy a tablet for photography.\n\nIf you're like me and is looking for a tablet to read, do some light work like replying to emails, watch Netflix and YouTube, or use it as a textbook to study, this is the best value tablet you can get.",
            "The tablet is very good and well optimized for working on 2 gb ram.used it for browsing ,YouTube and playing casuel game like angry bird and shadow fighter 2. worked well no lagging. speaker are loud enough.battery backup is good.",
            "The 2GB of RAM is sufficient for basic tasks like browsing, reading, listening to music and watching videos. If you are into heavy usage or gaming or taking great photos, look somewhere else. The 5100 mAh battery takes a while to charge, but easily lasts me for 3-4 days on moderate use. The Wi-Fi antenna in this model is strictly OK and my connection drops every once in a while for a few seconds, but nothing too concerning. The Samsung One UI interface is neither great nor awful, and most pre-installed apps can be uninstalled easily. All in all, a decent tablet at this price point.",
            "The microphone doesn\u2019t work for google duo and zoom meeting apps.

            "After using this tab more than a week I'm writing this review.\n\nPro's:\n1) The built quality looks premium.\n2) In a single charge u can watch 8 to 9 hours of video. Battery life so good.\n3) It has stereo sound quality and Dolby Atmos sound effect.\n4) It is getting software update and running in android 9. The Samsung's new one UI is simple to use and less bloatware app.\n\nCon's\n1) The display is TFT only so the viewing angles are not good and having light bleeding in display corners.\n2) The performance is worst, can't able to play good games because the processor is too old.\n3) It has slow charger in box so it takes 6 hours to charge completely.\n4) No type c only micro usb.\n\nConclusion\nThis is the best tab in this price segment and can be used only for reading and for watching movies.",

            "This is my first buy as far as the Tablets are concerned. And for the price point i'd say it was a good buy. For daily use of media consumption the tablet works fine. But I'd like to have some more basic things like at least 1080p video support, also one key point which reduced the stars is watching Prime video is a horror in this tab. The quality is bad. Also please keep in mind that - *****THIS IS NOT FOR GAMING*******",

Also it is a great tablet for reading and I can definitely say it after using this for a week. It has a good battery that typically lasts me for around a week on a single charge. If you are looking for a ebook reader and are confused whether to buy a ebook reader or a table... I can definitely say this tablet is for you. In fact it is cheaper than the ebook reader. I would surely recommend this tablet for all those who want it for reading books on the go.",
