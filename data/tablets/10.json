            "This a good tablet for the price. The display is good for media consumption and day to day usage. Colors and viewing angles are good but sometime images and texts appear bit soft. Sound quality is good and loud. The camera is average and needs improvement. The haptic feedback for typing is bad. Build quality is excellent and it feels premium. The ui is clean but it needs optimization. There is minor lag all over and though performance is good enough for daily use it doesn't feel fluid enough. In fact the hardware is quite good but moto needs to provide software update asap to fix the issues. Wish there was a physical fingerprint scanner integrated in the power button. Overall its a good buy but Motorola needs to provide regular software updates to improve the user experience.",

            "No case or protection cover is available in market for this model. Too many options are available for any tab below 10 inch screen size. Its a big drawback, and I am forced to use this only at home, that too in a room where people won't move around much.\nG70 is good otherwise.\nGood connectivity and battery life, and overall the product offers good VFM, but i am not able to exploit its full functionality due to above said reason.\nLooks premium too..\nI wish Moto could have given a simple plastic case atleast for time being",
            "This is an excellent tablet brought out by Motorola. I have used it only for a week so far but have found no lags anywhere. Display is big and nice . No bloatware in the tablet. Overall performance is satisfactory keeping in mind that it is a tablet not a smartphone.",
            "This is my detailed review....\nIt's carbon 6 carbon copy of Lenovo tab 11 the software is not optimised perfectly many applications are not working properly when tablet is placed horizontally so it is basically a mobile phone with bigger battery and display apart from that software Optimisation all others facts are good at this price point but what is if used without better software my sincere suggestion to Moto Rola is that please optimise the software I can name of few applications that needed to be optimised like hotstar Flipkart and many more and all of the above many applications did not support dark mode",
            "Great tablet\nbut a bit over price.\nThis is best for students\nAnd if you buy this to play games then you will have no problems playing games like pubg and all on this device..I am fully satisfied..\nGot disappointed at this delivery Process, too late.\nThere is no issue, great great Tablet.\nCamera is way better than other Tablets, A flash that makes it more special than others Tablet...\nYou will have a lot of features to use...\nBig screen 11 inch huge.......!",

            "Worth every penny\nNice tablet at this price range. I got it 19700/- . Calling quality, Internet speed(via JIO Sim) is very good. Motorola is slow about update, in this device last security update is oct2021. Check out for other's review for specifications and performance. I will not repeate here. You can see that I have uploaded the photo of the rear camera(tomato plant, mustard plant).\nMotorola should have provided a flip cover and screen protector, as it has given in Brazil.\nFinal verdict is you can go for it.",

I felt this was a better choice than the lenovo chrome duet as the performance is much better. The tablet is thin and the battery lasts for more than 14 hours of regular continous use. It is very hard to get accesories, either Motorola or lenovo should release accesories for it officially. Tablet mildly gets warm while gaming and this is expected. Build quality is great and the ips screen gives good vibrant colours but the PPI could have been a bit better. There is a productivity mode and can be triggered under the display timeout settings. Split screen option doesn't work unfortunately. Over all, it is a great allroundef and a great buy",

A really good quad speaker setup, Dolby Atmos does its job quite well.\n3. A snappy processor, better when compared to snapdragon 662 or the helio p22t.\n4. No bloatware.\n5. A premium body.\n6. An okay front camera for video calls.\n\nCons\n1. 64 gb internal storage, 128 which is already offered in the lenovo tab p11 would have been better, basically this is the lenovo tab p11 with a better processor and a lesser rom.\n2. I personally find the white colour of the p11 to be more premium.\n3. A lack of optimised apps for the device.\n4. A lack of official accessories for the tablet.\n5. No pre-installed screen protector, atleast a plastic film would have been nice.\n\nP.S. The covers available for lenovo tab p11 perfectly fit this model, so feel free to go for them as the variety of covers and cases offered under the name of moto tab g70 is really pathetic.\n\nOverall a really nice buy for the buck. Decent for gaming, attending meetings, watching lectures, one could even use this as an e-book reader with an anti glare screen protector.\nHappy buying if you decide to go for it. :)",
