            "Excellent tablet for professional use. I am a software engineer and I am using it extensively. The best feature is the task bar like windows using which you can easily switch the apps in just few click. Excellent performance and doesn't get stuck. Battery life and sound clarity is very good with Dolby sound mixer. More than I expected.",
            "using this tablet for nearly a month now it is an truly exceptional experience in an Android world. the resolution is awesome for watching movies, playing games, reading E-books, working on Microsoft office apps etc. I have played games such Asphalt 8, Real racing 3, Badland 2, NFS Most Wanted, Dead Trigger 2, Modern Combat 5, Moto GP all of this excellent gaming titles run very smoothly. talking of apps Whatsapp, UTS, My Jio, Jio voice and all other jio related apps works very smooth. you just have to download it from a proper external source to make it work in tablet and yes i have installed jio sim and it works really smooth for Video calling, VOLTE calling and even same for whatsapp.talking about battery life for heavy usage it gives an complete whole day and for normal usage it could go up to 2 days easily. also and external adapter supports this tablet if you want to project your presentations on a projector. last if you need proper accessories for it buy it from AliExpress it is really worth it till the time it is not available in Indian market. it is an dream tablet for me which solves all of my purposes and its really worth it compare to an ipad because of the open source market in Android.",
            "A decent tablet, started using since a week. The best part is the battery life which the charge long lasts for 1.2 days, the camera is not that good which is lower than the mid range mobiles, the GPU given can play HD games smoothly but still found some lags during the play is Asphalt, Assassins Creed, Nova 3 and Spider-Man 2. The 3gb RAM and 2ghz processor makes the tablet run efficiently but still if found time taking by adobe reader when opening large pdf files (1.5aec), coming to the external surface which is very smooth, easily finger prints can be seen on the backside of the tablet, the display is above average even though they mention it as an IPS display-when watching 1080p movies you can only experience 80% of the HD viewing as the display is not up to the mark, the buttons on the side which are volume and power look ok but are not steadily fixed can feel moving when we touch, gets heated up when playing HD games or charging, the charger cable doesnt fit firmly into the charging port you can experience the cable loosening even its inserted into the port, the touch sensitivity is good, overall its an average tablet , it should have been priced at 20k.\nBetter go for iPad at 29k if your choice is excellent display and good camera.",

Battery backup is great\nBut one thing I am thinking about, the Lenovo active pen. Does it work with this tab ? If anybody tried please let me know. Thanks in advance.",
            "Excellent Product...light..slim and fast...I bought the 16 GB one..it is too good.. got a 64gb sdcard..with that I changed the internal storage from 16 to 64gb... haven't tried WhatsApp or imo...sound is just awesome...plus camera is good in good light condition...I could have buy the apple ipad but Lenovo didn't disappoint me...cause I bought my lappy lenovo y500 in 2013...it is still running smoothly without problem... definitely a good buy and the seller didn't disappoint me too...happy with it",
            "ITS SOO GOOD!\nI was confused whether to purchase this or the IPad for 22800.\nI'm glad I went for this.\nThe processor is blazing fast and 3GB RAM is good enough for decent multitasking.\nThe screen is good quality can play videos at 1080p.\nI wanted the 64GB ROM variant, but that was out of stock. I added a SD Card so storage is fine.\nCamera is grainy, not that I plan to use it much.\nFingerprint sensor is fast and accurate but nothing compared to smartphones.\nIt's ultra light and very thin.\nA good purchase.",
            "Excellent value for money and very good product design. Even though it's said it's LTE the tab has no native dailer and VoLTE is not provisioned. The hardware has capability hence Lenovo need to give an update to support Jio SIM. Jio SIM is only allowing internet. Hence no unlimited voice without Jio4Gvoice calling app.",
            "Delivered within 2 days by flipkart.\n\nFor the price, the specs are good but not extraordinary.\n\nRecently I also came to know that Lenovo will not be providing upgrade to Oreo or Pie for this model, so hopefully at least they open source kernel sources so that someone might make some custom ROMs for this model. Other than that, can't complain. Good tab. Good sound output. Bright & legible screen. Camera is average - but clear enough for video calls. I got the LTE model - please note you can't use this for phone call as the tab does not have VOLTE so you have to use some app like Jio4G voice (i got a jio sim).\n\nIf buying a bundle on flipkart - Tab + case + tempered glass - please be careful as the tempered glass I got suggested and bought in the bundle is for Lenovo Tab 4 10 not Tab 4 10 PLUS (this model). I had to raise a case and convince flipkart for return of tempered glass but they accepted and refunded after return of tempered glass.\n\nOverall good purchase. However, I suggest going for different models in this price point if available especially considering OS updates are now over and no Oreo or Pie update.",

The only thing I found negative is the tab was sleek and very slippery. So we can't operate freely however with a proper case and cover we can do operate without slipping..\nCalling feature if available is a little helpful but I never mind. The product is as per description.\n\nGo for it. It's worth the deal",
            "I'm a big fan of Lenovo products since I brought a CPU built in desktop years back and never gave me any problems. The screen is lovely and it's so so so sleek. I brought this for my daughter and she's just in love with this. However one feedback is that I put a JIO sim card in this however u can't call without downloading a VOLTE app since JIO needs a VOLTE enabled phone or tablet which this does not have. That's all. Otherwise it's a great buy.",
            "When such devices are not available in stores for experiencing and then making a decision to buy, the online only buying should have an option of buying, experiencing the device and then allow to exchange to a difference device at least in case the expected performance is not there on such devices. I was not able to use this device due to no compatible keyboard sold by Lenovo in INdia and wanted to return it, but FLipkart or Lenovo dont have such options. Not worth buying with such bindings being unliberal. This is where Indian online portals sucks compared to US or Europe where you can sent back the device if performance is not up to the mark.",
            "Don't buy it from flipkart, Go for amazon. You can't return this product here.\n\nAbout product:\n1. Good for gaming.\n2. Display is not full HD but they claim it.\n3. No sharp display.\n4. Better go for apple Ipad 2018 for better display.\n5. Sometimes it lags while browsing or accessing files.\n7. I mistakenly ordered this. I was looking for tab4 8 plus.\n8. No customer support.\n9. Sound is just ok.",
            "Excellent product. I did not expect it would be so thin. I'm glad. Not a lot of bloatware. Just the standard Google and Microsoft apps and also Lenovo's own. Dolby Atmos is really nice. I was considering purchasing some portable speakers for this but after testing the speakers, the sound is loud and crisp and I don't think I need any. Also the fingerprint sensor is really responsive and fast. Unlocks screen in no time at all.\nScreen resolution and brightness is excellent. Battery life so far is good. Keyboard swipe is great. Swiping as I write this review (although the predictive text could be better). Hardware-wise, it's good for its price. No complaints whatsoever. Even the camera is surprisingly good for a tablet. If anybody is looking to purchase a tablet in this price segment then do consider this.",
            "One the best tablet .\nPros.....\n\nbattery backup is good\nVoice Call through Jio app ,Voice clarity and mic performance is very good\nSome apps r not compatible but installed through apk file and working fine but can't be updated through play store we have to again update through apk file\nGood display\nInternet speed is good with Jio\nGreat for watching videos\n\nCons...\n16gb internal storage is a big drawback....go for 64gb version if possible",

            "pros:\nGood display\nSnapdragon 625 processor\nPosition of speakers and sound quality is decent.\nBest alternative for i pad(2018).\nBuilt quality is good\nLooks great.\nCons:\nInternal storage should have been 32 GB for 3Gb ram model.\nSlightly at a higher price though there is no alternative with these processor.\nNo fast charging support.\nFingerprint scanner is only a scanner would have been better if it was Integrated with navigation functionality.\nVerdict:\nIf you need an android tablet with decent functionality and good display go for it.",

            "Works great. Screen is bright and a pleasure to use. Works with jio sim as well for people who are wondering. Also this is better than the 8 inch version as it has a bigger screen and a bigger battery. The battery lasts for around 2 days with normal usage.\n\nAlso it is a value for money tablet.",
            "The tap is amazing ant arrived before time the built quality is premium sound quality is good lag of bass but still ok the touch is sensitive but the IPS FHD display might get better at 30k the operating system is good and no issue in speed and no lag for regular usage. Fingerprint sensor is sensitive but cant use as a back button might get improved the accessories are yet to come in india just waiting over all its good tablet in todays market under 30k. Specially good if u are gifting to other or specially parents not for high tech use with multitasking.",
            "The tab makes lot of sense for me as I use it mostly for reading and watching movies. I'm not a gamer at all. Display is good and Netflix gives u a wow experience. The sound quality is pretty satisfying. The camera quality is not that satisfactory and could have been much better. Fingerprint scanner is not appropriately placed. Should have been on the side panel to accept the pointing finger's image instead of the thumb. Nevertheless it's over all a nice to have machine.",
            "One of the best tablet with stunning performance available, got all the best available features. I especially liked the multiple account profiles and ease of switching using fingerprint sensor + the excellent battery backup + kids profile pre-installed apps. The only improvement I expect from Lenovo is that they keep this tablet in par with the latest Android versions time to time. Otherwise pull the plugs for this model.",
            "Tablet is decent for the price. Doesn't have fast charging. I use it mainly for streaming shows and movies so performance is OK. Battery lasts approx a day doing that. Don't game on it so can't comment on it. Useful for work like outlook and excel. The bloatware causes it to lag and those default apps and loaders can't be removed. I have tried it to no avail. the biggest challenge with this is that finding accessories for this tab is difficult. Even if you are willing to pay 4k to 10k for a good cases, it is non existent for this model cause iPads dominate the market. but for those who want an Android tablet, this is your best bet. I bought an additional memory card for storing stuff so memory isn't a problem. wish someone would launch a pure Android tablet with 64 GB with 6 or 8 GB RAM. But given what is available in the market this is your best bet.",
            "decent in size and glass back finish looks so stylish and premium.9/10 look.\nNo lag while using many Apps and playing games. 10/10 performance.\nFingerprint is rectangular shape it works fast and responsive but m not a fan of it.",
            "It's a wonderful tab with beautiful finish. All the apps are working fine. 4 GB RAM makes it very fast as well as 64 GB space is sufficient. Processor is also good. Only thing that resolution should be a little more at par with Yoga Tab3 Pro to make it real perfect as we are paying Rs. 30000/-. Also lenevo should provide compatible bluetooth keyboard and headphone as accessory to make it awesome.\nAnyhow the product is really very good and worth buying.",
            "Good mid-range tablet with decent hardware and stock Android.\n\nDisplay - LCD IPS display similar to what is found on Lenovo mobiles like K8 Plus. Not as bright or vibrant as AMOLED but perfectly adequate for reading and watching videos. Good contrast and color reproduction. Screen is very sharp if you hold at normal distance. Pixellation is noticeable only if you hold it close to your eyes.\n\nPerformance - Good mid-range CPU. 3GB RAM is enough for everyday use. 4GB version will be better if you play heavy games. I didn't notice any lags with the games I played. RAM management is also good since this is stock Android.\n\nScrolling lag - There is a noticeable slowness while scrolling through web pages and in apps. Some people may find it frustrating if they are used to quicker scrolling, but the device is still usable and it will not be a major issue for most people.\n\nUpdate 2-Aug-19 - Lenovo stopped providing updates for the tablet 4 months after releasing it. Never buy Lenovo tablets. Official version is stuck on Android 7.1.1. Luckily there is unofficial version of Lineage OS 16 available (Android 9). This runs perfectly and has zero issues.\nSearch on Google for \"LineageOS 16.0 for Lenovo Tab 4 10 Plus by yener90\"",
