Battery is decent, Not so good nor Bad.\n5. 4G sim working is a good addition + SD card support, as 32/64 GB variant are not enough for storage. so good it has SD Support up to 256 GB\n\nCons :\n1. Very old Android 8.0.0\n2. Even EMUI is 8.0 too old where has new devices are ready with EMUI 10...\n3. Stylus Pen is good addition but lags a bit and has no dedicated In built software for it. Need to install 3rd party apps. But overall a good feature.\n4. \"NO DESKTOP MODE\", I contacted the Huawei and asked how to enable Desktop Mode, They Replied for Indian Version Tablet is not compatible for desktop mode, But International version does, I don't know if an Update could enable it.\n5.

            "Ordered this one for my kids, it comes with a pen. Which is very nice and Kids are enjoying it. sone pre-installed apps for kids where to they can do some painting and stuff using pen. I have setup this one with Google kids account which let you control he tab from your phone. Screen clarity is very good, Sound quality is fabulous with the harman kardon speakers and it will give 10 out of 10 for the speaker quality, camera could have been more better. Even though it says fast charging, the charging takes hours to reach 100%. Still I would recommend you too buy this one and with this configuration this would the best price option.",
            "its a great product in this price.. Fast and Good Performance with Good Battery Backup.",
            "Its a pretty good tablet\nGood for media consumption\nOnly compromise is the software, still on Android 8 and emui 8. No hope of getting any update in future too.\nM pen is just fine",

Battery performance is also good. After a full charge I was able to use it for 2 days 14 hours with 18% battery remaining, my usage includes 10 hours of Youtube over WiFi, 4 hours of notes reading and 1 hour of leisure activities like updating and all. Tablet receives all the latest android app updates from play store, so you can easily use all the Google services without any hustle and bustle. Although you will not get any software update from Google but security patch is updated regularly with a lag of few months. Currently its running on August 2020 patch. Android is 8.0. EMUI updates will be delivered on time. Stylus works perfectly fine with no lag as such. Stylus is light and easy to handle but if you'll compare it with apple pencil obviously you'll feel the difference. It's a complete package in 20k range.",
            "Nice value for money tablet in the budget. stylus support is a very useful feature for me. just started working with it simply loving the experience...",
            "I am reviewing it after more than one month of use. I have listed the pros and cons bellow\nPros:\n1. The sound output from 4 stereo speaker is just amazing, it can even beat a budget Bluetooth speaker.\n2. Battery life is excellent as it has a 7500 mAh battery\n3. Built quality is also impressive as it has full aluminum body\n4. Screen brightness is very good and auto brightness works good. overall screen quality is good\n5. For reading and media consumption it is perfect\n6. I use it with M pen lite and it works perfectly\n7. As I don't play games, can't say about heavy games but for normal uses, light video and audio editing it works perfect.\n\nCons:\n1. The volume and lock key are not perfectly fitted so it feels like loose.(may be for my device only)\n2. Does not support volte. (only 4G internet can be connected, 3G calling is available)\n3. 3.5mm jack is at left bottom corner, it should be at middle or some what above that because with my cover, I could not use earphone so I have to modify the cover (may not be a problem for other covers)\n5. It is very slippery and heavy so cover is needed otherwise it may fall.\n6. M pen lite should be included along with it in same price.\n\nMore over it is a great product in the price range.",
            "I got this tab on offer for 18400/- , Packing and delivery is good.\n\nCons:\n\nScreen have some uniformity issues, one side it is very bright other side have some screen burning issues. Flipkart will not accept these things as an issue while selling, but in exchange they will say screen has burning issues and can't be taken it.\n\nAlso screen quality is not upto mark as Full HD\n\nDon't expect much from camera, It is like a 2MP\n\nSeems sound is not effective from down speakers\n\nSpeaker grill at bottom side is good, but upside is very sharp and can scratch fingers\n\nSuggestions:\n\nSpeakers are louder, but can be provided side speakers bit more louder instead of Harman brand for a tablet\n\nAlso instead of stylus, could have provided good display and slightly better camera.\n\nThen this would be the best tablet in this segment",
            "I was looking for a stylus supporting tab in 10 inch catagory with descent processing power based on android. After much research i found this product.\n1. Processing is decent\n2. display and touch is flawless\n3. Camera is below average but that is insignificant feature for a tab\n4. Stylus performance is very good\n\nOverall good package in this price for android.\nStylus is provided with tab don't worry",
            "Bought this tablet for internet browsing and my documentation tasks.\nPros-\n1) Big clear display.\n2) Huge 7500mah battery which gives me great screen on time of 10 to 12 hours on moderate use.\n3) USB type C port.\n4) Stylus pen works nicely.\n5) 4g sim card slot available at this price.\n6) one of the best tablet under 25k budget.\n...\nCons-\n1) The biggest con of this tablet is a poor camera. 8mp is equivalent to 2 mp camera quality. Definitely 2mp is batter.\n2) No VoLTE support as of now till july 2020 which means you can't use jio sim with calling, stuck with data only.\n3) No screen protection and no back cover with it. You have to buy covers at very high price like 1000 1500 more.\n\nOverall this is a nice tablet in this price.\nHope this information is helpful to you.\nThanks.",
            "If your looking for a basic laptop for working ms office and stream some YouTube or netflix well you can switch your preference to this tablet as it can do all of it.\nespecially considering the price of 21,000\nyour getting a 10 inch full hd display.\n7000+ mah battery\nslim abd elegant\neasy to carry around plus it has a sim card and sd card slot\nit even has support for a stylus. but not included in the package.",
            "Pros : Screen, Battery, Processing, Build quality, pricing.\nCons : Design of tab is in landscape mode which makes it a bit unusual to use especially with a cover on. Cameras are average like any other tab. EMUI is good and well optimised but it's a personal choice if you like it.",
            "The only thing I will say is that it's best in this price range and perfect for students as it has free stylus pen and it's stylus support and free M Pen and big battery and 4 speakers makes it different from other tablet and much helpful for students.\nThe only thing that I don't liked is it's OS 8 and mainly it's made in China.So think before buying.I bought it before this India china conflictand can't return also, otherwise I may have returned it.\nHope you understand what I want to say.",
            "Pros:\n1) Great sound you can feel the pump as 4 speakers blast (in landscape mode) as well as while gaming you don't cover them so its a good experience\n2) 1080p display\n3) Stylus which works decent\n4) Upgrade storage by SD card (I got 128gb card and now its smooth)\n\nCons:\n1) 1080p is fine but software like VLC and MX Player run jaggy if x265 format is played as the processor is old as well\n2) Stylus lags and has no buttons on it like other Huawei Active Pens which is handy as a controller\n3) Android 8 has glitchy support with some apps like Spotify which was constantly sticking by switching from portrait to landscape mode on its own. Software updates are required to fix these issues.\n\nHave paired it with a logitech k480 keyboard and 128gb samsung evo class 3 sd card. If you are looking for lenovo d330 alternative, this feels premium but the lack of software update might be concerning if things start to break drastically after Android R becomes stable amd support for Oreo would be reduced.\n\nNo Desktop mode so that's a buzzkill.",
            "FIRST OF ALL THANS TO SUPER FAST DELIVERY .. I GOT IT IN 2 DAYS THAN MENTIONED DELIVERY DATE ( 6 DAYS ).\n\nTAB IS JUST AWESOME, I WAS REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE STYLUS BUT IT WAS PRESENT IN THE BOX.\nAND THE STYLUS IS ALSO AWESOME BATTERY TYPE.

            "Great product with excellent delivery!! In between lockdown I never expected before time delivery - it was delivered one day ahead!! Big thanks to Ekart for their continuous good service. The product is simply awesome - you will definitely like its features, display and smooth operation. Not used much yet but picture, sound and touchscreen quality all are just great!! Camera is weak but sufficiently good pictures in lighted areas. Look wise it is sleek and smart - overall loved the product!! Can go for it without any doubt if you are looking for something for office work, studies, teaching or, simply gaming!! Stylus yet to use - hope it will also perform good. Thank you Flipkart!",
            "I bought this for study purpose. Great purchase. Nice and super responsive stylus pen and the audio is awesome. No use of buying extra Bluetooth speaker. Now I can reduce my physical book storing space. I love this one. Don't go for expensive Apple product when you get everything thing here. Only one thing missing in this tablet from Apple product is just the expensive logo the rest all same, who cares about Apple iOS.",
            "camera is average. NOT for photography purpose. for video call also it's looks poor compare to phone camera clarity.\n\nstylus pen not supplied along with tab. disappointed. but we can purchase from flipkart separately.\n\nHUEWAI keyboard not available. hence we need to purchase from other third parties. if HUEWAI keyboard support provided it will worth for us.\n\nbattery capacity found excellent. for average use we can expect last long for a day in single charge\n\nprocessor found Ok for this budget compared to lenova and other tablet where still they are using SD450 EQUIVALENT PROCESSOR. in this tab, Kirin 659 found good but if they provided Kirin 710 or 960 it will be better.\n\nkids section found good",
            "I received the tablet without the stylus as well. The main reason for buying this tablet is the stylus support and the bundled package, or I could've gone for mediapad t5 or samsung tab a 10.1. Flipkart has assured a resolution by Saturday. So will give an update then. The tablet itself is great for the price. The screen is good, the sound with quad speakers is excellent. Build quality is good but the volume rockers and power button are a bit flimsy. The battery life is surprisingly good for a tablet. There are no decent cover cases either for this product. Would still recommend if it comes with a stylus as originally assured, otherwise there are much better and cheaper alternatives. Edit: Got a mail and SMS from Flipkart assuring the stylus and a gift card would be given by Oct 25. Have received the gift card, awaiting the link for stylus. Will update on receiving the same. EDIT: Received the stylus as assured . Works like a charm! Good work by Flipkart keepingup its word. But the entire scenario could've been avoided to begin with!",
            "Everything is top notch..\n- performance wise a decent one.\n- battery wise it's superb monster.\n- sound quality, oh my godamnn.. it's beyond words. U will feel like u are listening on a flagship level sound speaker. Heavenly beautiful.\n- Display is a good IPS one. Wil definately enjoy the multimedia experience.\n\nOne small thing I didn't like is that.. there is scarcity of good quality covers n tempered glass for this model. U will not find any accessories for this in the offline market..other than that..m highly satisfied with the purchase.",
            "Fantastic product. Value for money. Awesome specifications. Consistently out of stock. Flipkart should arrange more stocks. I bought it on the recommendation of a close friend and I have been recommending the same to my friends. But sadly the product is out of stock.",
            "It is a very nice product.\nBattery back up is nice 8 h and more\nDisplay is more comfort for children's\nCamera is also good\nHotspot easily joint , wifi , 4 g also\nVery slim ...\nValue is loudly..\nOver all good...\nValue for money....",
            "Very good tablet for media uses like watching movies, reading eBook, gaming, little bit drawing also, overall the best budget tablet I can say. You must be having trouble in choosing between iPad 2017 and this but if you are not professional and will not going to use this for note taking, save your money and go for huawei mediapad. Stylus is good but it can't be compared with apple pencil, considering the price.",
            "Such a valuable tablet with so good specifications at so reasonable price.\nHighly recommended to all",
            "The pen works really well. If you don't have budget for iPad or galaxy tab s6 lite then I would suggest you to go for Huawei mediapad m5 lite. This is the best budget tablet that offers a native pen which writes quite well. The palm rejection is quite well and doesn't have any issue till now. The only cons is the processor which is a bit slower than the other tablet at this price range like galaxy tab a7. If you are a student and willing to do online classes and take notes with this tab you can definitely go for it. But if you want gaming and video streaming then you might go for some other available in the market like galaxy tab a7. This is a review given by use of one day testing all its features. Hope it would help you \ud83d\udc4d",
            "This tablet is what you call value for money. The big advantage of this tablet is its multimedia experience (both display and sound) and huge battery. If you're looking for a tablet under 20k with sophisticated balance of performance, then it will be perfect choice for you. Kid's corner is also an interesting feature in it. This tablet is basically built for kids and students.",
            "Good price Good display Good Battery.... Some time lag... And hanging.... But this price range tab is very good....... Samsung A7 TFT display not IPS diplay compare to sam A7 and Huawei m5 lite this tab great... Diplay is awsome it playing 8k videos and 2k resolution diplay quality awsome....",
            "I am writing review after 15days of using. I can say that its good in this price range compare to samsung or apple. Camera is average. Battery backup is good. Stylus works smoothly and fast.\nYou can see the attachments. Huawei has to upgrade Android system from 8 to 9.",
            "One of the best tablets in market. I would say this is the best one. Go for it and you will see real value for money. The display and speakers are just fabulous",
            "Thanks Flipkart for 1 day prior delivery. Product is real value for money.\nSound quality is amazing. Calling works fine with Jio with location service ON. But I took little time to research it. Basic manual could have helped here.\nBattery life is awesome.",
            "Best android tablet in this price range, excellent battery backup, amazing display and sound, good performance except for a lag while playing heavy games. Suitable for studies and multimedia, the only issue is with the os, still operating on Android 8.",
            "Overall Perfect buy \u263a\ufe0f in this price.\nNice Display, speakers, battery, front camera...\nStylus works fine for normal use.\nPerformance is good for normal use(around 2 gb RAM free).",
            "Finally getting my hands on the tablet is really engrossing. Had to reorder it since the first time was cancelled by the seller for reasons unknown. Value for the price. Have to wait for the M pen which Flipkart had assured will be available at a later date to fully use the tablet's potential. So far so good. Received the re.1 coupon for the M pen and placed the order today i e 26th of October as promised by Flipkart.",
            "Compare this tab to iPad air with pen support, and the pen comes in the box..\nThough older android version, the usability is perfect.\nChoose 4G-64G model if budget allows, it functions real smooth for day to day use (docs/browsing/media)\nHas premium finish, unexpected high sound quality - this will surprise you for media consumption.\nThe landscape mode home button camera may seem un-natural in beginning, but are great for video calling as well as many other apps.\nAccessories for the pad are available on other online stores. The variety may be limited, but you can find well fitting once easily.\nBattery life is very good. Because of big screen, compare this to a 4000mah battery phone. Lasts thorough the day mostly with continuous use.\n\nIt's a great tablet for media consumption, video calling and occasional document work.",
            "This is really the Ipad killer. The performance is amazing The looks are u class apart. Huawei has put handwriting mode for every text box which enhances productivity to another level I use the stylus for taking notes and it does the job pretty well.\nIf you are looking for a really pafomant tab, and I dont believe in lugging my laptop everywhere, this is a very serious contender\nFew cons:\nLack of accessories\nThis pad should be the number 1 product of Huawei, but the reseller did a stupid job of.the delivery and so ratings went bad\n\nTHE TABLET IS GOOD PERIOD. The stylus is key to fully utilize it (and can be bought separately\nGood screen guards comes should be available\nPros\nSound is amazing\nHardly any lag\n\nAmazing screen quality\nHandwriting software by Huawei is game Changer(I wrote this entire review using the M pen(and my handwriting is not particularly good but everything went pretty smooth)\n\nUse. it for studying, notes, its a productivity enhancer. I will use for a few more days and give a long user review",
            "Missing AMOLED Display here.( lesser Brightness) colour are faint but video quality is good. Few lags. Stylus (slightly heavy) and finger print sensor- wonderful and very fast. Wrong place of power on and volume buttons. Poor camera quality. No face unlock. Kirin is good but pure android tab works better. Its older android version 8.0.\nBattery backup good but charging time 4 hr.\nSound quality is good not the best as described.\n\nBought in aug2020 @ 23k.",
            "Nice product.. Go for it... Average camera quality... Quad speakers enhances the audio quality..stylus works awesome.. But I would mention that it takes time to get fully charged but charging durability is good... As well as I will like to say that in opinion for accessories.. I don't think great bcoz when I searched for its flip cover I could not search the exact model number as well as size... So I will rate 4 out of 5..",
            "A very good product. It feels premium. I felt it bit heavy. Only one problem is no good flipcover available, though its trivial. M pen is absolutely beautiful to use. Performance is excellent as 4 gb is better.",
            "I brought it during sale for 16700/- including HDFC offer and brought Huawei pen separately.\n\nPros:\n1. Battery: The battery life is really good. Charging 7000mAh completely takes around 4-6hours based on the quick charger. Once it is charged, you can easily expect it for 1day for massive usage ( I repeat massive).\n\n2. Display: watching Netflix, prime, hotstar, youtube.... are really good. The display is good.\n\n3. Huawei Pen: That's a good add on. You can right notes easily or do basic surfing with the pen, when you're in a Starbucks. You get little attention from people around you for using it.\n\n4. 4G Connectivity: This is also a good feature, you can have dedicated sim and use data through it instead of using hotspot from your mobile.\n\n5. Design: initially it looks odd to have landscape orientation but believe me you will get habituated to it and the tab itself is so slim and light weight for its construction.\n\n6. Fingerprint Scanner: it's very fast and quick.\n\n7. Speakers: It has total four speakers and they are really loud and clear. Moreover the speakers are made by Harman Kardon, they are once of the leading companies in Automotive division. They sound similar to google home mini.\n\nCons:\n1. Cameras: both the cameras are good for Skype and video calls but don't expect any advance features you see in smartphones. It's an average camera.\n\n2. Charging Time: Though it supports 18w fast charging, it takes 4hours minimum to charge it's huge battery.",
            "It is excellent tab it supports all apps including google apps also. Camera also very Good.Sound also excellent. Great battery . Very slim tab. We can see in this tab Watts app,calling,zoom meeting, all futures are excellent.",
            "Here is my DETAILED and GENUINE REVIEW of Huwaei Mediapad M5 Lite after using it for nearly 10 days.\n*DISPLAY: Display is really awesome and too bright. Watching web series and any YouTube videos at 1080p is really enjoyable. The auto-brightness works well and also touch response is great. Under 20k price ,overall display is outstanding(Multimedia and entertainment king).\n*BUILD and DESIGN:Full metallic body and looks premium. But remember it's slippery, so better to use cover.\n*PERFORMANCE:Performance is Ok, no lag issue found till now. But remember Kirin 659 is not for heavy gaming. I am using this tab for my study purpose and I am fully satisfied . Split screen works fine and multi tasking is also great in 4GB RAM option. RAM management is descent.\n*SPEAKER :Wow, the speakers are powered by Harmon Kardon and these sounds really great. Music listening in this tablet is fun and enjoyable.\n*M-PEN: M-pen stylus works fine. Sometimes it lags but what Huwaei provides under this price no other tablet provides any stylus support. Note taking is OK.\n*CAMERA: Camera is average and also tablets are not for photography purpose. Online classes, video calling, documents scanning is overall great in this tablet.\n*BATTERY : Outstanding and nice battery backup . 7500mAh battery performs great.\n*SOFTWARE And ANDROID 8: This is the only downside of this tablet if you consider its old Android 8 version. But for me, there is no problem with Android 8 and google services works fine . But it will be better if Huwaei upgrade its Android version to Android 9 pie or Android 10 in future.\nNOTE: This tablet is highly recommended for students and note taking is overall great. This tablet is not for gaming purpose.\nSo, under the pricing of 20K , it is the best option available in market.",

This Tab checks all the boxes.\nAnd of course the Stylus which is cherry on top. \ud83d\udc4c\n\nThat\u2019s all in an affordable budget if you compare to other Tablets \u270c\ufe0f\u270c\ufe0f\n\nThe only negative point is Android update not being available (For its own reasons) due to which apps like YouTube at times couldn\u2019t display videos etc.\n\nBarring that, it\u2019s a good bargain at this price.",

The Harmon Kardon Quad Speakers setup is quite decent and Loud enough to fulfill the requirement of you and your room space.\n3. 4GB RAM and 64GB of ROM, enough to handle your daily tasks.\n4.

For storing videos and pics, you use a SD card.\n- Performance/Gaming - Not meant for gaming. PubG runs on low graphics mode.\n- Camera - is good for video calling but not for video recording.\n\nNote:\nFor customers who brought during big billion days but didn't received the stylus, they can buy the stylus from flipkart website (search huawei-m-pen-lite-stylus) at Rs 1",

The other alternatives were Samsung Galaxy S6 lite (25,000 at that time, now 31,000, including pen) and Apple tablet (you have to pay extra for pen which is 8000). I am mostly using this for taking notes, more than that, for taking classes to students. I write on the tablet which is instantly shared by share screen option in Google Meet or Zoom. At this price range, this is the best tablet with note taking capability. If you do not want a pen-tablet, there are other options. Again, the build quality is good, sound is superb!.

            "Just awesome.\n\nI had an apple ipad 3 for quite some time. My biggest grouse with Apple was that they stop support for devices after some years for newer generation of iOS. Although it happens on android too, but, Android devices are not that expensive.\n\nComing from an apple ipad 3, this tablet seemed way faster.\n\nScreen: Screen is decent but not smooth. I use a OnePlus 7T (on 90Hz), and I feel the transitions leave a trail which irritates sometimes. Otherwise, the tab has a bright screen which is sufficient for most tasks on a daily basis. Glare is quite evident and some improvement could be done by Huawei in this department.\n\n\nActive Pen: Works beautifully. Blocks unwanted touches to a large degree and works with low latency. Feels quite premium.\n\nCamera: not very good but you won't buy a tablet for its camera. If a camera is your priority, look elsewhere.\n\nBattery: Superb. Lasts over a day of excessive usage.\n\nPerformance: Good for a tablet in this price range. Did not have trouble handling multitasking. Ram seems to be enough at 4GB. Processor could be better.\n\nStorage: came with 64 GB, and is expandable. Decent speeds.\n\nWifi/BT: good\n\nPricing: Got it for under 18k in BBD sale. Seems to be rightly priced with an active pen. Huawei could include a cover for protection.\n\nShould you buy it?\nBlame Steve jobs for making us want tablets. However, if your needs are to watch movies/series on a bigger screen vs mobile, do document editing, casual art etc, this is a good device for you. If you want a performance oriented tab, look at Samsung S6/S7.",

            "I tried the tab however did not tried for gaming however everything all is perfect... Styles too works perfect.. I did not experienced any lag with styles and works perfect.",
            "Overall good device\n1. Note-taking :- I am writing this review using M-pen(provided in package) and the text recognition is also fair enough. Use Inkredible app for note taking, which works flawlessly. It' s built in app, nebo, which is also good but has unnecessary restrictions while drawing something directly over page. Squid doesn't work well. Bamboo paper works average on it.\n2. Video playback and Sound :- Gorgeous display with good colours. Plays 1080P, 60 FPS like a Charm. supports max, upto 1440p . Lacks 4k playback. Audio quality is more than enough for you unless you are fond of music with various low and high beats. Low beats are mostly suppressed by speaker, so not so pleasing at that time.\n3. Smoothness of UI:- Smooth for medium usage. Lags for a second or two while switching between tabs in chrome. Other things work very well like navigating across various apps, multi-window feature.\n4. Gaming :- Stuck at Iow graphics in COD mobile. PUBG-minor frame drops at balanced graphics & medium frame rate. Asphault-8 > Stuck at High graphics and playable frame rates, graphics are excellent. Asphault 9 works a bit smoother on default visual settings and plays smoothly most of the time.\n5. Battery Life :- Good enough for long day use. Has 18W charging rate although bundled charger has a Maximum rating of 40W.\nI got it at rupees 17529 On big billion days using SBI credit card.\n\nOverall serves it's purpose well. 8/10 from my side because of its outdated processor, not so fluent gaming and a bit of lag under medium to heavy usage like playing FHD videos in any website and simultaneously doing some work in other window.\nIn built screen recorder, app locker, file vault, eye comfort display and fingerprint sensor are really useful.\nIt has Android 8 and no further updates for it, but Android 10 is also not any special. This tab gets August 2020 Security Patch which is very good.\n\nBut note that, no other tab available in this price range offer you a good gaming. Samsung Tab A7 is same for gaming, COD mobile works ultra smooth on high settings but all other games lag. Galaxy tab S6 lite is not so good for gaming but S-pen is better than M-Pen.\n\nWarning: - Never use any tempered glass if you want to enjoy the stylus sensitivity as intended.\n\nA good and a bad news for you :- After using tablet, your mobile may feel too small and not so pleasing to you, it happened for me, but what a mobile does no other device can.\n\nBuy it if you want a cost-effective, entry-level note-taking tablet as it's built for that.\nFor pure note-taking, drawing and graphic designing, nothing can substitute Ipad Air/Pro with Paper-like screen protector, even expensive android tablets like galaxy tab S7/S7+ comes with compromise in this particular aspect.\n\nSo, go for it...",

Don't expect anything much from this device. If yiu have slightly more money then definitely go for Samsung s6 lite or ipad 8 gen. These will give you more options.

Is not made for gaming\nWhile studying, u feel stylus weight is more than normal ( mau be coz if am using frist time or i use light weight pens )\n.....\nBenift-\nLoudy spkrs\nBrighter screen\nBattry optimization is awsm\nDave saver is best feature in this tab\nSplit screen works perfect\n...\nConclusion-\nBest for study purpse, don't buy it for gaming, or heavy work.\nDo not worry about security update or Android update... If u want this for study purpse.. doesn't matter what OS is..",
            "Very nice tablet.. Smooth performance",
            "I bought 3/32 version in 14,399/- after using SBI card discount. If you don't have use for too much space, 3/32 will work great as you get around 21GB free space and around 2.3GB free memory.\n\nOthers have already mentioned most of the features but a couple of them which went unnoticed are as follows:\n\n1. It has a WiFi bridge option. It means that you can connect to one wifi and share that same wifi as hotspot simultaneously. It's really handy feature to extend wifi range.\n\n2. It can also charge your phone as act as powerbank using appropriate cable (didn't try but there is one option when you connect the usb cable)\n\n3. Huawei HiSuite is the perfect software to manage tab - backup/restore and OS management; e.g. recovery. I had to use VPN to download it. Maybe the site is blocked. Benefits of HiSuite\na - It provides a feature to allow to connect HiSuite enabling USB debugging and this has vast impacts. It makes your tab ultra safe. Even if someone gets access to your tab, OS can't be flashed if USB debugging is enabled which will render it useless for thieves too!\nb - You can backup almost everything (yeah no need to backup to Google just keep it locally) - including system settings, apps WITH DATA. No need to root to make backups. Even if you have to root you can make backup and restore everything.\n\n4. The charger supports 10W, 18W and 40W fast charging! I don't know how much the tab supports but this charger can be used with perhaps the newest fast charging phones.\n\n5. Battery is super awesome and the OS is very much optimized. I got approx 20 hrs screen time with mostly PDF (Xodo software) and Onenote - stylus. I had used wifi for around 2-3 hrs in totality, SIM for around 10 minutes only (just to test) and was on power saving mode for the whole time. Xodo has this feature to keep screen on which I enabled.\n\nThis is the best OS I've come across. I rooted my old phone because it lacked some basic features but this tablet OS is bundled with all of them with some additional features as well - navigation gestures (fingerprint and on screen with that circle kind of icon), rotation to 90, 180, 270 degrees, Speed meter on status bar, Wifi bridge, Power On/Off schedule, Option to backup apps with data and the best which I didn't even think of - Using HiSuite without enabling USB debugging.\n\nThose who are not happy with Android 8, guys new android versions rarely have something for the end customers. Mostly those are for developers who get new API and developer tools. So, except a few features like Desktop mode, those are more or less useless.\n\nOnly con is that the MPen is not perfect. It sometimes misses taps which is acceptable. After 4-5 days, now MPen seems to write better. Maybe I took time to get used to it. The taps are still not flawless and small parts of the strokes are missed too (rare, though) but I watched on a video that even apple pencil tend to behave like that.\n\nFor those who need this to study, this is absolutely bliss in Android and in this price segment. Getting it for 14,400/- (on BBD) is in my opinion, a very good price considering 4/64 GB phones with around 6inch screen phones are available for around 9K. Still, this tab can very well be considered worth 18K. Can't say above that is just or not.",

            "Good product.",
            "Great value for money\n\nPros:\n1. 2.5D display. It\u2019s gives a feel very premium feel.\n2. Aluminium back.\n3. Quad speakers. 4 speakers that gives a 3D effect to your audio. They aren\u2019t very loud but definitely loud enough to be heard throughout the room.\n4. M-pen lite. I\u2019ve always felt stylus wasn\u2019t needed for a media device but this changed my perspective. It\u2019s super smooth. Lags a tad when you take notes but it\u2019s not frustrating or deal breaker.\n5. Battery backup. Battery standby on battery saver mode is great. Can easily use it for 2 days on moderate usage. But even otherwise the battery backup is appreciable.\n6. Support application. This is a unique application which provides all information regarding your tablet. It also provides the cost of components and services charges for replacement. I found this really helpful.\n\nCons:\n1. No update. This is the single largest con of this device. It\u2019s confirmed by one of Huawei\u2019s developer on an official forum that there is no plans to update this device. We MAY eventually get HarmonyOS update but that\u2019s doubtful too.\n2. No dark mode. The screen is super bright and I wish there was a dark mode. But since there\u2019s no Android 10 hence no dark mode.\n3. No desktop mode. Again this is a limitation of the operating system. No android 10 hence no desktop mode.\n4. Extremely glossy screen. It\u2019s such a throw off to be honest. I\u2019m also unable to find an anti-gloss/ matte screen guard to counter this.\n\nCompromises:\n1. The screen is of standard quality that you get in this price range. They are just decent. No AMOLED hence the contrast isn\u2019t great and the screen isn\u2019t saturated. Pixel density is also average. Since it\u2019s an IPS LCD screen the screen feels too bright/white. Considering the price tag this is impossible to provide.\n2. M-pen lite is good but it doesn\u2019t have a button to perform any task. The screen recognises the stylus when it\u2019s in close proximity but due to a lack of button no actions can be performed. Having a button would likely require it to have Bluetooth. This would bring in the additional burden of requiring a charging infrastructure for the stylus.\n3. Could have had slightly better processor. Honor tab T5 has Kirin 710 while this has Kirin 659. Having the same processor here would have been a great addition.\n4. No 4G VoLTE. You can use 4G internet without problem. You can also make calls on JioCall app via internet if you are a Jio user but otherwise you are left hanging. I personally never use call features on a tablet. I\u2019m not sure if VoLTE is a software or a hardware feature enhancement over 4G but either way you are doomed if this is a necessity for your lifestyle.\n5. Slightly on the heavy side. This is also a standard weight for tablets of 10 inch. It feels heavy and really uncomfortable while using the tablet lying on your back.\n\nVerdict:\nHaving used it for sometime now I\u2019d recommend this for media consumption. Be it watching video, reading or listening to audio. Decent features along with stylus and aggressive pricing makes this a must buy. If you are confused between this and Samsung A7 I\u2019d recommend Huawei mediapad M5 lite as this hands down beats it in almost every segment. The only exception being receiving further updates. This is one of the better tablets that you can buy at this price range. With discounts and bank offers you will easily be able to buy this tablet at much lower than it\u2019s quoted price. Overall I\u2019m mightily impressed with this tablet and hope you will too.\nPlease upvote if you find this review helpful.",

            "This tablet is amazing with a very high battery backup and FHD display, although only drawback is that it won't be getting android 9 or above. But FHD dusplay 7500mAh battery and stylus for 10 inch tab in just Rs 14800 is an amazing deal and worth it",

            "It's a budget tab that fullfill most of your needs. It has google support for most of the service as it is running on android 8 which is not going to be updated in future. The added advantage is stylus support. The functionality of style is a bit limited. You can use stylus for taking notes in limited app. Bus there is no skin support for stylus like samsung which lets you write any time on your screen whether you are on main window or browsing web or taking screen shot. The functionality of stylus is limited as UI is not as refined as samsung.",

Good battery performance, easily last one day even after heavy usage.\n\n4. Type-C Fast charger, feels like brick \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\udcaa but looks premium.\n\n5. Quad speakers are loud and clear.\n\n6. With 10.1 inch Full HD display, quad speaker and powerful battery, this device is highly recommended for watching hd video content and online classes.\n\n7. 4G supported sim card with call support feature make this device very useful for independent usage of internet and calling.\n\n8. Now a days minimum 64GB internal storage is must, also it has option to extend storage upto 256GB via external sd card.\n\n9. Normally we get stylus only in premium budget tablets but here the case is not same.\n\n10. Fingerprint sensor is also quite fast.\n\n11. With 4GB Ram and Kirin 659 you can play normal games with ease but better don't go for high end games as this tablet is not for high end gamers.\n\n12. Some small but useful feature like Eye comfort/Night mode, children corner, screen mirroring, wifi sharing, inbuilt app locker, power saver mode, cleaner and antivirus powered by avast, GPS, notification light, phone clone.\n\n\nCons:\n1. No android version update, but i don't feel that's a complete con because OS updates is one of the major reason that makes the tab's performance slow. So this con can actually help this tablet perform better in longer run.\n\n2. No face unlock but have good fingerprint sensor so this con is also not a problem.\n\n3. Camera is just ok, It feel only like 5MP not 8MP. Good only for video calls purpose.",

            "- Display quality : Good Display Panel, Good indoor brightness, Eye safe filter is good and does its job. No strain.\n- Battery Life : Best battery Life among Tablets, 7500mah battery also works great with this huge display.\nNormal usage gives you around 2 day battery life. Heavy usage with games and Video calls/Calling can give you 1 full day life.\n- Gaming: Not for high end gaming, Like PUBG and COD it will struggle if you force to put the game on medium settings. And can easily play at low settings.\n\nYou can play low tier games like subways surfers, temple run, and other low gpu demanding games flawlessly.\n- Ram Mngt. It will give you about 2.5GB ram for your apps which id enough to run apps smoothly and a good multitasking.\n- Pen support: pen is great at touch response, and also palm rejection while writing is perfect. (Recommended: use inbuilt apps for notes and writing).\nPen battery last for about 6 month and use AAAA cell which will cost about Rs250.\n-100% charged battery:Video Streaming on amazom prime video_ 2. 5 hours movies leaves tablet with about 82%\n-100% charged battery : YouTube stream for 2 hour leaves about 85%\n-Security : Fingerprint work super fast and looks secure.\nApp Lock is available.\nLockscreen is simple/sleek looks grt.\n-Screen Recording: Available with external audio recording.\n\nCons noted:\nSystem update isn't available frequently.\nCurrently its running on android 8.0 amd till now there's no update. Not sure it'll receive Android 9 update in future.\nDefault home Launcher is not that good for advanced user.\nChrome browser takes up battery.\nRecommended use any other Internet Browser. Like Firefox, Samsung Internet or Duck duck go. Low end CPU for gaming.\n\n\nRecommended For people:\nFor Entertainment: Back to back movies playback without charging.\nMusic: great sound quality. Stereo sound is good.\nFor low gamers: It can run other gmes smoothly like GTA Vice city and Sanandreas, Talking tom, Runners and other low end game.\nWork from home people:\nIts good for online task and for documents editing, note making, easy writing.\nIts perfect at this price for Multimedia Playback. Battery life is great for non stop video and music play for hours long.\n\nNot recommended for:\nPhotographer : camera quality is fine as per tablet cemera and at this price but not that good for high professional photos.\n\nHigh Gamers: if you want it for PUBG or COD and other high end games than forget about it as its CPU/GPU is not good for playing games at even medium settings. PUBG is only playable at low graphics and about 15-20fps.",

Totally happy with the product.\nThe stylus is exclusive for this tab and doesn't work on my android mobile. Moreover if I click the text box with fingers then keyboard appears but if the touch it with the stylus then handwriting pad appears which automatically generated texts.
