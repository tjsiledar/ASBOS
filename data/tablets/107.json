If you looking out for only watching videos and attending zoom calls this performs well.\n4. Speaker is good.\n5. Battery wise I can say Average backup but at this price range, we cannot expect more.\n6. 4g SIM inclusion is great\n\nCons:-\n1. Observed too much of LAG\n2. Google assistance is not all working.\n3. When the tab is connected to Speaker for every 10 to 15 min it will disconnect and automatically reconnect.\n4. Observed heating problem.\n\n\nFinally, if you are looking out to buy this product I will say if you want this tab only for videos watching and zoom calls go for it.",
