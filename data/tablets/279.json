            "Sometimes, size does matter. Lenovo\u2019s new goliath. the Phab 2, is a smartphone with a screen that can put most of its category counterparts to shame. Besides the large screen, you also get a metal build and a host of other awesome features.\n\nTaking a closer look at the device, the first thing that you will notice is the large display. The Lenovo Phab 2 sports a colossal 6.4-inch HD display. The large size is great for those who love watching a lot of videos, or playing graphic-heavy games.\n\nJust above the display is the earpiece, front camera and sensors. The phone sports a 5MP front-facing camera. So for all you selfie lovers, the Lenovo Phab 2 can deliver.\n\nAt the bottom of the phone you\u2019ll find the speakers and a standard micro USB port. The Lenovo Phab 2 comes with Dolby Atmos audio enhancements. This combined with the large display, make the phone perfect for watching videos.\n\nAt the back of the phone is the 13MP primary camera. Like the phone\u2019s elder brother, the Phab 2 Plus, you get an AR mode. With this turned on, you will be able to add a cat, puppy, fairy, or even a dragon to any picture. That\u2019s not all, you can also interact with the virtual creatures and play with them.\n\n\nWhat\u2019s the point of having a large display if you can\u2019t spend hours watching videos on it. The Lenovo Phab 2 comes with a 4050mAh battery, which should be enough to last you all through the day.",
            "For the last 3 days I m using this mobile,excellent sound quality real Dolby atmos feeling,camera is not so bad, it's average,fast charging not possible with the given charger,display quality is good,battery also good,display size is really excellent wih this price,overall I m extremely satisfied with this product, thanks to flipkart for quicker delivery, the delivery person also very active,and done a wonderful job....",
            "I love flipkart because I feel very good with my new mobile lenovo phab 2 @budget price.I see the image of my phone by app I little impressed after received by new mobile I opened my with huge happiness.thank-you flipkart",
            "I got this product delivered to me 5 day of ordering it, The only good part is the screen its large & the sound quality is decent, Not that great.\n\nMajor Problem :\n1) If you try to speak with the loudspeaker the opp person cannot hear you as your mouth piece does not work well\n2) Put of your loudspeaker & get back to handset , now your mouthpiece will not work at all - Got to reboot the mobile\n3) Listing to music via headphones, A call pops in.. you pull out the ear phones & the mouth piece does not work - Reboot the mobile\n4) Phone on charging ..A cal comes in..remove the phone from charge mouth piece does not work - Reboot the mobile.\n\n\nPlease request you all to keep away from this phone, Good for nothing it is.",
            "Editing this after a superbb stress usage after 1.5 months or so..\n\nwith so many thing s in mind went for the OTA update and trust me the phone seems superbbb 4g aiirtel is running like a mad speed and its awesomely col while charged up and low battery issues solved.\n\nGo for it at this price you will not need any other phone\n\nI am an avid MI user and practically I feel no phone can match to the hardware and software tuning that an MI device gives. bee using a MI note, note 3, note 4 and also possess an MI Max9the big daddy).\n\nthis is an honest review after 3 weeks of intense usage.\nI will go straight to the specs.\nDont think anything about the processing power, its mindblowing .A massive 3 GB RAM, MediaTek (MTK 8735) quad-core processor, the Lenovo Phab 2 takes your smartphone experience to the next level for sure.\nAlthough my redmi note 3 still uses 3gb ram what I have found is the ram left after using the same number of apps on both, the phab 2 still has approx 1.72gb of ram free whereas the Redmi note 3 has only 1.2 to 1.5gb free which is a remarkable spec considering the display size is massively huge in Lenovo Phab 2.\nTheres no lag in the apps and the the smartphone works butter smooth.theres no heating issue at all even with the phone being on charge for a long time. The redmi note 3 has ample amount of heating issue. The ram the storage is more than enough and u can slide a massive 128gb micro sd card to expand beyond the normal level.\nNow comes the most important part the display.\n\nGuys remember this is a sub 10k range phone so dont expect this to have a brilliant display like samsung or infinity display type stuff. Saying that I just loved this display at 65-70% brightness and a great Airtel 4g connection, HD videos on youtube are a treat to watch. the display is crisp, colors ae good and the screen melts into the bezel so effeortlessly that you wont need a tv or a larger monitor once u a re habituated with this device. Chats and scrolling fb , twitter are so easy with the big display. Also needs to be mentioned is the touch responsiveness which is simply awesome, the touch reponse is so good u can actually somehow use the device with one hand although its big for one hand usage.\nI guess the back side is removable which is a great thing considering the massive battery and the heat dissipitation once can expect from a device.\nOnly one small issue I felt was the lack of enough battery for a heavy usage user like me for the entire day but who cares till you have a MI or ROMOSS power bank with you. the battery lasts for one complete day with oderate to heavy usage and remember by usage i am meaning Airtel 4g usage. streaming, whatsapp, fb continously with almost 2hrs of talktime daily and 2 hrs of music almost thats a great battery but if it would have been 5000mah it was awesome. 4050mah is descent and does justice.\ntheres no fingerprint scanner but doenst matter much as this is a budget phablet.\nThe smartphone is 4g enabled and it always receive 4g for sure. the secondary sim is a 2g one.\n\ntheres no call block facility in lenovo so I have installed the Zen Asus UI dialer for the same, now its a complete mean machine.\n\nLaslty the Dolby ATMOS my goodness the sound effect surpasses the reproduction quality of my 5000rs pioneer car stereo impact. Audio quality is a tricky stuff as i am weariing a spec so cannot put the phone so big on the ears but with earphones the audio s awesome voice call clarity is simply superb.\n\nratings:\nBattery :7.5/10\nDisplay : 8/10\nprocessor and Ram: 8/10\nBudget: 9.5/10\nquality of the hardware/ device build: 8/10\nperformance : 8/10\n\nOverall at this price point with such a huge display and look and feel, the gunmetal grey Lenovo Phab 2 is a great must buy product.\n\nLenovo Phab 2 overall rating 8/10.",
            "Good Value for money, duel 4G at 10k, its combination of Tab and Phone, works well for my requirement, comes handy when travelling. if you are looking for Full tablet exp, its not suitable as its just little 1in bigger Samsung Galaxy Note but same dimension, not similar to full iPAD or Full tablet screen resolution. Screen quality is good but could have been better.\noverall build is good but back cover is all gold coloured plastic material, if you press it littler hard you will get lose feel. there are no good Phab with Android 6.0 in this price range\n\nPros :\n3GB & 32GB RAM\nFast, battery life, i use 3-4 hours a day while travelling and battery last 2 days\nAndroid 6.0\nSD card support\n\nCons :\nStock Android experience, not customised, so for all features you need to download APP compared to MIUI.\nBack of tablet is plastic\nScreen quality is little better\nNo premium case available, all the case are for Phab 2 Plus, which has camera and finger print sensor position at centre not usable on Phab 2.",
            "Got the product today. Seems to be good. Battery looks stable. Voice while calling fades (it's an issue). A bit big while calling but extremely good for Internet usage. altogether it was a good buy for 7999/-. Moreover I was better benefited with the exchange. Hope no companies or shops are giving reasonable rates compared to flipkart. I hope it's a better buy wrt 4000mah battery , 6.4\" screen, 7999 pricing.",
            "I am purchasing last couple of days .\nVery good condition and price is good overall good . especially battery backup and camera quality is good.\nThank you.\nVery good condition mobile\nI am suggesting now\nYou really purchasing this Lenovo phab 2.i am Purchasing Two mobile's o e for me an another for my brother...\nAwesome mobile and overall good...",
            "The monster wat a mob in tis segment I bought it in BBD for 7k it's really helpful to watch movies ,utube videos,hearing music in Dolby Atmos it's audio quality is damn awesome.Video recording is very good it cancels the unwanted audios and gives perfect clear sound by Dolby Atmos audio thanks for Lenovo.Eventhough it is 225gm it's feeling like not as much weight u can buy mobiwin case for tat.And battery is also good for tis entertainment beast.If you need only this requirements u can surely check out tis product.Hope tis review helps you.Thank you !!!",

Audio quality is a tricky stuff as i am weariing a spec so cannot put the phone so big on the ears but with earphones the audio s awesome voice call clarity is simply superb.\n\nratings:\nBattery :7.5/10\nDisplay : 8/10\nprocessor and Ram: 8/10\nBudget: 9.5/10\nquality of the hardware/ device build: 8/10\nperformance : 8/10\n\nOverall at this price point with such a huge display and look and feel, the gunmetal grey Lenovo Phab 2 is a great must buy product.\n\nLenovo Phab 2 overall rating 8/10.",

Camera is not up to the mark. No 13 Megapixel. Very poor picture clarity. Even Lenovo A1000 which is a basic Android phone has good clarity camera. This Phab 2 is Very slow in video streaming at fast internet connection. Slow in downloading. It shows that processor is not sufficient.... Only thing is it has Dolby Atmos...

            "It has been a month since I have been using this device and here are my takes on the Lenovo Phab 2.\n\nPros:\n\n1. Sturdy built quality. Feels pretty premium in the hands contemplated by a sleek design.\n\n2. Screen size is precise and appropriate and justifies its name of a phablet. It can be user with one hand, while it is big enough for sufficing your media cravings.\n\n3. Device is pretty fast (considering the legacy of tabs). Lenovos decision to eliminate graphic transitions in return for a better performance is commendable here.\n\n4. Camera quality is decent. Daytime pictures are OK types; however low performance is not up to the mark.\n\n5. Display is crisp enough. Viewing angles are decent for the price range.\n\n6. The presence of a notification LED is appreciable from my side.\n\nHaving said that, lets have a look at its downsides.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Battery - Perhaps its biggest disadvantage here. In spite of sporting a 4050 mAh battery, it drains out within 18 hours ( with average usage). Additionally, battery drains considerably fast even when kept idle.\n\nThis may be the case only with my device; however I would like some insights from others here as well.\n\n2. Lenovo promises DOLBY AUDIO here. However both headphone and speaker sounds are not up to the mark.\n\nMark my words; the sound is not bad at all. In fact its pretty impressive. However considering my experiences with Moto in the past and an Apple now, the Lenovo seems to be lagging behind a bit.\n\nHowever, all things mentioned, the price point must also be taken into consideration.\n\nOther than this, the device performs pertty well and is a perfect choice for individuals looking for a budget large screen device for their daily online tasks. Overall a GOOD BUY.",

You don't need additional speakers for listening in a room.\n3) The rear camera quality is super. The macro photography is simply awesome.\n4) The front camera comes with a feature of selfie and group selfie. The front camera quality is good.\n5) Viewing photos and videos is a good experience on this phone. You don't need a tab to view it.\n6) It comes with a 5000 MAH battery which is long lasting. But if you are viewing videos continuously, the battery gets discharged quickly as it is a big screen phone.\n7) Call quality is loud and clear including Reliance Jio calls.\n\nCons:\n1) The phone does not have fast charging. It takes about 6 hours to get full charged. You have to keep it overnight.\n2) Front camera does not have flash.\n3) There is no dedicated memory card slot. You can use it either as dual SIM or with one SIM and a memory card.\n4) The phone is a bit heavy. It does not fit in pocket properly.

I've got a wonderful battery backup, lasts for 30-36 hrs with heavy usage like 4G Data and live streaming.Camera is excellent. Audio recording and playback is supported by Dolby Digital. 3GB of RAM makes the phone run smooth, and is capable of running number of apps at a time. All the features are excellent. Device is installed with Android 6.0 and the perfect phone for those who like gaming in big screens and watch HD movies. Please don't buy for normal usage, because the phone is slightly heavy and very big to hold. Two hands are completely required for operating this. If needed for better performance with optimal resolution, then do not buy this phone. If one has enough money to enjoy gaming, watch HD movies and experience something BIGGG, then this phone is for them. I had a desire to buy MI Max, since it is unavailable I made a choice of Lenovo Phab 2. Design of the handset, accessories are good and well packed. Phone has dual speakers that gives enhanced audio and the earphones sounds good. Dolby Digital audio output will take you out of this world and speakers in the earphone do not vibrate with increased volume.

Although it has got a high camera mp count, in reality the quality is similar to 5mp.\nBattery longevity is definitely good but also not so great.\nVideo quality and music quality is absolutely amazing. It has got a really high audio power and that is a plus point of this cell phone. the screen is really big and one can easily read through newspapers without difficulty.\nThe internal memory space is great. you really don't require any separate SD card for that.\nOverall, the quality is good, the display is great, the external feature is amazing, camera is not much great and i like the product even though i don't love the product as much. I am using this cell phone for 1 and half years and i don't absolutely love it, although it is fine for me.",

I did start using it from 6th Feb 2018.\n\n\n\nWhen I started using this phone, It was okay, But after one month. The charging function was not working properly, it revealed that phone had connected with charger as usual. But, actually it was not connected with charger and battery was going to about to die.\n\n\n\nWhen I disconnected the charger from phone, it always showed that phone was getting charge.\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t know why its happing with my phone. After all I had visited nearby my place service center of Lenovo care. It is \u201cNet Dot Solution in Tilak Nagar, Delhi-110018\u201d on 10th Mar 2018 at 10AM,\n\nHere I had discussed with Preet Singh. Who was associated over there for Lenovo tablet care department at that time. I described all the details to Preet Singh and he told me that right now I could not help you. Because sir \u201cLenovo software was not working properly. So, he suggested to me, that I had to visit to another service center for the service. After that I came to my place with upset mind.\n\n\n\nBut, somehow I did switch off the phone and on it. then I found that unfortunately my phone was working .\n\n\n\nThere after I did use it another 20 days. And now I am facing the same problem. And yesterday 5th Apr \u201918, I have already visited the same Service center and I got the news that \u201cNet Dot Solution in Tilak Nagar, Delhi-110018\u201d. Has been closed for tablet service care. Indeed it\u2019s a bad sign for the customers.\n\n\n\nNow, here I am seeking the service at \u201cNet Dot Solution in Tilak Nagar, Delhi-110018\u201d for My tablet. Or else change my phone.\n\n\n\nPlease take a look seriously and let me know you input.",

Even though you search for lenovo phab 2 covers most of the results will be for phab 2 plus or phab 2 pro. Screen is good, sound is ok, battery meh, handling requires practice.

I first bought vibe k5 series and the phone is working nicely.\n\nWith the offer from Flipkart, I bought Phab2 provided the features we would never at this price. I would like to pinpoint the following basic features of the phone:\n\n1. Batteries: Lenovo claims the batter would work for one day and it does. I run 3g all the day (being a trader!) and then too battery discharge is only 45% by 4:30 pm.\n\n2. Screen size: Big screen is so good for a phone\n\n3. Dolby speakers: You will never find such a fine quality dolby sound in a phone. it is a great experience to watch movie, listen radio, etc on the phone.\n\n4. Noise cancelling earphones: They provide this with the phone and phew! they are amazing earphones\n\n5. Fast battery charger: My 4100mAmp battery gets charged within an hour from 20% to 100%.\n6. Touch, RAM and Internal memory works finely with some additional settings and features.\n\nCons for some will be the size and weight of the phone.

Its not preloaded with so many apps, that's fine for me. 6.4 inch screen looks good that's why I bought it but I felt weight is more so for day to day use, it becomes a bit uncomfortable but again I'm okay with it. You can't handle it with one hand due to big screen. For camera whatever it is, I'm fine with it.\n\nOverall, for this price and these features, phone is good not saying so good because\n1) it doesn't have gorilla glass protection so be ready to spend more money on getting tempered glass\n2) As I belong to Xiaomi users, I found so many features are missing but that's a completely different story as Xiaomi is famous for its features with less price. I'd still say I like Xiaomi when it comes to its features.\n3) Bottom menu buttons. Lenovo has changed them. For right-handed user its quite hard to press back button as back button position is changed. looking for any option so I can change functionality of menu buttons.\n(menu buttons have back light that's good)\n\nFor only 3rd point I don't like this mobile but rest things are good and if you are planning to buy it, you can buy. I don't have any complain to make as of now.\nI'd still prefer to go with Mi Max but now I can't but you guys can. It doesn't mean this phone is bad or something its just with Xiaomi, you'll have so many features.\n\nOne last thing - this mobile price is 11,999. Phab2 plus and Mi Max 14,999.\nYou exactly can't compare this mobile with Mi Max as you have Lenovo Phab 2 plus to compare with it. So for this price, this phone is good and no other phone is available to compare with it.",

            "I bought this product very recently (it has not been a month yet). I got it in pristine condition and it works just great. Gaming, reading using apps all are good but since last couple of days it is showing some problems with the battery and the mic. The problem at first was that the phab immediately after showing 24% charge (within seconds, not minutes) it turned on battery saver and showed that the charge left was 15% and just after that it shut down. When I plugged it in, it showed me the battery was empty and within 2-3 minutes it showed 13% charge is done. This happened thrice in last two days. And the other problem is that sometimes when taking a call I can hear the caller but the person on the other end seems to be not receiving any audio from my end. The problem with the mic is solved by rebooting but this one occurs more often than the other one. By the way before anything else I must say that all the apps running are from google play store only and most of them are supported by google. This phone is really good in terms of working, reading, browsing and even gaming. If these issue had not come up I would not have written this review instead just would have given the product 4 stars this much good of a product this is in terms of performance.\nAfter using it for 3 months without getting it to the service centre it's working pretty good and all the problems have been sorted out automatically and damn this phab is making my life hell lot of easier.

Even a mobile that is lesser in price and model, has the strongest glass. Battery drains of very quickly. My Nokia mobile even with low battery, I can run for few hours. Really frustrated with this Lenovo's product. I recommend Flipkart to take this product from their display so that people are not cheated with Lenovo.

Even the phones with the price tag of half the price (Redmi 3S) of this has better processor. This is worst processor you would get in any mobile phone.\n3. Camera is complete useless, too much noise in the picture. Felt like it has the camera which mobile phones used to have 5 years back.\n4. Speakers are also very bad, it sounds worse than old Radio.\n5. They have said it has Dolby Atmos sounds. But I could notice nothing like that. You can't blame my headphones because it is \"Audio Technica ATH-M50x\", the best headphones for mobile devices.\n\nPros:\n1. Battery backup is somewhat good. But the reason for this is because it has very poor display resolution and very low processor. Only because of this it can provide somewhat considerable battery life.\n2. You can use SD card or additional storage.\n\nSo I beg u plz don't go for this device. You will feel cheated.",

Got a call from call center to verify my request, after I told about the problem and the steps I had tried to resolve, I was asked all kind of stupid questions on whether I inserted the SIM in proper way...if it was the correct SIM format... whether I really performed those troubleshooting steps and wanted me to explain those in detail.\nNext thing, they wanted to send a technician home to verify my claims. The replacement request was accepted only after the technician confirmed the same problem. The whole process took 2 weeks.\nLuckily, I had a backup phone at home...otherwise I would have been left without a phone for 2 weeks :-(.

            "1. The person at the other end of the call isn't able to hear me once I disconnect the earphone/headset. Reconnecting the headset isn't helping. Issue isn't sorted even after rebooting the phone. The other party is able to hear me on calls only after multiple reboots or a factory reset. The only other way to counter this problem is to use a VOIP service (WhatsApp/Skype) to make and answer calls. Then the headset doesn't seem to cause this issue. I have tested 14 headsets and earphones and faced this issue with each and every one of them.\n2. When I try to share or upload a file from the Downloads folder or any other folder I get an error message that reads \"screen overlay detected\" and I'm prompted to turn this off in the settings subsection of the apps settings. However, when I visit the apps settings I see nothing that pertains to screen overlay. So I try to switch off the \"Draw over other apps\" setting for each app one by one which is a tedious and irritating process. But this doesn't sort the problem.\n3. The phone offers 2 choices: format memory card as internal memory and use memory card as external memory without formatting. When used as external, the phone stores apps to internal. When the memory card is formatted as internal, the phone combines internal and external memory. But on restarting the phone the app icons are lost and I have to open them from the Play store. So I'm forced to use the memory card as external memory instead of formatting it as internal and thus getting increased space for app storage.\n\nVerdict: the hardware of this phone seems to be just about ok but the software is riddled with glitches that the updates aren't taking care of. I never expected this from a brand like Lenovo and I feel like an utter fool.",

This problem persisted even after update.\n2. Camera is ok. Front camera is bit disappointing.\n3. Even if battery is 4050 mAh; if u use it continuously, it hardly lasts 24 hrs.

            "Worst Mobile I ever See in my life....\n\n--> video quality is very poor, Getting blurred.\n--> Both the camera quality is worst, Images are getting blurred\n--> The battery will get dry within a very short period of time (2 - 3 hours max).\n\n\nAS I was not satisfied with the mobile I have raised refund request, so in the first attempt, Flipkart had arranged the verification call on Sunday 16th at 8:00 PM but I didn't receive a call from them, Later on when I checked on Flipkart site they rescheduled the call for 18th at 2 PM.\n\nHowever, at the same time I already had an another planned appointment, so on the 18th morning I called Flipkart customer care to reschedule, but they denied by commenting that some issue is going on in the system. As per schedule, I got a call at 2 PM sharp, but as I already in the meeting I requested to reschedule a call after half an hour, But eventually I didn't get any call back from Flipkart so I called them again and they refused to refund and keep on repeating that they do not have any refund policy for mobile phones.\n\nSo I requested a customer executive to transfer my call to the next level so he tried to connect me with the available senior guy, but no luck, even I waited for 5 minutes on the call, so I requested him to arrange a call back with senior but he denied and ask me to call because Flipkart does not have any call back process in such cases.\nWhen I called Lenovo technical support I came to know that these are genuine issues with the product so Flipkart has to give the refund and they can send back all such products back to the company, It was already reported with Lenovo and they are working on it to resolve. In addition same has already been clarified by Flipkart technical person but they even not bother to that.\n\nOn contrary Flipkart is not ready to refund as they do not have a refund policy for mobile phones, so now I do not understand because of Flipkart internal policy issue I am getting suffered and ultimately if nothing will happen I will have to use the product with the limitations.\n\nThrough this long story I want to highlight that the reputed online shopping company Flipkart is not bothered at all about customer satisfaction after you purchased and they got the money, even they defined their processes and guidelines in such a way that the customer should not reach their senior members",

            "I went for this phone for big screen and memory. Got it below 10K in Christmas Flipkart offers. So far I am happy with the phone. There are few software and hardware problem though.\nFirst is I was not getting notification from hike messenger. Found that in settings - accessibility hike is off. Even though I turn it on, it gets off every time I clear the running instance of hike messenger from memory/close the app. As a workaround I kept hike messenger running in background by clicking the lock key which shows during checking currently running apps.\nThe phone's speaker is superbly placed at both side of the charging point. Hence it gives awesome sound even when I lay the phone back on a surface. Unfortunately out of the two speaker slots, one doesn't work, not sure it's a fault or internally there is no speaker behind the left slot, can't remove back panel/battery so cannot check. But the right speaker itself is capable enough to rock your party.\nThe battery is superb. Overall having a good experience so far, but sooner or later have to visit service centre to check out the speaker issue. Hopefully the software issues will be resolved by Lenovo through software upgrades.",

But one thing looks inherent with all devices is that the mic quality is too bad, especially when you use it hands-free or speaker mode. The other person (receiver) hears too low or with disturbance. This is not only true to phab2 but also for p1 vibe and K4. This I am saying this because I used all these three.\n\nNow Flipkart donot want to replace it and dilly-dally by saying their technician will visit and there will be conflicts of time with everyone. He checks and tells the mic is bad and says this will be replaced. The guy who replaces is one more guy who comes another day. Now this guy will not replace even if there is a slight scratch.
