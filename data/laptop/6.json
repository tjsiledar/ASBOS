            "Here is my review on this laptop after using for 2 weeks.\n\nI've heard that this laptop heats up really quickly, but I didn't felt any thing like that. This laptop never reaches more than 10 degrees above my room temperature, even after I game on it for 4 hours. This can run mostly all games on high setting with 60 fps. I personally have tried 2 games on it valorant and apex legends both runs on high setting with 60 fps. And even this gives me 60 fps with high settings while recording in Valorant.\n\nMy usage:-\n1. Gaming\n2. Programming\n3. Studying\n4. Entertainment\nAnd this laptop fulfill all my needs.\n\nOverall this is a really good laptop in this price range. Go for it.",
            "Good Product, I am satisfied all of the features, except battery life, It is very awesome product, wheather have a little bits of improvement in battery life time.",
            "Posting this review after 8 days of use\nPros: Value for money\nGraphics card can handle some good application\nand softwares and games( far cry 5, batman Arkham\nKnight) gonna install more after couple of days.\nDisplay is good\nKeyboard is good\nBattery life is also good as of yet \ud83d\ude05\n\nCons: Gets heated up really quick while gaming plus\nreal hot \ud83d\udd25\nSpeaker is average\nOverall in this price segment this laptop is beast.....\nWill post an update after 1month of use.....",
            "Performance is good as I expect in this price segment they giving intel i5 10gen with 4gb nvidia 1650 there are no issue with normal use like surfing web and it can handle some heavy application like matlab etc it's good for coding etc. If you are a heavy gamer this will not satisfy you but it suits for entry level and lite gamers. Worst battery back up it stands for 2 hours in normal usage and in heavy usage it will stands max 1 hours. But it's a value for money laptop and in this price segment there are some laptops like hp pavilion gaming but this laptop is far better than that because of the ssd it will boot under 9seconds so go for it but consider some cons I have mentioned.",
            "Amazing laptop. It has a premium and professional look with powerful hardware. Sound is a bit low but I bought external speakers for that so no problem. Everything else about the laptop easily makes up for that. Thanks alot Flipkart for the fast and safe delivery",
            "Bought it for 49990 in Big Billion Days.\nThis is best laptop in 50k.\nI5 10th gen. Gtx 1650\nBoots in just 7sec.\nBeast performance. Thermals are awesome. It doesn't heats too much in heavy tasks [plugged in charger]\nBattery backup is good if used in low power mode[around 6hr] [3 to 4 hr in best performance mode].\nI bought it for coding and it performs really well.\nNo lag in coding, web surfing etc.\nI haven't tried any games yet.........\nThe 512gb ssd is sufficient for me.\nBuild quality is nice, hinge is really good, easily opens with one hand.\nDisplay[60hz] is also good for a laptop but not as good as an real ips display and never compare with an amoled display.\nViewing angles of display are really really good.\nWeight os ok for me.\nDesign of laptop is not like a gaming laptop. This is more like a professional laptop and looks nice and asthetic. I like it.\nThe inbuilt speakers are not good. I don't like speakers at all. But not a big deal 3.5mm jack output and Bluetooth output is really good.\nWifi 6. Connectivity Is good.\n\nAnd don't upgrade to windows 11 right now.",
            "So basically, laptop is well and good. But the huge and huge and huge problem is battery. Battery is drains so fast that you can't imagine, and trust me those who personally use this laptop can say same, and second worst part about this laptop is it's speakers, seriously your mobile phone can play better sound than this laptop.\n\nPros -\n1. Laptop performance is good (4.5)\n2. Laptop display is just ok (4)\n3. You will get fast boot time about 6-8 sec (4.5)\n\nCons -\n1. Worst battery (2)\n2. Worst speakers and not clear as well (2.5)\n3. Laptop is too much heavy than the mentioned weight\n4. Camera is very bad it will give you blurry pictures and videos (2)\n\nThose who want great performance in this range can go for it. But those who like slim and good battery backup laptop plzz go for another one.",
            "product is good and performance is very smooth for video editings it not so good get upgrade for high graphic games handles smoothly\nheat management is good\nbattery backup depends on work for heavy use 1hr,40min for less use 4hr for battersaving 5hr\noverall expereince is very good",
            "A very nice laptop with good display . Also very well performed in day to day activities as well as gaming.\nDefinitely worth for money. Buy it!!!",
            "Best deal in this budget \ud83d\udc4c, boot in just fraction of seconds, really very very fast, performance wise it's best in segment, N-Vidia Graphics card along with 512ssd, makes ideal for gaming & other hevy tasks, only drawback is battery but we should understand that gaming laptop consume more power, rest of the things you will enjoy for sure. What I wants in a laptop it has all.",
            "Value for Money! Amazing Laptop I got! It has mind blowing perfomance, It takes only 8 - 9 sec to boot ! Build Quality is also good...design is excellent ! It is completly made up of plastic but...build quality feels like it has mettalic body ! This is a quick review !",
            "Got this one week before. Still got to learn so much about this pc. Very cool looking and stylish. Nice for small games. Graphic card supports many pc games. Xbox game bar is available.",
            "My suggestion is Don't buy laptop in Flipcart.\nIf the performance is not good, you are not able to return the laptop.They are send Technician and that one also not work.\n\nSo please don't buy.\n\nIf you purchase the laptop that's it.You like or don't like you need to keep the laptop.\n\nReturn policy is very bad.\n\nPlease think and buy.\n\nAnd Laptop battery performance is very poor.",
            "Everything is fine with the laptop. It's fast to boot smooth in gaming but only setback is it's battery life which is not that efficient even if u r doing normal work on laptop. When u r playing a game then it will drown even faster probably running out in something 1-2 hours. everything else is fine. If u don't mind battery life and just want to play games than u should definitely go for it. It's best gaming laptop in this price range.",
            "Giving A review After 1 week Of Usage\n\ud83d\udcaaBATTERY- Before Purchasing acer aspire 7 I had read That it Gives about 1 -2 hour of battery Backup. But In my Case I am getting 3-4 Hours easily after Doing Full charge In Normal Usage(not Playing Games) By the way You can't expect more From a gaming Laptop\n\ud83d\ude0e BOOTING SPEED- It Boots In 7-10 seconds\n\ud83d\ude01 DISPLAY- It is a 15.6 inch display Which looks amazing\n\ud83d\ude0fBUILD QUALITY- build Quality is average. What more you can expect From A 50k laptop( I had purchased It In Sale)\n\ud83d\ude11 GAMING- it gives Maximum Of 1 hour battery Backup while playing heavy Games And Yes you can play heavy games Like COD and GTA because In this laptop you get nvidia graphics card And 8GB Ram( expandable upto 32GB)\n\ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd17 MY OPINION- If You are A Student Then I am telling you to purchase this laptop because It will sustain easily 5-6 Years and Also For Gamers( You can Play heavy games On heavy Resolution by upgrading Ram to 16GB)",
            "OK it's really value for money......for this price it's better than MSI gf63 which is actually has the same price because it has num pad that I use very much...\nLook wise is so simple that I like very much...\nSpeaker is not that bad that many people mentioned... I mean not very good but also not very bad....WiFi capacity is good....USB ports are not as good as it should be\nCooling system works fine, battery is the big issue....and I knew it but its okay because nobody should play games without using charger.....display is not good for accurate color....but for normal usage is okay....performance .is very good specially after update window 11 it works so smooth as butter....keyboard is good.....backlight is simple but I like that....must buy if your budget is not too high\nCasual gaming is not a big deal for this laptop",
            "After using 2 days -:\n\nPerfomance - good\nBattery - ok\nDisplay -good\nBuild quality : could ve been better\nHeating fastly while playing GTA 5 in high setting\n\nBattery in normal - 3-4 hr\nGaming (gta 5 in very hight set) - 1-2 hr\n\n\nMy opinion about this lap : if you want good gaming with other works go for this. Don't expect battery from this laptop and build quilty is also not that great. Buy this lap when it's price is under 53k Or 50k not buy this on 56k\n\nOverall : one of the best laptop under 55k",
            "It's a beast laptop but only 1 thing I don't like is in keyboard center it gets hot n left n right side will be cool. While continues playing slowly the hotness spreads to left or right. But except hot . It's best for 12 hours gaming + steaming live.",
            "I want to say that this laptop is very good for gaming. I have played Gta V and it works very well no lag at all but if you want to play games kindly be sure that the fan vents are not blocked so that the hot air can flow away or else you can face some minor lags on the laptop.",
            "Pros:\n- Value for money\n- Perfect for everyday task\n- Good processor(i5 10th gen - 10300H) and NVMe SSD made it ultra fast.(bios time around 2.5 seconds)\n- Keyboard and trackpad are pretty good\n- RTX 1650 can handle almost all games at 1080P. GTA V can run at high(not ultra) settings,\n- Display is not so great but sure value for money (More than good for everyday use, if you want extra precession use a external monitor)\n- USB C - type enables high quality speed and display\n- No heating issues relatively cool compared to others in market\n- Speakers are good for regular use. since the placement of speakers are straight down to laptop when it is given some air then you are good to go.\n\nCons\n- The only con is battery life. (watched a 2.5 hour length movie + half hour surfing. which turned battery from 95 to 20)\non average you can expect 2.5 - 3.5 hours of battery life.\n\noverall a vey good product",
            "No doubt laptop is good . Best laptop in budget everything is good display and performance is very good but battery and sound of laptop is not good at all max battery backup is 3 hours and the sound is very low you can't use laptop sound without speaker or earphones",
            "Amazing performance.\nUsing battery saving mode, one can easily get 4hrs of battery backup.\nAcer care centre is also a useful thing.\nMake sure to debloat Norton security, it takes a chunk of RAM.\nI upgraded to windows 11 through installation assistant tool, then reset my PC, it's running awesome.",
            "Asus tuf with ditto same features provides 20% better performance. My friend has tuf, he gets 140 average fps with mid settings in valorant and I with aspire get 110 fps average. In case of gta 5, with mid settings tuf gives avg 80 fps and aspire gives avg 55 fps with same settings.",
            "The laptop is not good for gaming . Not a single good Graphics gives above 60+ fps.\nSome games like :-\n\nAll plug-in Game:-\n\n1. Gta 5 ( 45-55fps) Medium settings\n2. Genshin impact 40-55 fps ( Medium settings)\nGenshin impact sometimes drop to 25fps while\n3. fortnite 55-60 fps Medium settings\n\nNote:- Genshin impact Game. Even thou you play at low settings the fps is same as 40-55.\n\nI don't know whats wrong with This Laptop .\n\nAnd the clock speed is showing in the settings of this laptop- CPU @2.50GHz , 2.50 GHz .\nI don't know why it's not showing Max Clock speed 4.20GHz\nU can see in the image",
            "Great laptop except for a few flaws-Charging port is surprisingly difficult to insert the cable into due to a key like shape-needs to be inserted at a specific angle.\n\nColour scheme is definitely on the duller side, which is good for indoor folks like me but for people prefering bright colours, this might be a problem.\n\nThe cooling fan is quite loud but does its job well.\n\nOther than that, no specific complaints so far. Using it for a month now. On time and secure delivery by Flipkart",
            "Best product I have ever buy .please don't buy MSI laptop as its service centers is not available and customer support is 3rd class. Acer product are much much better. in build quality and performance",
            "Gets the work done, mid range topper\nPros: good battery and processor, less boot time because of ssd, good ventilation, got all the required ports, back-lit keyboard, performance was beats everything..\nCons: heats up too much while gaming and other intensive tasks but not on regular usage, display could be better, keyboard is very compact you need to get used to it, speakers are really low",
            "1)Strongly recommend to those who interested to buy gaming laptop under 54k\n2) I loved this laptop \u2763\ufe0f.\n3) battery backup good average upto 5 hr ( only programming)\n4) performance 5 \ud83c\udf1f.",
            "Overall it's awesome. But I am not happy with the battery backup. I recently downloaded Solid Works in my laptop due to that a rapid drain of power was observed without even using the software. Fully charged battery gave a backup of less than 2 hrs with normal usage. But after I uninstalled the software it started providing a backup of more than 6 hrs after a full charge. So as a gaming laptop it is expected to provide a suitable working condition for works in heavy softwares but unfortunately the battery didn't support.",
            "Lovely acer laptop is best laptop value for money best\nBattery backup fast opening system in Mumbai launguage 1number",
            "Flipkart delivery even before time loved it laptop has great performance display also great else I'll say after using for sometime battery is also good",
            "Value of money\nToo good in 50 k range\nPerformance is good\nDisplay is also good\nBattery backup is not so good but ok",
            "Iam reviewing this laptop after using one month.\nGood things:\n1 . Comparing my old laptop without graphic card and this lap performance is well\n\n2. Speed boot and faster start and shut down\n\n3. Designs and accessories ok\n\nBad things:\n\n1 . Battery backup is extremely 2hrs without game and big application iam using only virtual office like zoom meet it's dried after 2 and half hour very worst\n\n2. Camera quality very very worst like VGA camara\n\n3. File transfer is taken too long time\n\n\nOverall this price ok for minimal users like me if you a gamer don't go this lap then you have bad experience",
            "I am using this laptop from past 2 months and my overall experience is good with this product and i see lots of peoples are complaining about its battery life. I am not sure about others products but mine is good .You can try installing NVIDIA geforce gaming drivers for better battery life . It happened with me when i installed studio drivers my battery drains with in 1 hour and after installing again gaming drivers my battery life enhance upto 4 to 5 hours on normal usage.",
            "So i bought it last week and this is my honest review . Battery is ok in browsing but in gaming it gives about 50 mins to max 1:30 hours ...it's a beast everything is smooth ..overall it's good if you're looking for budget gaming laptops but if can buy the amd version of this or the Asus tuf they are better than this and faster ... So recommend if you are on a 50 k budget...",
            "Great deal at this effective price (46k) ... Just hope the audio output of this laptop could be better and otherthen this the laptop is best in the segment ...... It compete with 60k laptops",
            "I am not satisfied this laptop,\ud83d\ude42",
            "1. Display Brightness is medium & just ok\n2. No Free MS OFFICE\n3. Weight of laptop : heavy\n4. No bag included or any freebies just laptop & adapter is given\n5. Performance is good\n6. A good beginners laptop\n7. I would rate it 7/10\n8. No other choice in market if you need a laptop with good graphics at this price range",
            "This laptop is really worth buying \ud83d\ude1a\nSound is average but display is good \ud83d\udc4d\nPerformance is also superb \ud83d\udc4c\nBoot time is also fast \ud83d\udd25\nBattery backup is also not bad actually .\nU can live with it !!!\nMust buy",

            "This is it...you looking for gaming buddy? Just buy this!! I play far cry 5, rdr 2, watch dogs 2, etc with almost ultra graphic settings. And this is soooo dope. Soooo much smooth gameplay , heating issue is actually normal. Not sooo much heating trouble. And the only thing you have to take care is, don't play games without charging. Because, battery don't have the tendency to withstand games like rdr 2. It'll only last upto max 1 or 1and a half hour. Trust me ....I got this lap on aug 3. And today is 12aug. I haven't felt anything bad bout this monster!!! I've been gaming whole day and my mom really regret buying me this\ud83e\udd7a.",

This is a bang for the buck and the best deal you can get.\n\nThe only issue i had is the hinge.

For this usage, it feels snappy.\nNo major hiccups were found even while running some light games. Since this was bought for the tasks mentioned above, I think this gets the job done.\n\nScreen:\nThe stock wallpaper made the display look much worse. But after changing to a high-resolution one, it looks better. The 1080p screen is just adequate for the display size. Both max and min brightness levels are good.\n\nAudio/Speaker:\nDoes the job well enough.\n\nBattery life:\nWith about medium brightness, it lasts about 4hrs which I think is the norm in this price range.\n\nKeyboard & Trackpad:\nThe keyboard is a mixed bag.\n\nPros:\n1. Backlit keys\n2. Key presses are not very loud\n3. The keys feel firm and are not wobbly.\n\nCons:\n1. While it has a full keyboard layout, the key sizes have been reduced. This is annoying for someone that is used to much bigger keys on even smaller laptops.\n2. The keys have very little key travel, making it harder to feel the type.\n3. The trackpad looks tiny for the laptop's size.\n4. The trackpad position is off-centered towards the left and this makes it difficult to access while you are typing away.\n\nDesign & Ports:\nFor this price range, this laptop is extremely good-looking. Even though it is made of plastic, there is no flex, and feels very well built. The weight seems manageable too for the size. The port selection on this laptop is plentiful and they are all useful too.\n\nOverall:\nThough there are some annoying things about the keyboard and trackpad, I feel this is a good overall package for the price.",
