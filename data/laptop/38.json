            "Easily one of the most valuable & wonderful gaming laptops out there.\n\nIf you are a business user who wants more battery backup, portability & laptop for basic business requirements, then this is not for you.\n\nA few things to know if you are purchasing a gaming laptop for the first time.\n\n- Cooling system is very important for gaming laptop.\n- Battery backup is adequate. However, it can be optimised if you work more than play.\n- Fans run quiety to moderately all the time. Somewhere you can get around 45 db which is very decent and hardly noticable.\n\nThat being said, in this price range, this laptop is brilliant. I have used a macbook air and macbook pro for more than a year. I know what is offered by a premium laptop.\n\nHere is where this laptop beats the air & pro (intel edition 13\" inch both):\n\n- The bootup time is simply too good. Also the wakeup from sleep.\n- Graphics\n- Gaming\n- Cooling system.\n\nIn all fairness, apple laptops are not gaming laptops but still it makes one feel good about the decision to get this msi.\n\nRegarding gaming experience\n\nI was able to play Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 easily on this machine. That really is something. The game was smooth and didn't lag at all. I didn't get the actual FPS. The laptop did heat up but at the same time, it cooled really well. It went up to 79\u00b0C. The cool down after gaming is really fast and efficient.\nThis flight sim experience was as good as my series X but of course nothing can beat the Series X. I am not a serious gamer. I play probably at max 2-3 titles.\n\nUsing the dragon center, you can optimise for gaming, work and other activities like graphic design and programming.\n\nI got this for 58,990 rupees which is a fantastic deal for this specs. I searched about 3 months online in many ecommerce sites.\n\nThe only drawback is the keyboard light which is bright red. It would have been better if it was white. (Red is the theme for msi.)\n\nIf you are still worried about battery, you can optimise it to suit the requirements. Don't expect too much in the battery segment. Running jupyter notebook and chrome, I got around 2-3 hours. You can probably optimise it the max to reach 4 hours. Beyond that, I am not so sure.\n\nNvidia is simply outstanding. Once you purchase this laptop, spend time updating windows, nvidia drivers and only then install anything.\n\nIt's better to get a good laptop stand for proper cooling and performance.\n\nReally happy with this purchase. Flipkart delivery was fantastic. I got it the very next day.\n\nThe display could have been better but it's more than decent and appealing for this price range.\n\nImportant Note:- there is no refund system for electronics in flipkart. Only returns and servicing. Make sure you thoroughly search before you decide on a laptop.\n\nThanks for reading this review.",
            "It's a decent laptop in this price range. I was about to finalize lenovo IdeaPad gaming 3 since I wanted ryzen 5 4600h but then this was offered with SSD and one year extra warranty. Also i510500h is almost matched the benchmark of ryzen 5 4600h, both are hexa cores.\nI was concerned about some quality issues in this laptop as reported by some of the reviewers earlier but surprisingly the quality in this one is really good. I noticed that this is manufactured in may 2021. So the stock seems t...\nREAD MORE",
            "I am writing an honest review after using this laptop for the last 20days, my experience has been great. I will explain all the intricate details of this laptop.\nPackaging: I loved the packaging of this laptop, MSI branded cardboard box looks great and the laptop was received in showroom condition with all accessories no complaints, Flipkart did a great job on the delivery as well.\nThe best part is the factory seal at the bottom of the laptop(as shown in the image) it gives me a lot of confidence that the original laptop components are intact and don't have to worry about purchasing this product through an online channel.\nLaptop Performance:\nThis laptop is a beast considering the price range and performance you can get out of it, it's top of its class laptop for any i5 gaming laptop, coupled with a 4GB graphic card, the SSD version does a great job to speed up the bootup and application startups. You can use this for any graphics work, animation, video editing, or any design software like AutoCAD, And of course gaming. everything works so well, never noticed any lag or hanging issues.\nThe laptop has got a good cooling mechanism too.\nBuilt-in Software:\nMSI Dragon Center- This is a pretty cool software to manage the performance of your laptop and optimize device performance and power consumption\nLaptop Ergonomics:\nThe best point of difference of this laptop is the lightweight compared to other gaming laptops with no compromise on build quality and performance makes it a definite buy.\nI personally like the thin bezels, build quality, and keyboard quality with the red lights on them, I like the logo on the lid (wish it had the lighting as well)\nOverall, without any second thought of comparisons buy this laptop if you are planning to buy a new one. and trust me you will never regret it.( You have read my review you don't have to search on anything else, I have purchased this after comparing and researching for the last 1 year :p)",
            "A very good gaming laptop with light weight (compared to my last 1) and a good 1080p display. It also has a very simple design not too much gamey. But it is very much fingerprint magnet and if u don't clean it everyday it will leave a print at various places",
            "I have no negatives to say about this laptop. It gives you excellent performance . Gaming is butter smooth and if you can upgrade the Ram memory then it ensures no stuttering . About the power settings if know to configure with msi dragon centre it does not exceed above 70% when gaming and at normal use it stays at 50-55% . If you don't setup the needed power settings it will produce much heat as everyone mentioning here\nGames played GTA 5 , Battlefield 1 , Red Dead Redemption 2\nEnable cooler booster while gaming and set it in turbo mode therefore less heat and better performance \ud83d\udc4d",
            "One & Only laptop with this much specifications at optimised cost. If i suggest it is completely best for Development & Working with almost all level of Software like Machine Learning, Game Development, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, Block Chain Development, Graphics Development etc.\nSpecially a Smooth Coding & Programming Environment.\n\n6 Cores, 12 CPU, 12 MB Cache Memory, 1TB HDD + 256GB SSD, 8 GB RAM with upto 32 GB expandability, Backlit Keyboard, Clear Speaker, Microphone, Camera",
            "Good",
            "It was a balanced deal for the buck you pay. I5-10500h is in very less laptops right now. Performance is very fast i5-10500 matches with 4600H also gaming performance is good 75\u00b0 is optimum heat it generates not too much also it cools easily .Startup is blazing fast thanks to ssd and dragon center has different mode options",
            "It's my 2nd laptop and happy to share my honest review, after 6 years I decided to move in gaming laptop bcos of heavy graphic design s/w i use like Photoshop, illustrator, after effects and corel draw .\n\nIt's very smooth for operating while using heavy file's and keyboard is very big easily can find , good GPU and processor, light in weight,\nDisplay quality is very clear,\nOverall performance is excellent at 56k price,\n\nBut battery performance is not much good and touchpad is big but after use it feel like loose and make noise when press button .",
            "Excellent performance\nintel 10500H hexa core. No other laptops below 60k range have this processor. SSD speed are also excellent. Good deal if you can buy is near 56k\n\nCONS\n\nNO fingerprint sensor\nNO number keys\nSINGLE FAN.\nEven in very light use, battery just last around 3-4 hrs.\nNOTICED SOME FAN/HDD NOICE ISSUES. I replaced the product due to black line on display. New product also have same noice issue. Don't know more on it",
            "SuperB Product. Highly Recommended. Best in the Segment. Attractive Price.\nNo heating use, no noise issue, very light weight.\nGame i tried- GTA V (super smooth), Valorant (super smooth).\n\n\nPros:-\nBuild Quality- 4.8/5\nDisplay- 5/5\nDesign- 5/5\nLooks- 5/5\nPerformance- 5/5\nCamera- 4/5\nKeyboard- 4.5/5 (looks awesome in red light)\nTouchpad- 4.6/5\n\n\nCons:-\nBattery- 3.5/5\n(Drains Faster even in normal use 1.5 hrs - 2 hours & for gaming 45 mins to 1 hour, its not a big factor for me as this is common in all gaming laptops)",
            "This is my review after a 2 weeks of usage\n1.This system works Fab\n2.The processor speed is so good that you dont fell any latency or glitch while using .\n3. I was bit worried about the fan ,but it really blowed my my mind.Even while playing battle field 5 at high graphics the fan works smoothly.\n4.Storage is dam good.\n5. Sound system is one of the best i have seen till now.\n6.battery is also good works around 4-5 hr in normal use ,while gaming around 2 hr.\noverall best lappy in the price tag!!",
            "In 50490, this beast was a steal.\nThat's why we wait for Big Billion Sale.\n\nThe best thing, 6 core processor and good graphics card, 256 ssd along with hdd.\n\nSet battery to 60% maximum charge limit, and use it on main power unless you really need to use the battery; and Tada, you get 5 to 7 years long battery life. Just discharge and charge battery once every 3 months.\n\nPeople said everything else.",
            "Overall performance wise this is a great choice. You get i5 10th gen hex core with SSD. You also get the HDD already added to it. I am using this for coding, but I ran games like NFS playback, Valorant and Resident evil Village, all games runs smoothly on 60 fps. Only issue is the battey, which can be optimised a little by changing graphic drivers and downloading it from msi support page. Worth the money, must buy.",
            "Great Laptop for the price. The best thing about this laptop is the processor, usually in this price range you get the i5 10300H which has 4 cores but this one has 6 cores and it can easily compete with an i7 10750H. The GPU works well with most games, I play CS and get about 200fps on medium settings. Hasn't really thermal throttled till now.\n\nOverall great value for money for people who want good processing power on a budget.",

            "Used it for a day playing games such as CS Go, Dota 2 and PubG. Working fine and nice aa of now. Heats up a bit but still doesn't affect the performance. I'll share reviews after few days when I play AAA titles as well.\n\nUpdate after 1 month: USB C Type port isn't working. It has malfunctioned.",
            "Have to say .. if you are buying this model... Then get this i5 variant.. it's really gonna help.. and about everything else.. am just extremely happy.. this thing goes through games like hot knife on butter.. it's best as a first gaming laptop.\nultra fast SSD.\nBest one in this price range.\nBest among its competitors of the same configuration.\nVery light weight.\n\nPerformance at affordable cost this i5 variant is superior to all not only in performance as well as price in this range .I used only for weeks and run high performance game like \"watch dog legion\" which come along with gaming bundle. as per me there is moderate heat that not a big issue.\nONLY PROBLEM IS BATTERY\ud83d\udd0bLIFE FOR HIGH END GAMING IT RUN FOR 1~1.5 HOURS AND FOR NORMAL USE IT RUN 3~3.5 HOURS besides this it is good choice for both student in college and for gamer when students are in home",
            "I am using this for about a month now, it can play almost any game very smoothly.\n\nit can run 5-6 hrs on power saving mode but in gaming mode battery life is reduced to an hour.\n\nIt's speed is impressive, thanks to sdd.\nIt can boot up in 5 seconds.\n\nTyping is very smooth and user friendly, i use it for coding.\n\nDisplay is very good, it can run 4k quality video very smoothly.\n\nI am pleased with my purchase.",
            "Best laptop in this price range. Usually in other laptops we get either 1tb HDD or 512gb SSD but in this laptop we get 1tb HDD and 256gb SSD both.

Tried running multiple apps with heavy usage, this laptop just handled them very fine. Switched between Linux VM and Windows with multiple apps running very smoothly.\n2) RAM management is also great.\n3) Light weight\n4) Red backlit keyboard looks really cool. Some may not like it though.\n5) USB C port and LAN port connectivity.\n\nCons:\n1) An LCD screen it is. Not good in 2021. Also the quality of LCD screen could have been better.\n2) Build quality could have been better. I felt it is little weak at the hinges.\n3) Gets heated while moderate to heavy gaming. Only 1 fan feels inadequate here. But interestingly the performance is still good and the cooling is great, it cools down very fast.",

First thing to do is conduct battery calibration in Dragon Center\na. Update the Dragon Center (if any latest update is available)\nb. Plugin the charger\nc. Open the Dragon Center\nd. Click on tools\ne. Click on Battery Calibration\nf. Battery calibration will start now, it will charge the battery to 100% (Don\u2019t remove the charger), post that it will discharge to around 5%, post that it will charge again to\n100%, after this the calibration is completed (Please don\u2019t use the laptop till the calibration is completed and it will take some time to complete, so I would suggest\ndoing it when you go for sleep)\n2. Change the user scenario to \u201csuper battery\u201d\na. Open the Dragon Center\nb. Click on home button\nc. Click on user scenario\nd. Select super battery\n3. Update it to Windows 11\n4. Change the power mode to \u201cBest power efficiency\u201d (Windows 11)\na. Open windows settings app\nb. Select \u201cPower & battery\u201d\nc.

Just go for it .you won't regret it\nThe only problem I feel battery backup is low while gaming I play GTA 5.for better performance play while charging but for normal use battery can last up to 2 to 3 hours\nIf you are looking for a laptop for student and casual gaming this is for you it's very thin. You can take it outside. Normally all gaming laptops have weight over 2.5kg but this is only 1.8kg and also very thin. Laptop is so silent\nIt has only 1 fan and two vends but there is no heating problem while gaming. But always be aware of that the Temperature must not go above 80\u00b0C it will affect your performance after all. I prefer to buy a cooling pad with it if you are a gamer.

Fan Noise is alright;\n\nSpeakers and Drivers : Speakers are amazing and driver support is also great\n\nNote : For Undervolting , you'll have to enable Overclocking in advanced BIOS Settings\nAlso Hi-Res support is wired only.\n\nConclusion : If you want to have a very powerful all round machine and don't mind the battery life then go for it",

The pre-installed dragon center has settings for high performance, battery saver and silent running and a customisable mode to control fan speed or cpu and GPU clock speeds. Overall good laptop build. This one also has a 256gb SSD apart from the 1 tb hdd.",

            "The beast that I received recently was nevertheless below what I excepted. Be it the style, the performance, and the ease of access, all of them were at par with the standards. The Nvidia card on the top at such a price range is beyond its competition. Overall optimization of the CPU with inbuilt support of MSI Dragon Center boosts up the performance to top-notch. Was playing asphalt 9 on high settings and had no issues playing the game. Fans were performing as required keeping fairly low CPU and GPU temperature. Overall a great pick for price and specifications.",
            "Just Buy it and thanks me later",
            "Battery life is poor, 3-4 hr max on charging.",
            "It is an amazing laptop for the money paid. It fulfilled my expectations. But battery performance is average, on working battery saver and switching off some performance and feature only It gives upto 5hr battery working time.\n\nStill It is amazing laptop, but battery performance can increased... and it takes nearly 2.30 to 3 hours to get full charge. Charger adapter also gets hot quiker.",
            "I bought this laptop in July and I used it almost 2 month so I write this review now. Positive side of this:- Laptop is best value for money\nBest performance for every heavy software like solidworks, AutoCAD, Ansys.....Etc\nBest graphics for video editing, image editing......\nBest graphics for gaming like GTA V, Hitman 3.....\nBest Design and built quality (Metallic body)\nNice Screen display\nWifi speed is also excellent\n\nNegative side:-\nVery less battery backup\nSome fan noise when work on heavy software and games\n\nI think everything have their pros and cons but Overall my experience regarding this laptop is excellent.",
            "MSI products are awesome and known for high performance even price looks quite expensive",
            "Nice product",
            "The first impression is fantastic.\nIt's body is a finger magnet, so you may need to add a sticker to avoid a greasy appearance.\nFor a gaming laptop, the battery life is adequate. You'll get up to 2.5 to 3 hours of normal use (if you've set battery saver mode in MSI Dragon centre) and 45 to 60 minutes of gaming (I've only tried with GTA V).\nBecause this is a single-fan laptop, it can get a little bit hot while playing AAA games, but it cools off quickly and has no effect on performance.",

            "Nice",

            "This is such an awesome machine with loads of perfomance on offer and at a very great price. On seeing the graphic card with max q design what I thought was that the performance will go up compared to the gtx 1650 but the performance is a bit low. The thermal efficiency it has was just impeccable with adjustable fan speed in the dragon center. Comparatively speaking, I used asus tuf laptop with GTX 1650 which used to heat all the upto 80\u00b0C but this manages every single hard load under 70\u00b0C. Overall this is a beast of a machine.",
