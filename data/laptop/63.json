            "Its my review after used after 5 months.\nIts not a valuable laptop for study or any smooth working purposes.\nIssues:\n1. Connectivity issues I m facing now. Specially usb port.\n2. Battary performance was well for first 3 months. After it drains quickly without any playing video or audio. Only pdf reading it running hardly 2 hrs.\n3. web camera is very bad performing like 0.3mp.\n4. The processor also very slow and sometimes its hanging that one can't move for other work.\n5. In sunlight one can't see the display correctly.\nConclusion: I don't recommend to purchase asus laptop. Go to any other companies.\n\nIf the person who wants for storage and only for audio or first learner then he or she can go for purchase it. It will be good.",
            "it's quite good ,and one important thing to do while updating win 10 or download win 10 don't turn up your laptop it's quite risky when you download your update quickly install and restart it\nand we are thinking about display quality it's good you can also play video upto 4K on youtube but first of all I think display quality is very poor cause of TFT panel but wrong TFT panel is also good but not like that IPS .\n\nWhen you use it for office work then download WPS office it's good and features like World office",
            "a god product for students, i'm writing this review after use of 1 month, if you use it only for online class and watching you tube then it's best for you & also its consumes less data if you setting in metered connection. so don't worry about data consumption.\n\npros- good battery back up & charging very fast, clear resolution screen and it's comes with a classy look\n\ncons- a little bit slower, * It's takes 30-40 sec to open and after open it takes 3-5 sec to being ready to use and the refresh process.\n\n# you can't run smoothly video/photo editing software on this.",

Over all at this price it is worth to buy it has 1 year warranty but after few days we get notification of extension of warranty for another 1 year it is good to have total 2 years warranty for this laptop.",
            "Writing this review after full 24 hours of putting this machine to grind. I bought this with a certain kind of apprehension, wondering the budget I had, the choice made after thorough research and the product chosen would cater to my needs or not? However, this piece of beauty is well equipped to go smoothly with my expectations of a big clear display, clear voice and word/pdf typing/reading works. A word of caution to the gamers though..

It cannot perform basic documentation even with minimal needs, you can finish 2 cups of tea by the time it is loading applications.
