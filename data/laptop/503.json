            "Fabulous design, premium matte finish, looks awesome\nBuild quality is good, plastic but solid built\nFast processor and ssd makes operating smooth\nDisplay is good ..\nSupports all gestures\nBattery 6-7 hrs\nNormal heating ...\nJustifies the price overall good for medium user\n\nCONS\ncamera not that good",
            "The laptop looks good overall - Thin bezel, ag ips display and the slightly slanted keyboard, got a very good laptop bag.\nFound some issues with the laptop -\nFan noise is too loud when the speed goes high, and heat is getting blown on to the bottom side of the screen. Dont know if this is a good idea in the long run.\nOffice subscription is only for 1 year ** its office personal not h and s, but you get extra apps like onedrive, onenote etc.\nThe laptop speaker sound quality isnt that great. Its having decent loudness though.\nscreen brightness is not that great.\nOnly 2 usb ports provided.",
            "Laptop has Matt Looks and design is very decent\nOverall a good deal. This is only the first day review, everything found excellent except some heat at the battery side. Will try to elaborate more after using it for a week.\n\nIt has been now more than a week and now I am decreasing one star as it really heats at the back and yes there is a little sound of Fan's noise as well.\nRest the laptop is really fast and happening.\nOverall it's ok till now.\n\nLet's see further.",
            "Thin and light, the overall form factor of the laptop describe being 15.6 size is a bit smaller. The display is quite enough with good viewing angles and better than most HP/DELL Laptops is this range. The body is made of plastic but trust me it's amazing. I use this laptop for meetings/office work/surfing/movies. Ryzen 3500u is good enough to handle this kind of usage and in this form factor makes it a good deal. Right side numeric keypad is an added benefit for users!",
            "First look is impressive, very thin and lightweight, Dispaly is bright and good, superfast performance with windows 10 and SSD with 8 gb of ram, Reason of 4 star is I found some heating on the back, It is quite acceptable for me as I'm normal user, but not sure it is temporary or permanent, One more thing is it has inbuilt battery so you can't remove it, Overall good performance and worthy product.",
            "Great laptop.... Black variant is looking like a cheaper one.. but great performance. Average camera..",
            "Yeah I've used 3days . I felt little bit heat under the laptop. But it's ok when we use on table it won't heat if we place it on bed it will get heat. Charging by closing the laptop it will take 1.20 min to charge 0 to 85\nPros:\n*Price..I think won't get better deal than this.\n*8GB ram , 512 ssd ,40 wt fast charging, ryzen 5 quad core\n*Disply ok for me.\n*Sound good\n*Windows 10\n*Discharging time 5hours for me\n*Looks premium but it's semi plastic\nCons:\n*Getting little bit heat . But its common in amd ryzen processor.\n*Camera only 1mp\n[Ryzen 5 quad core is better than i5 and less than i7]\nOverall (7.5/10)\nGo for this.",
            "Excellent Laptop by Vaio\nDisplay is very good with thin bezzels.\nProcessor is very fast, it takes just 5-6 seconds to start the pc\nLaptop bag given with laptop is of nice fabric quality\nOverall highly satified with the product",
            "Super laptop with great performance, look supub and premium. as a IT guy I must recommend to all this lappy.",
            "This is my detail review of my laptop\n1) performance is excellent as expected than other laptop very smooth very handy and super duper fast.\n2) ips display is simply amazing no doubt\n3) It's okay battery lacks in between and yes their is a slightly noise of fan and heating is also fine.o Otherwise its very ease to guys I would strongly recommend go for this product.\nOnly for office or personal use not at al gaming.\nThanks you flipkart for delivering the product very properly .\nThank you flipkart team and management for taking the responsibility In such a sistematic way.",
            "Excellent product in the range of 45-50k. Looks are premium, display was decent and good enough as compared to other laptops in this budget range. It was mentioned that it contains office but the truth is it gives an office 365 subscription for one year after which we need to renew (drawback). Sound quality was not up to the expectations, it is not that loud enough which we can get from the competitors. It delivers an exceptional performance with fast booting time and can run all the applications smoothly.\n\nI would recommend this product for students/ working professional as it is good for running applications like MATALAB, CAD Softwares and other office applications including gaming",
            "I have been searching for a laptop from few days and I finally decided to go for VAIO e15 . First thanks to flipkart for fast delivery.It has a great display, booting was very fast because of the AMD ryzen 5, decent battery back up 4 to 5 hours depending on our usage , body made up of plastic but looks premium and backlit keyboard was good. Speakers volume could have been better.\nAfter 5 months I've observed no major issues so far but it's heating while browsing and some light editing.",
            "Good Performance. Booting time less than 30 seconds. very fast. In built MS Office 365. In first boot don't connect to internet, other wise the system will automatically download latst Win 10 update, whch will take more than 90 minutes.",
            "A fantastic laptop bought it for my daughter and she has very much inspired to this beautiful kid. Thank you Flipkart and thanks to SONY VAIO!",
            "Good in speed very nice to handle but battery performance little bit low compare to which i expected more over everything is good like a premium laptop display is awesome in vaio..",
            "Very good and smooth functioning laptop. Even my friends and relatives are impressed very much and some of them are planning to buy it. Battery backup is upto four hours while online usage and the same works more than five hours offline. Thanks alot Vaio team and Flipkart.",
            "I'm writing this review after 5 months of usage.\n\nVaio is a well known brand. I usually check all the specifications before I buy any gadget. It works amazingly fast and smooth.. No doubt about that. These are my classifications based on my usage.\n\nFor students : It's the best in the range. It has all the specifications we need to do daily tasks by the students.\nFor Coders : Yes, It is good. As a SE, I'm using this laptop for the past 6 months and It did a great job for me.\nFor Creators : It is not much recommended as it has comparatively does low in RAM and Graphics card.\n\n8gb RAM and 512 SSD is far more enough for students and coders for sure\n\nComing to processor, It has very good processor names AMD Ryzen 5 3500u which is good in handling multiple cores.\nPS: It has some heating issue while charging.(But improper earthing could be the reason for it (In my case it is not heating once I resolved earthing issue)\nNote : It is Polycarbonate body. Do not expect to be tough and rigid. In fact, it feels delicate on the first touch.\n\nThis laptop is not recommended for rough users.\nThank you.... :)",
            "After one week laptop display issue 2 line coming from display and report to customer service and good support to change display after one week but repair agency roughly use laptop and lots of scratches in front area so laptop look like 2nd hand laptop so I recommend to don't waste buy this laptop because my laptop after repair look like second hand laptop ,so I think why I am buy this viao laptop ..",
            "After one week my experience says...\nLooks and display- 5star\nBattery drains too fast however gives around 4 hr backup\nWorking on Microsoft office is a big challenge. It's not activating on laptop even after many tries and login through paid membership as well though it was. Microsoft product key doesn't comes automatically as suggested by Vaio.\nSound ia too low , have to use portable Bluetooth speaker for online classes.\nOverall a 3 star as I am still using it for browsing and mail purpose only.",
            "It's a good laptop. But the keyboard keys are very light & loose. It can break easily. Also, there are no enough ports in this laptop. The charger provided is also missing Vaio branding, which means it's a local Chinese charger.\n\nElse, the performance is decent for day to day activities. Boot is fast due to SSD.",
            "Super laptop value for money laptop bag also super",
            "Beautiful looking. Backlit keyboard. Built solid. Also got a beautiful laptop cloth bag. worth it.",
            "It's really a good product",
            "Premium quality",
            "Aswame product\nPicture quality is very very awesome\nDisplay quality beetter tan all\nPremium looking",
            "Nice",
            "Excellent for daily use\nIt's fast, efficient and good looking.\nDisplay is brilliant\nBattery lasts about 4+ hours if ms office or chrome browsing is done.\nThe only problem is heating, it's slightly high when compared to other laptops.",
            "Everything is fine, except some issues with Wifi hardware. Still facing issue with the wifi. Initially system was not detecting the hardware for wifi. Now It got disconnected very frequently even with a good network strength. Also troubles when we try to connect with a new network.",
            "Compact design, soothing keypad and mouse board. Fast response as per cost and expectation. Microsoft office 365 valid for 1 year. Unfortunately the fan speed to too high to tolerate!",
            "Today i received this laptop. Packing is so good and flipkart take care of safety during packing.",
            "First of all This laptop is value for money and its good to use for office purpose and if you are game addict try some other laptop",
            "The laptop is great I'm happy to use this.\nIt's really awesome to see the logo design and over all performance is awesome. Go for it you won't regret it after buying \ud83d\ude42",
            "I am reviewing this laptop after using around 5 months (light use only). This laptop has stunning design and display. Boot time is very less, the moment you switch on the laptop you will be in your login screen, thanks to AMD for that. Good clarity while watching movies and all. Green color light in power on/off button light is a bit annoying when use in dark esp., watching movies. Battery backup is a bit poor and also heating issue is there (can't use by lap for long time).",
            "Excellent design and light weight, booting also good. Overall nice ... Thanks to VAIO",
            "Was excited to see the product while unboxing. During initial setup, laptop was not connecting to wifi and I had to set it up via without internet option where you don't get most of the apps installed. However next day the laptop was receiving wifi signal and I had to do windows reset to begin the setup process afresh.\n\nI noticed heating issue which I also read in reviews by others. Thus I assume its a common issue in Vaio.\n\nDesign is elegant and I liked the slanting position of keypads when it is placed on the desk. However when it is placed on lap, it bothers you due to that extra projection at the bottom of the laptop which is intended to give a slanting position for keypads. Display is awesome.\n\nI haven't used the laptop for long hours, hence I am not sure about the battery performance. I have Lenovo laptop with same configuration and I was curious to perform speed test for comparison. I noticed the speed is almost same in both the laptops.",
            "Nice \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",
            "Never buy,I am facing lot of problems with this laptop within 1 months",
            "Best Laptop within Range with 8GB Ram and 512GB SSD.",
            "Very good product, Value for money,Go for it\nExcellent build quality.",
            "WORST! Don't buy or regret sooner\n\nLaptop body is catching finger oil very easily from sweaty fingers and after that it is very difficult to remove it.\n\nWhen I am lifting the laptop with one hand, it looks like its gonna break. A little bit bending.\n\nKeys from Keyboard are making creepy noise while typing.\n\nWhen switching on the laptop, screen is bright from sides, and after everything loads up, it goes fine.\n\nKeys setup is somewhat different from default keyboards. You have to get used to it.\n\nType C Charger should have been provided.\n\nAfter using 5 months:\n\nThis is the worst product and worst service I have seen.\nCa\n\nmera stopped working. My request is pending since last 35 days and camera still not dispatched.\n\nWhen I call customer care every time they say we are escalating to hire management. It happened 4 times.\n\nNow, it stopped working abruptly. Not even charging.\n\nI feel moron to trust vaio. Please do not buy this brand.\n\nWorst Product in the History of mankind and the worst company without any plan for service...\n\nEdit1 : after 2 months, I got the replacement for the laptop, they gave me silver color instead of black which is 6k less. But it is ok for me. But the product quality is sooo bad that I will not even buy it for 20k.\n\nPlease avoid this laptop, there are very good laptops in the market in this price range.\n\nDo not choose Vaio.",

            "Thanks to Flipkart, i purchased this product on a massive discount! Definitely worth the buy, but giving only 4 stars as the camera and speaker quality/output is very poor. Those who are looking to buy this laptop for online classes, you need to spend few more bucks on bluetooth or external speakers.",

Editing review after one month of use. Camera stopped working within 2 weeks. Lodged complaint with helpline. Technician asked me to send images of the issue!! Even after two days, he's yet to turn up. Pathetic service. Don't buy Vaio or Avita brands.",

            "The worst laptop ever. I purchased this in Jan 2021 under the impression that this is the Vaio under Sony, which was a great laptop. This Vaio is owned by Nextgo & service by Avita. Except, for the looks, there is nothing good about this laptop. In less than a year, I have faced keyboard, display, webcam, sound and heating issues. The keyboard even got replaced but every day there is a new problem and the worst part of this laptop is terrible after sales service. Also there is no option to sell this laptop in exchange, I am stuck with this horrible product. Please do not buy this Vaio laptop, especially the amd ryzen one, you will only regret like me.",

Also since the very first week of purchasing this laptop, I started facing laptop freeze issue while running two browsers at same time. The CPU Usage goes to 100% without using any other application except two browsers. So overall this laptop is stylish but comes with the major issue i.e. heating, freeze and slow speed. Also, the battery remains for 2 hours only after the full charge.",
