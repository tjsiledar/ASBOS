            "bought it a month ago for a good deal, so consider this a review after one month. im a engineering student who does casual gaming, video editing along with other study related tasks like doing autocad, solidworks, matlab and stuff. im sure most of you can relate with this. so talking about the laptop, it is a monster. great laptop for the price point ( got a GTX 1060 for around the same rate as GTX 1050ti laptops with the sane specs). so getting into the good stuff\nPROS:\n# The processor and graphics combo: man! this is just too good, any demanding tasks could be easily done without breaking a sweat. For gaming, any newer AAA titles you throw at it run like butter on medium-high settings ( For the older ones like CS-GO, battlefield 1, ultra settings are also playable) >60fps.\n#The looks: Be sure to raise some eyebrows wherever you carry this badboy! The top lid shines bright due to the brushed aluminum panel and the red air vents behind the laptop make it look even cooler!\n#3)PredatorSense: The gamer friendly app! Control fan speed, monitor CPU,GPU temperatures, overclock graphics, this app can do it all.\n#4)Screen: Honestly, i was expecting a mediocre screen, but this one turned up to be surprisingly good! I could easily work outdoors on 75 percent brightness, and the color quality was awesome for a 60Hz screen!\n#5) 16 gigs of RAM, baby!: i mean! what more can you expect, 16 gigs SODIMM 2666 MHZ RAM.. more than enough, even if you are a heavy gamer!\n#6)The speakers and keyboard: The speakers are not the best at producing bass but they are well beyond average for a laptop, the volume was enough to fill a small room (or a car) and there doesn't seem to be any distortion at max volume. The keyboard is great, i could type on hours together without being fatigued! The red backlighting is a cherry on top of the cake..\n\nso the dark side? yes, did find a few flaws\n#1) The thermals (obviously): The cooling is not as good as advertised. It is fine if you are, you know going through documents, reading books, listening to music, watching a movie (it barely crosses 50\u00b0C). but if you are going to consider gaming for long hours non stop, this one is going to blow steam at your face ( not literally..), after playing far cry 5 for 3 hours, the max temperature reading was 98\u00b0 C and it started throttling hard, woah! i mean, what is that! even under max fans, the max temperature was 92\u00b0C after 4 hours but the great news is that it doesn't throttle under max fan speed! ( average stays around 85\u00b0), i understand that FC5 is a demanding game but these temperatures are too high.. But, the laptop was fine for gaming like a stretch of an hour or a half, the temperatures were around 82\u00b0.(yet to try undervolting the CPU and GPU)\nP.S:If the temperatures cross 90\u00b0, turn the game off and max the fans and leave it be for 5 minutes. Go get a coffee if you will.The temperatures drop to 55/60 and then resume gaming.. this helps a lot!\n#2) Screen: ( not a big issue) as i said, its bright! it gets hard to read word documents in the dark even at minimum brightness.( This is if you're a nocturnal)\n#3)Fingerprint magnet: not a huge problem tho.\n\nBenchmarks:Haven't played much games yet but the ones i did, ( used MSI afterburner for benchmarking)\nFar cry 5, 1080p ultra settings: 63 fps avg\nMordern warfare, 1080p, highest settings: 260 fps avg ( holy smokes!)\nCS-GO, 1080p,highest settings: 200fps average\nRainbow 6: siege, ultra settings, 1080p: 140 fps average\n\nOverall, excellent laptop. Definitely would recommend. .",
            "cant believe i got a GTX 1060 6gb edition plus an i7 8750h and 16gb ram config. for 96,990 rs. (mrp is 1lakh 40 thousand), loving flipkart for this. This got the best cooling n ips screen right now for this price range. can run literally any game @60fps 1080p ,ultra- high mix of settings, got delivered in 2 days -excellent product",
            "Performance:\nAll the high end games work on highest settings on 60 fps, I think it can even run faster if the fps capping was more than 60. You can play fortnite, pubg, gta5 any game at ultra settings with zero lag. So performance wise it's a beast.\nBattery:\nThe rating of battery is given according to gaming laptops, normally these heavy end gaming laptops give 2-3 hrs of battery but this one is giving easily 4-5 hrs.\nDesign:\nThe design is super cool and the fans are located in such a way that it doesn't target your lap, so that's a good thing.\nThe body is finger print attractor but you can always clean it. After heavy end gaming for very long, as the bosy is metallic, body near keyboard gets little hot but that's not an issue.\nDisplay:\nThe display quality is really great and things run very smooth.",
            "The laptop is amazing but my screen hinges were lose it makes sound whenever I touch the side of the screen",
            "I've heard many people complaining about battery but trust me it is worth for a gaming laptop. It's not a book obviously. For general web browsing it goes upto 4.5 to 5 hours. For gaming it goes to 1.5 to 2 hours but gaming is always preferred while charger plugged in. Also the predator sense helps me drop the temperature really fast from 85\u2103 to 45\u2103 within 5 mins so overall it is a beast.",
            "got this beast in bbd and this is a gaming beast only battery issue rest excellent",
            "This right here is a monster. If you're looking for an amazing gaming laptop within 1 lakh budget, blindly go for this. There are lot of reviews on the pros and cons so I'm not going to say the same again. However please note that this is only a 60Hz screen refresh rate. I had used the chat option within the product page to check with the representative on if it's a 144Hz Screen refresh rate or 60Hz since it wasn't part of the description. The representative assured that it is 144Hz refresh rate. When I got the laptop, it's only 60Hz instead. I'm still happy with the purchase since it is still a monster at this price range, but reducing one star because the rep should be more educated before giving a response.",
            "I was little scared reading some flipkart review that it sometimes deliver refurbised product , but delivery was nice it was sealed properly and Serial NO. was matching with the bill. laptop is little under performing while gaming I am getting around 45 fps at ultra setting in gta 5, but I saw people are playing it at 80 fps on youtube at ultra settings, I am using Predator sence to boost gpu. people were complaining that it crosses 92 degree c but my lappy never crosses 80.",
            "one of the best one in the world...worth every penny!!!! thank you flipkart....",
            "heating issue bro it bevomes a frying pan during games",
            "I bought it in a big billion days sale and it is a beast.\nU won't get such a gaming laptop under 1 lakh.\n\npros :\n\n1) good design and performance.\n2) gtx 1060 allows u to play 97% games with high settings.\n3) display is amazing.\n4) ips display is good at both editing and gaming.I am sure that u won't disappoint with screen.Screen and its quality is amazing.\n5) good cooling system.\n6) keyboard is good for typing and playing.\n7) dolby atmos.\n8) multi gesture touchpad makes easy to control.\n\ncons...\nREAD MORE",
            "Best Laptop under 1 lakh , but I bought on discount for 95k the package has 2 brand seal on the laptop box ,the laptop they send to me is a refurbished one but works fine. But I didn't return it because it works fine and I am in urgent required for such laptop . Flipkart should check for such activities made by sellers",
            "I'm impressed . Good for architecture rendering for students . battery gets drained fast . Good display and sound is awesome. overall it's really good . got it in the sale",
            "Thanks to flipkart . This laptop is a Beast in performance and is at good prices, I got it for 94990Rs. I am Fully satisfied with its performance.\n\n*Well Packed from seller.\n* Fast delivery just in 24 hours considering my place is a town.\n\n\n*The Best in performance you won't face any problem in dealing with any high graphics games and softwares.\n*Heating is not much in normal use but if you game hard then it will heat but it can be cooled by adjusting it's modes. The user should manage the laptop according to the Task.\n*Comparing to other similar specifications laptop I think choosing Acer Predictor is best option because of good discount which makes it 25000- 45000Rs less compare to other laptops.\n\nFor me buying this laptop from Flipkart is amazing.\nSince I am a student and I used to create 3D designs of Mechanical parts and electronic circuits using AutoDesk softwares as Maya, Inventor ext all this softwares runs smoothly without any issues.\n\nExcellent Experience.",
            "Good Awesome Laptop, Being an IT Network Engineer i suggest this laptop. Good for high end applications, Gaming, for running Cisco Networking application, GNS3, VMware, HyperV(with Win-10 Pro) For CCIE routing and switching lab learning, this laptop is best with 32GB RAM. Go for it if u r a gamer and high end software/application user.\nThanks",
            "This is a awesome product by Acer. I love this product very much not only because of its design, because of its performance. Its very fast and powerfull. Build for heavy gaming. it's really a predator, no other laptop in this price range can tackle its performance. predator helios 300 have i7 8750H processor its one of the higher end processor having good benchmark. The booting time and predator sense app, these things make this laptop go beyond and always ahead of any other laptop in this range. we can do over clocking with the help of inbuilt predator sense app. The real predator power is its 6 GB 1060 GPU. You don't have a second option to think for this price.",
            "Thank you Flipkart for lightning fast delivery within 2 days of ordering. I got it on sale with no cost EMI. The laptop was packed properly. Amazing gaming laptop at this price range.\nThis is what I feel after 12 days of usage.\n\nFor this price this laptop delivers big time. I bought it for photo processing using Lightroom and Photoshop and equally to game too. With 16gb ram and i7-8th gen the laptop can literally handle any application.\nComing to games, GTX 1060 6GB is doing pretty great work. Games like MK X and Dishonored 2 gives 60fps at ultra settings. Any AAA title game should be handleable with this monster. Especially I was surprised with how it can handle METRO EXODUS smoothly.\nOther than that, the speakers are pretty good for the price and the display has really good viewing angles and is lit enough for movies and gaming. The track pad is smooth and does the job well.\n\nSo far I've given a good picture. Let's see the cons now. The cons here are the battery life and the thermal issue. Lemme tell you how I handle it.\n\nWhen I tried running Prey on ultra settings, the laptop did deliver good performance but for the first time I saw the CPU n GPU temps rise to 87\u00b0C. Then I maxed out the fans in predator sense and it came down to 65\u00b0in two mins. After reading about it a lot, the best thing to do to avoid over heating or even thermal throttling is to keep the laptop on an elevated surface as the air vents for intake are on the bottom. I use an old non-functioning fan as the base while gaming so the airflow is good. This definitely helps reduce 5-8\u00b0C. I've not tried undervolting yet, so can't comment on that.\n\nThe battery.... Wish Acer gave a bigger battery. Two things to note while gaming on battery. 1. FPS DROPS significantly. Needs settings adjustment in Nvidia panel and windows power management settings. 2. Abnormal rate of battery drain. Drops to 20 from 100% within 40 mins.\nWith light work and downloading in the background, I got around 3.5-4hrs of battery runtime.\n\nIn a nutshell, though battery life and cooling systems could've been way better, this laptop is still a steal at this price. Go for it. The performance is unparalleled.",
            "Got it for 90k after all the offers Includee, I was skeptical about the processor because it's not the high end i7 8th gen , not clocked to 4.1 but medium clocked...\n\nthis wont effect gaming or any other multimedia software you use but can show difference in 4k output and multitasking or running VMware etc.\n\ncooling is good, gets hot but cools down very fast.\n\nnot so impressed about display,sound and mousepad. can be okay.\n\nbest thing about laptop is price at which u are getting the whole thing for.. it works are as expected.",
            "Review after a week.\n\n1.But Runs hot when playing aaa titles at max settings for 30 mins if you let the predator sense in auto mode, thermal throttling is there. It is recommended that you put it in boost mode to avoid such throttling.\n\n2.acer has sacrificed battery life while making this product cost effective. Could have given a bigger battery.\n\nBut it's what you get with the price. Go for it.",
            "super beast",
            "The screen refresh rate is 60hz unlike the PH315-51 available outside India whose refresh rate is 144hz. Keep this in mind before buying.",
            "It is a beast, the specs is powerful enough for each and every games till date.\nIt gets heated pretty quickly but gets cool quickly too. It doesn't have separate buttons to control the fans through keyboard,you have yo do it through predator sense. Neither any buttons to control keyboard light. The body is strong and has a premium feel to it.\nIt sucks air from the bottom so if possible .. keep the laptop lifted up a little to ease the flow of air\nI undervolted thorough XTU, but got constant BSOD when in -155 voltage\nso i am keeping it in -140 and is stable right now .. the temperature of CPU gets around 88 degrees maximum while GPU gets around 75 degrees after undervolt",
            "Awesome laptop. Thank you flipkart for this amazing deal. I got it only 91,400. Just go for it. Everything is perfect.",
            "Amazing quality and got it delivered within 48 hrs. Feels amazing and soft and works like flash.",
            "This is a great device at a great price. The overall build is great, solid with no flex. The keyboard is good, and the backlight is fine. GTX 1060 needs no review, with 6GB it's a beast for 1080p gaming. The core i7 gets a bit toasty, thermals could have been better but having said that, a 6 core 12 thread processor will heat up anyways. The processor and graphics card perfectly compliment each other and the 128GB SSD is really fast. It's at par with Samsung 850 Evo interns of speed, I used it earlier. Overall, it's a great but especially if it's running on a deal.",
            "performance truly reflects the specs this beast comes with! Nice and sturdy body which looks premium. Played FIFA 19 and PES 19 with no lags.. although I thought the screen might have been better with at least 120 Hz display.\noverall, worth every penny you invest for gaming and entertainment!!!\nI strongly recommend this beast to game lovers!",
            "This laptop is a beast. It's been three days and I am in love with it.\n- The display is amazing, great color accuracy.\n- You don't even need headphones for gaming, the sound quality is really good.\n- Have tested Assassin's creed : Odyssey, getting 45-60 fps in ultra settings | GTA V : Around 80-100 fps in max settings | COD WW2 : 60+ FPS in Max Settings\n- The front camera is really poor :( I have used cheaper laptops( under 25K), even those laptops have a better camera quality.\n- Of course - The Issue of overheating (which isn't really an issue) Initially The temperature was reaching 90 degrees, but then I undervolted the cpu by -0.150 V and the average temperature even after a couple of hours of gaming doesn't go above 80 degree, so if you face the same problem under-volt your core - It's safe and effective.",
            "Great Laptop with blazing fast boot times thanks to the 128 Gi SSD. Games run super smooth too.",
            "Got This Laptop At 92 K During the big billion day sale, Just gonna say one thing, there aren't any better gaming laptop than this, It can literally run any game at its maximum graphic settings.",
            "Best for the price offered. Can handle any tasks thrown at it. Gaming on this beauty is a bliss. Only issue can be heating, but that can also be fixed by the PredatorSense s/w that comes in-built. Go for this product without any second thoughts. Try to get it under 1lakh :)",
            "For the price I got it (95k) the laptop is very good.",
            "Amazing laptop and amazing service on the flipkart part.The only thing I wanna mention is the battery life is poor if u are someone who has to work on the go I would suggest looking for some other option otherwise the laptop performance and design is perfect and the thermals are also good",
            "Great specification, enough to be abreast with tech for at least next 5 years gaming's. Form factor is too good. Speakers not very great. Heats up fast but predator sense cools it down. 1 star for seller, box seal was already compromised. Why you guys selling stuff worth lakh with seal open. How to trust you guys.",
            "so im using this laptop from couple of months and its been a good experience till now. the only issue im getting now is the heating problem while playing games like cs go and pubg even while turning the coolboost and increasing fan speed other than this the laptop is best for gaming and giving a good fps too and if you are confused msi and acer go for acer cause it has good battery back up. JUST FEEL TO ASK ANY QUESTION REGARDING THIS LAPTOP :)",
            "Performance wise one of the best in this price range, but the main thumbs down is the cooling system. One just can't play any high graphics game in indian summer (at around 40 degree centigrade) . Even the processor shows power throttling for high demanding games with the provided charger, which is approx 200 watt. Most of the power gets diverted to the cooling fans. The display is also not as vibrant as others in this segment. Battery life is not bad when the gpu is turned off.",
            "under budget gaming beast\nwith the use of predator sense boost while charger is plugged in u can play any game at ultra settings\nscreen is ok(as per price range) but not excellent\nbattery drainage is so fast so keep it plugged in if you want to use it for a long time\nbuild quality is excellent\njust 1 problem is there .... the body gets too much heated after use(gaming) for a while\nrather than these small issues this laptop is beast ..\nif u wanna buy this then just do that dont think twice about it.",

Also we cannot extend the warranty from Acer India site. Acer Indian site doesn't have store.\n\nVR Features are awesome. Need to purchase VR goggles box for another 32k.\n\nI purchased this laptop for gaming and software simulations.\n\nI've tried GTA5, Batman Arkham Knight, Assassin's Creed Syndicate, Battlefield V and Far Cry 5.

When on charging mode u feel a bit shock near the USB ports and metal parts. Performance is nyc. Can handle any AAA title games with ease. HV played shadow of tomb raider and fifa19. When playing shadow of tomb raider which is a gpu demanding game it heats up lyk anything. Thermals should hv been good. Just would advice u guys to extend the warranty from official acer site rather dan buying flipkart extended warranty coz in acer site u get 1st Yr ADP warranty +2nd and 3rd Yr normal warranty along with 1yr free anti-virus and data recovery software.. U also get a predator mouse which costs around 3k for free.. All des for a mere cost of Rs 2359. The specs provided in dis lappy can easily fit for coming 4-5 yrs.
