            "Amazing experience from the time the package was opened till now. It's been 2 weeks. Super light weight, fantastic face recognition and sound and ui experience. Great battery backup. Camera is great. Great value, happy that I made this quality choice without spending too much !",
            "I am a stereotypical tech-nerd, so in case of using any gizmo I am biased to be critical towards a product. However this new laptop truly amazed me. It is very rare to get a market disruptor in the field of laptop(s). But in this case I have found a hidden treasure. Nokia as a brand has been in the market for quite some time and with this new entrant, it is here to stay in the laptop market.\n\nI was charmed by the built of the laptop. Sturdiness of the metal alloy body puts in a great confidence in carrying it. Small things like the quality of its hinge mechanism point out to the great engineering gone into it. In spite of all this it comes as a feathery 1.1kg machine.\nMoving on to the usability. This laptop comes with dolby vision-atmos compatibility. The industry knows that to be a mark of high end notebooks. Needless to say that media consumption is simply exceptional. The display is crisp and bright, with great colour accuracy.\nDay to day performance and utility is great as it is meant to be.\nthumbs up",
            "Over All Laptop is good but according to the price you will get much better then this . Build quality is really Good . I love the face lock it's very quick in dark also. You will enjoy this product as it's NOKIA .",
            "Loved the brand new Nokia Laptop.Its is a very very light and the speed is just wow\ud83d\udc4cHigh specs under 60k is worth buying.The built quality is also good .Worth buying for students.The face unlock system is most appreciated.Go for this product 100%",
            "Alright guys, I recently purchased NOKIA PUREBOOK. I am amazed with the performance of the laptop. I had few more options with the same price range but instead I tried my hands on NOKIA. Because everyone knows how NOKIA delivers. I am very much thankful for delivering this amazing product. So far I have been using laptop and I did not face even a single issue till now. Battery backup is fantastic, it will last around 7 hours, which is more than enough I believe. Then comes the performance. I have installed few moderate level games and python software and believe me guys, it's dead smooth. There is no heating issue as such. You give get an option to start/ stop internal fan as per your usage. But till now I I did face any heatings issues. Look wide it's fantastic. It's completely matt finish and you will love it. It's quite light in weight. Which is the major highlight part. And I also heard that it's lighter than macbook. So Nokia has delivered something which is unbelievable. Thnk you so much for the product.\nThe only issue which I have is, delivery options. I wanted a quicker deliver option, but unfortunately flipkart does not have that option. This is the sad part. I urge you guys to work on this. Because sometimes, people need products on urgent basis. And you guys did not respond to me at all. I was disappointed with the way you guys responded to me.",
            "Review After 10 days of usage...as this is my first laptop (earlier iPad user), i like the performance. As, I am basic user battery lasts for minimum of one day. I watched Dolby vision + Dolby Atmos videos using my apple airpods...simply marvellous... display awesome... it takes approximately 2 hours to charge from 10% to 100%... as it weighs only 1.1 kg, you may feel like nothing... speakers good and loud enough...",
            "Tie system is great and the built quality is also very good\nDesign is smooth and shiny and the best things is brand NOKIA",
            "I bought this laptop with a lot of inhibitions, but seems to be a good buy. I was looking for a laptop for personal use. I am not at all a technical guy & my criteria were as follows :\n1. 14 inch\n2. 512GB SSD\n3. Light weight\n4. Backlit keyboard\n5. Decent webcam.\n6. Good sound quality\nWould have perhaps bought the Mi but its a direct Chinese brand. Dell Latitude & HP were the next obvious choice but all the above features wasn't available at that price range, hence bought this laptop.\nIt's a lovely machine - feather light, quick & build quality is really good.\nIf you can afford to take risks & not scared of trying new brands, please go for it!",
            "Bought this product after watching a review by GeekyRanjit. Wanted a high performance laptop which was light and didn\u2019t cost the moon. This laptop hits the right notes on all three aspects. It\u2019s been a month since I\u2019ve been using this and so far I am completely delighted by the experience. Great product at this price point. Good for streaming Netflix with its Dolby Vision. Great processor so super fast. And at 1.1 kg, it\u2019s among the lightest laptops in the market. The build is pretty high quality too. This could be a game changer for Nokia.",
            "Ultra Light Laptop with good performance\n\nFast processing laptop value for money\n\n- Good display from every angle\n- boot speed is about 3,4 sec\n- battery is long Lasting about to 6,7 hours\n- keyboard is pretty good decent key travel is good\n- Trackpad is much preety good but not excellent\n\n\nThis is not a gaming laptop not recommended.\nIf you are traveler person then this is best choice.\nIt's build quality is superb it is aluminium chesis\nIt's not like other laptop\nAt the end\nRecommended for daily office work and students\nIf you are multimedia consumer then this laptop is perfect for you\n\nHaving many ports on this one as compared to other laptop.. so go for it if you have budget below 60k\n\nI bought this laptop for 49.9k which is best deal.",
            "I'm satisfied with this purchase and the laptop exceeds my expectations... The keys could have been slightly spaced better but you'll get used to it. It's ultra light and easy to carry.",
            "Thank you for a nice product like this. Booting and shutdown speed is in very few secs. The lightweight laptop is an added advantage. It's better to have MS office by default at this price. I would like to recommend this laptop since there is no glitch in programming, zoom/google calls, etc.",
            "For me it's a complete package. The laptop is so slim and sleek that it looks asthetic . It feels so premium as it has a metal chassy . And also it is sooo light weight or feels like you're holding a thin metal sheet .\n\nAnd the display quality is gorgeous.\n\nIt is worth every penny you give.\n\nThe sound is also loud and produces good sound.\n\nAnd gives around 5-6 hours of battery on moderate usage.\n\nIt doesn't have a fingerprint scanner but it has iris scanner\nWhich is so accurate and lightening fast.\nIt just takes less than 1 sec to recognise my eyes and not up the laptop .\n\nAnd as it has a ssd in it. The boot times are crazy fast like 3-4 sec to boot up and 2 sec for shutdown.\n\nI totally loved this product.\n\nThis is my honest review after 1 week of usage.\n\nGo for it. You'll not regret it.",
            "Got this laptop for 46000 rupees with bank discounts. This is the best i5 laptop in this price range.\nFirst I had a confusion with Mi Notebook 14 and Nokia purebook. After some research, I went for Nokia.\nThe only better thing in MI Notebook when compared to this is the 2GB GPU.\n\nThe best highlights of this laptop is the weight and looks. Even though the laptop is not from the Nokia (flipkart is the manufacturer), the Nokia brand name on the laptop looks classy.\n\nOverall it's a good purchase for me. Good Sound, Good picture quality.\nI tried some Dolby Atmos movies from Netflix.\nAlso I upgraded to windows 11 Dev release from this laptop and it works super smooth. Thanks for the SSD!!\nThe backlit keyboard and the integrated webcam which has the ability to recognize face is an added advantage.\n\nYou can go for it without any doubt for a price range below 50k, if you are reading this review in 2021.",
            "The laptop is ultra light weight and easy to carry. Performance is extremely good. Build quality is top notch. Display is crisp and bright. Speaker is loud and clear. Battery life is excellent. Overall, good package and value for money.",
            "Laptop is very premium... but please keep in mind, buy this laptop only if you want thin, light and compact one...this is small in size...maybe the smallest you've seen till now... size comparable to macbook air 13.3\"\nAnother thing is touchpad, I don't find touchpad very good and responsive, may have been better.\nBut seriously if you keep in mind these things you won't regret it buying..i guarantee",
            "1. Performance is as expected for an i5 with 8gb ram..no surprises there\n2. Display is surprisingly good.\n3. Keyboard feels a bit odd. But I think it's a matter of getting used to (backlight is helpful)\n4. Battery is as expected. 4-5 Hours in average performance.\n5. It feels super solid, very premium look and finish. Absolutely adore it. Gets smudged easily (which doesn't really bother)\n6. Window hello & trusted devices feature is a great addition.\n\nIt's super light and loaded with features. Excellent for anything except gaming and AV content creation.",
            "I suggest you go and grab this amazing purebook available at most trusted e-commerce company i.e Flipkart.\nBest Performance.\nGreat Display which can play videos of great quality i.e 4k.\nGreat RAM management.\nReally amazing NVMe SSD.\nDolby Atmos and Dolby Vision give you an ultimate Experience.\n\nAt last thank you Flikart and Nokia for this amazing experience.",
            "Since Nokia is not associated with laptops, I was a bit skeptical about this. But this laptop really matches up very comfortably to some of the more expensive laptops out there. The laptop body is premium and yet very light. 10th gen i5 combined with SSD and 8 GB RAM results in everything being super fast. Though my usage is mostly Word and PPT etc, and haven't played any heavy games on this. It doesn't get heated even after continuous Zoom calls, and sound quality is as promised. The sound is even more amazing over headphones, with Dolby enabled. Overall, a great deal.",

            "It's a terrific product ever launched like in every angle considering the price it's the best. And what's less when you can have windows 11 also in this laptop ( I m using it's insider program and the features of 11 are fascinating )\n\nPro\nEverything in it is a pro like buying it is a pro.\n\nPrecaution\nBattery is good like it works for 5-6 hrs but if you try to download the 100gb game then it decreases to 3-4 hrs .

The Dolby vision and audio are just wonderfully integrated and watching movies/online classes is a treat.\nI bought it for the brand value Nokia, though it is sold by Flipkart with Nokia brand name. Coming to the weight distribution, it is so light to carry and you could just slip it into your bag on the go.\nSSD is fast and I plan to upgrade to 16 GB. Called Flipkart support to get a Service centre contact point.\nOverall fully loaded laptop with all the essential features for running moderate to powerful office tasks.

            "Worth every penny... all latest specs with super atmos vision.\nOkay for work like VDI and running citrix\nBest for binge watching\nBest sound in this segment\nKeyboard is little mushy it requires efforts to type in initially but eventually you get habitual\nNo heating problem yet because of very good ventilation\nSmall slick and light (1.1kg)\nStylish finish..",
            "This review is after a month of usage\n\nPros:\nBuilt - Super solid, unlike other laptops in the range\n\nWeight - This is a key Differentiator.. it's so Light to fall in love with it especially if you've tired using bulky office laptops of Dell, Lenovo etc..\n\nDisplay - the Atmos display is so so good, the difference can be seen when you're watching a compatible Video on Netflix\n\nSound - Good, but not Great. But excellent when compared with peers\n\nCons:\nTrackpad: I felt the sensitivity of the track pad could have been little better for experience but i might be wrong in this as I am comparing my experience with Mac book.. again at this price it's a way better choice.",
            "Good",
            "Bought in December, working fine so far.. I wish it does not disappoint me in future as well. Thankyou Nokia and Flipkart..",
            "It\u2019s ok laptop not great. Laptop has issue with 5Ghz WiFi. It keeps disconnecting. Over continuous use processor does not respond smoothly. External display connected via dock through USB 3 has some issue. Especially after long usage, it tend to connect and disconnect again. Look like driver has some issue.",

            "Great service from Flipkart.\nOverall build quality and software experience great",
            "The Laptop is Very Good. But has few issues with the keys design. The Laptop is not good for anyone who use MS Excel most of the time. all the functions key have different functions. The F1 key works as Less Display Brightness and F2 works as more Display Brightness. Similarly the combination keys like Ctrl + F4 make the speaker off and does not close the app that was open. the F5 key does not refresh, instead it reduces the volume. so this laptop may not be good for someone who uses the short key very much and will find it very difficult to us. For all other usage it is pretty good to use. This Laptop did not fully fit my requirement as I do use Excel quite some time and I have to use the mouse now more to do the changes in the excel.",

The screen is great for all kind of media content and viewing angles are good too. It's very light weight and nimble, and perfect for someone who travels a lot. The keyboard is a but mushy, but that should not be problem per se, as the typing is good, and you can always use an external keyboard if needed. Touchpad is decent and the button placement of touchpad is not so great. The best part is that the laptop does not get heated up easily even with performance intensive apps running. Battery back up is great too. Been using the laptop for an hour everyday for the past 4 days and I still have a charge around 40%.",
