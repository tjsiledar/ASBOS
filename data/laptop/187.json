            "Value of money product. Slim and light. Backlit keyboard, comes with 2019 ms office. Decent SSD speed and 8 gb is enough Ram.\nOnly drawback is it is made of plastic but quality is good.\nI'd recommend this any day.\nFlipkart Open delivery is great way of delivering goods.\nShare OTP only if you have received original and damaged free product.\nFingerprint is in Power button and it works fine.\nWeb cam quality is decent and comes with privacy shutter.\n\nPerformance is great. Good for web browsing, office work, meetings.",
            "Laptop has a great value for money\nFast processing and the fingerprint sensor is faster than any phone\nBoot up speed is great\nSpeakers are not Very loud\nTouchpad is very responsive\nNo high heating.\nBacklit keyboard keyboard is very awesome\nI also got windows 11 updated normaly.\nVery good laptop in my opinion\nJust go for it",

            "Design is spectacular. As a minimalist, I would say this is clutter free design and small like a tablet.\n\nWindows 11 update received within hours of setup completion.\n\nFinger scanner not working properly after the update. Hope it will be corrected by windows team\n\nUse it like an Android smartphone. Lenovo sends it with bloatware free software.\n\nNo standalone Sim slot. Wifi response is awesome.",
            "Nice packing with good quality display at this price range. If you are having work like editing and rendering then take this instead of HP 15s. Nice battery backup and dolby atmos is also working fine.Overall 5/5",

            "I purchased this laptop for my daughter's online school as the existing dell one got out of order.. As it's 1qth generation i3 processor, It is more than enough for daily activities like online schools and hands on with ms office and other learning software like paints and etc..\n\nDesign is superb\nPretty light weight\nFingerprint reader is awesome.\nPre-installed win 10 and ms office is good\nBattery stays for more than 5 hours for online classes (using only chrome)\nMouse track pad and keyboard is very convenient to use.\nDisplay and sound is good.. but it can be enhanced..\n\n\nI got it in 36k in big billion days... So I think it's a value for money laptop for me..",
            "First of all big thanks to flipkart and supplier who did fantastic job to deliver it before 10 days of promised delivery.!!!\n\nPlease move away from this if anybody looking a laptop with good battery backup. Apart from battery backup all features are simply awesome. At this price range i think none of the vendor can provide this much features without compromising its quality. Main attraction is its metal body,keyboard backlit and Finger print sensor. On the delivery day itself it got upgraded to Windows 11 without any confusion. Its pretty straight forward.\n\nCons:\n\nPoor Battery backup\nSSD is only 256\nCamera clarity",
            "Really great..256 ssd is ok...\nFor study purposes it great.\nbut after one day finger print sencor is not working properly.\nrest all are good",

Finally re ordered under exchange, and got a working laptop.\nLaptop has back-lit keyboard, fast boot times, good performance on daily tasks, zero lag, superb screen to body ratio.\nFinal: Go for brands that have manufactured laptops/desktops for years, rather than investing lower amount on new entrants, as their service setup will take time..\nIf you buy this, definitely add 1 more yr of warranty by paying 1500 as it's on-site.",

            "Was doubtful on buying an i3 core for personal use as we use i5 core in office laptops, but seeing the reviews gave it a go and the result is delightful. All the features mentioned are truly defined, the only dissatisfaction for few could be the less audio output, though it doesn\u2019t matter much to me. I would say nothing is better at this range.",

            "Device is great but the only biggest Con is battery life. Battery life is extremely poor and would hardly last 2-3 hours. Expect a much poorer battery life if you're planning this device for online conferences/meetings.\nRest things like Display, Trackpad & Key travel are great.",
            "Display, size, battery and performance are all very good. But only thing that I don't like with this 14 inch laptops is the sementics of the keyboard.
